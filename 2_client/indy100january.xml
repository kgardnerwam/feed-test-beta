The Judges shall, unless provided otherwise in the competition instructions, be the Editor for the time being of indy100.com or of The Independent and/or his nominated representative(s), and "Judges" herein shall mean such person or persons. In the case of a competition involving the judging of skill there shall be at least one judge independent of  indy100.com/The Independent and any promoters, and the identity of that Judge may be given in the competition instructions. The identity of the Judges may be requested by sending a stamped addressed envelope to Promotions, Independent Digital News & Media Ltd, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT.</p><p>2.1 The general principle is fairness: entries or votes should be made or cast fairly. If, in the opinion of the Judges this principle has been flouted, they can declare any entries or votes invalid, void the competition, change the competition instructions, or adjust the entries or the voting to achieve fairness, as they think fit. The competition instructions may carry a specific indication, but in the absence of such an indication, only one entry/ vote per entrant (or household, computer or other unit as appropriate) will be permitted.</p><p>2.2 The decision of the Judges over every instance shall be final and unchallengeable and in their absolute discretion they may declare void any entry/ vote or the competition itself should they consider that there are no entries reaching a required standard, whereupon they can award prizes or not as they think fit. Judges shall have the right, at their discretion, to change the rules of a competition while it is running if it appears to them that it would be equitable or appropriate to do so, including the extension of the closing date whereupon there will be an announcement of any such extension at the first reasonable opportunity. No correspondence will be entered into or comment issued on any matters concerning any competition, and no reasons given for any decision made by the Judges.</p><p>3. All competitions are open to UK residents aged 18 or over unless any other age restriction is specified or implied. Where entrants are required to enter in one of several age categories, the applicable category shall be that appropriate to their age on the closing date of the competition. Entrants should, if under 18, obtain permission in advance from their parent or guardian and be able to demonstrate that to the Judges's satisfaction. Employees of IDNM, regular contributors and contractors, the promoters and individuals connected with any company involved in the competition, agents and members of the immediate family of the above people will not be eligible to participate.</p><p>4.1 All entries must be legible, written in ink or ballpoint pen, and made on the official form, if there is one, or the official page on the website (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk" target="_blank">www.indy</a>100.com or any other website associated with IDNM as appropriate). They must be clearly marked with the entrant's name, address, email address and telephone number as requested. Any illegible, mutilated, altered, corrupted or multiple entry may be disqualified.</p><p>4.2 Entries must be made in accordance with the competition instructions. They are invalid if they are received any later than the specified closing time (which shall be London date and time).</p><p>4.3 In the case of token collect or voucher promotions, only originals are valid. No tokens or vouchers are redeemable for cash. The provisions of Rule 11 apply to such promotions unless expressly excluded.</p><p>4.4 All questions must be answered and all other entry requirements fulfilled, including in any ‘pay to enter’ competition each entry must be accompanied by the appropriate entry fee or proof of purchase as appropriate.</p><p>4.5 Proof of submission or of posting of a form will not constitute proof of delivery and no responsibility will be accepted for lost, corrupted, delayed or mislaid entries.</p><p>4.6 The winner will be chosen in accordance with the competition instructions and the exercise of their residual discretion by the Judges, and either will be the first correct entry drawn from the total entries or all entries will be examined and the prize awarded to the entry that the Judges consider to be the best.</p><p>4.7 Other prizes will be awarded in accordance with the order of priority as stated in the individual competition.</p><p>5. IDNM reserves the right to publish the names of the winners and runners-up, and the winning entries themselves, and all winners are required to give their full co-operation to all requests by IDNM or a promoter in connection with publicity for the competition, their entry, the prize or otherwise.</p><p>6. IDNM shall have the following rights over all winning entries:- the exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide licence to first publication; and a non-exclusive licence to publish, syndicate, distribute, reproduce and exploit the material in all present and future media and formats and to sub-license these rights to others. Entries, however submitted, will not be returned by IDNM.</p><p>7. There will be no cash or other alternative to the prize offered and prizes are not transferable.</p><p>8. Where applicable, prize winners will be responsible for organising valid passport(s) and for securing any necessary visas or complying with other regulation. They are also strongly advised to take out adequate insurance and health advice. Dates, destinations and other specific details of a prize are subject to availability.</p><p>9.1 IDNM will not be liable for any circumstances beyond its reasonable control that prevent the competition being fulfilled, a winner or winners being chosen, or any prize being taken up or fully enjoyed by a winner. IDNM excludes liability to the extent permitted by law for any cost, claims or losses howsoever caused that arise by reason of any person's entry into a competition or the award, or non award, to them of a prize. In the event of any error, whether printing, technological or otherwise, which affects the competition in any way, the Judges reserve the right to administer the competition as though the error had not occurred.</p><p>9.2 If any winner of a competition is unable to take up a prize for any reason, or if IDNM has not been able, after making reasonable efforts, to make contact with the winner, IDNM reserves the right to award that prize (without notice to the first winner chosen) to an alternative winner, in which case the first winner chosen shall not be eligible for any share of the prize whatsoever. IDNM shall not have any liability in such eventuality.</p><p>10. Where necessary in order to determine an outright winner or winners in a competition, the Judges reserve the right to require that entrants take part in an eliminating contest (or 'tie breaker'). If for any reason there are more winners than prizes, whether or not that has arisen as an unforeseen eventuality or is part of the competition structure, the Judges reserve the right to conduct a draw to determine the winner or winners of the prizes.</p><p>11. In any competition where there are only a limited number of prizes, unless it is otherwise provided no purchase of the newspaper or otherwise is necessary for entry, except in competitions of skill or where competition instructions clearly specify otherwise.</p><p>12. Names of major prize winners will be available on receipt of a request enclosing a stamped addressed envelope to: Promotions, IDNM, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT, and this information may be published on the website at the Judges' discretion.</p><p>13. Entrants may be asked to indicate their wish, by ticking or checking a box provided in the competition instructions or otherwise, to receive or decline to receive communications with information or carefully selected commercial opportunities from IDNM or agents on their behalf. IDNM will hold any personal details it is entitled to hold on its own or a duly authorised agent's registered database for the purposes of optimising its editorial and commercial offering to readers and website users, actual or potential. Entrants will also be asked to indicate their consent to have that data used from time to time by other carefully selected organisations who may be licensed by IDNM to use it.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 16:48:02 GMT</pubDate><guid>2655937906</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image"/><dc:creator>Indy100 Staff</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 11:21:51+00:00</dc:date><category>Service</category></item><item><title>Privacy Notice</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/service/privacy-notice</link><description><![CDATA[<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>This privacy notice is for visitors to our websites, apps and other digital platforms.

In this notice ‘we’ and ‘our’ means Independent Digital News and Media Limited which operates this platform.</p><p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p><p>For almost any modern website to work properly, it needs to collect certain basic information on its users. To do this, a site will create files known as cookies – which are small text files – on its users’ computers, tablets or mobile devices. These cookies are designed to allow the website to recognise its users on subsequent visits, or to authorise other designated websites to recognise these users for a particular purpose.</p><p>Cookies do a lot of different jobs which make your experience of the Internet much smoother and more interactive. For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to help you navigate between pages more efficiently. They also help ensure that the advertisements that you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

Amongst other things, the cookies we use allow users to register to make comments, allow us to calculate how many visitors we have and how long they stay on our site.</p><p>We do our utmost to respect users’ privacy. We use cookies to monitor and improve our services, but they do also allow us to sell advertising campaigns that are tailored to your interests and reading behaviour on our website, which helps keeps our content free to our readers. We sometimes include links on our site to goods and services offered by third parties and we may be paid some commission if you subsequently decide to make a purchase. Cookies may be used to track your visits to third party sites to help ensure that we are paid the correct amounts. Please note that these commercial arrangements do not influence our editorial content in any way.</p><p>We believe that your experience of the site would be adversely affected if you opted out of the cookies we use.</p><p><strong>What types of cookie are there and which ones do we use?</strong></p><p>There are two types of cookie:</p><ul><li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> remain on a user’s device for a set period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</li><li><strong>Session cookies</strong> are temporary. They allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</li></ul><p>Cookies also have, broadly speaking, four different functions and can be categorised as follow: ‘strictly necessary’ cookies, ‘performance’ cookies, ‘functionality’ cookies and ‘targeting’ or ‘advertising’ cookies.</p><p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> are essential to navigate around a website and use its features. Without them, you wouldn’t be able to use basic services like registration or shopping baskets. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p><p>Examples of how we use ‘strictly necessary’ cookies include:</p><p>• Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so site numbers can be analysed.</p><p>• Allowing you to sign in to Indy100.com as a registered user or subscriber.</p><p><strong>Performance cookies</strong> collect data for statistical purposes on how visitors use a website, they don’t contain personal information such as names and email addresses, and are used to improve your user experience of a website.</p><p>Here are some examples of how we use performance cookies:</p><ul><li>Gathering data about visits to the website, including numbers of visitors and visits, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked on or where visitors have come from.</li><li>For comparison with other websites using data collected by industry-accepted measurement and research companies.</li></ul><p>Information supplied by performance cookies helps us to understand how you use the website; for example, whether or not you have visited before, what you looked at or clicked on and how you found us. We can then use this data to help improve our services. We generally use independent analytics companies to perform these services for us and when this is the case, these cookies may be set by a third party company (third party cookies).</p><p>If you have registered with the website we can combine the data from the web analytics services and their cookies with the information you have supplied to us, so that we can make your experience more personal by recommending certain articles to you based on your reading behaviour or tailoring your emails with content you might find more interesting. We would only do this if you have given us permission to communicate with you. Sometimes the data used from the web analytics companies has been collected before you registered or signed in. In these cases, if we use this data to identify you, we use it only in accordance with our privacy notice.</p><p><strong>Functionality cookies</strong> allow users to customise how a website looks for them: they can remember usernames, language preferences and regions, and can be used to provide more personal services like local weather reports and traffic news.</p><p>Here are some examples of how we use functionality cookies:</p><ul><li>Storing your user preferences on Your Account page</li><li>Remembering if you’ve been to the site before so that messages intended for first-time users are not displayed to you.</li></ul><p><strong>Advertising cookies</strong> are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you, but can also limit the number of times you see an advertisement, and be used to chart the effectiveness of an ad campaign by tracking users’ clicks. They can also provide security in transactions. They are usually placed by third-party advertising networks with a website operator’s permission, but can be placed by the operator themselves. They can remember that you have visited a website, and this information can be shared with other organisations, including other advertisers. They cannot determine who you are though, as the data collected is never linked to your profile.</p><p>The main ways we use advertising cookies are set out below:</p><ul><li>Interest-based advertising (or online behavioural advertising) is where cookies are placed on your device by our third party service providers which remember your web browsing activity and group together your interests in order to provide you with targeted advertisements which are more relevant to you when you visit independent.co.uk. Your previous web browsing activity can also be used to infer things about you, such as your demographics (age, gender etc). This information may also be used to make the advertising on independent.co.uk more relevant to you.</li><li>‘Retargeting’ is a form of interest-based advertising that enables our advertising partners to show you advertisements selected based on your online browsing activity away from the website. This allows companies to advertise to people who previously visited their website. These cookies will usually be placed on your device by third-party advertising networks and we have listed the main third party networks we work with in our consent management platform.</li><li>Social media. Occasionally we advertise our products and services to our readers who are on social media. This could be to promote our subscriptions offers or events. We use cookies to help with this process, and the social media operator (Facebook for example) can recognise Indy100.com readers who are on their platform and serve them advertisements on our behalf. You can opt out of this process by managing your preferences in our consent management platform.</li></ul><p>Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.</p><p><strong>How do I manage my cookies?</strong></p><p>You should be aware that any preferences will be lost if you delete all cookies and many websites will not work properly or you will lose some functionality. We do not recommend turning cookies off when using our website for these reasons.</p><p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can alter the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. Generally you have the option to see what cookies you’ve got and delete them individually, block third party cookies or cookies from particular sites, accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is issued or reject all cookies.

VARIATION OF THESE TERMS</strong></p><p>1. These Terms will not be varied, the only exception to that would be in the event that a Director of the Company or the Editor has expressly agreed in writing to a variation. If any Freelancer or external contributor is not happy with these Terms then they should not offer the Company any Material, nor accept a commission, nor post any comments on the Website including Blogs. Any Material posted or supplied to the Company for publication is deemed to have been supplied in full knowledge and acceptance of these Terms.</p><p>2. The Company may change these Terms at any time by posting the changes online and it is your responsibility to check them every time you: submit Material for publication, access the blog or forum areas of the Company’s Websites or wish to make a comment. If any freelancer or blogger is not happy with these Terms then they should not offer us any Material or accept a commission from us. Any Material supplied to us for publication is deemed to have been supplied in full knowledge and acceptance of the most recent updated Terms as displayed on the Company’s Websites. Your continued or renewed use of the Company’s Websites after such changes are posted means you agree to be bound by these Terms as amended.</p><p><strong>C. EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTIONS COVERED BY THESE TERMS</strong></p><p><strong>Material supplied by:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Freelancers</strong></p><p>- The Company is happy to publish Material which is supplied by freelance contributors (‘Freelancers’); it is showcased in the titles daily and appreciated worldwide by readers and users of the Websites.</p><p>- Freelancers should be aware that these Terms are the terms of business that will apply to all Material you provide however supplied - commissioned, sent on spec or any other arrangement.</p><p><strong>2.Bloggers</strong></p><p>- The Company also considers and on occasion publishes Material which has been researched and written by ‘Bloggers’.

As is the case with other publishers, the Company needs to have certain rights to allow it to make further use of the contents of the newspaper titles and Websites.</p><p>In addition to the content of the Company’s publications appearing online on the Website, Material is also supplied by the Company to the websites of other third party hosts, thereby ensuring that the quality writing the Company publishes is widely available to interested readers on a variety of websites.</p><p>Content is further supplied by the Company to a range of newspapers, magazines, websites, on mobile and tablet apps, and other media outlets rights are licensed to a range of third parties.</p><p><strong>The Company will require the exclusive right to first publication in any medium in the case of commissioned Material; if not, this will be made clear to you in writing by your editorial contact at the Company. There may be occasions when there is a delay in publishing your Material. Should this be the case, after a reasonable time has elapsed from the date when you submitted your Material, it may be possible to request a waiver by the Company of its exclusive right to first publication of your Material. Such a variation to these Terms must be negotiated with your editorial contact at the Company in writing.</strong></p><p>Unless otherwise agreed:</p><p>(a).

You are free to store and allow access to your Material on databases for personal purposes provided nothing competes or conflicts with the rights you have granted the Company; and</p><p>(c)(ii) in respect of all of the above, the right to translate, amend, cut or alter your Material as the Company thinks appropriate.</p><p>(c)(iii) the right to authorise NLA Media Access (“NLA”) to distribute or license the distribution of your Material for NLA’s licensed acts and purposes as amended from time to time.</p><p>(d) The exercise by you of any of these rights is conditional on it not leading to any conflict of interest with the Company, and to your procuring a proper acknowledgement to the Company and its product is given on any further use of your Material together where possible with a link to the Material on the Website.</p><p>(e) You agree that the Company can use an image of you in association with your Material for purposes of publicity, promotion and any other activity related to the exercise of its rights under these Terms.</p><p><strong>D.2) PAYMENT / CONSIDERATION</strong></p><p>D.2.(a) If your editorial contact from the Company has agreed to pay you a fee for your Material, such a fee will be a single all-inclusive fee for all the rights granted above (including the syndication rights in D.1). If such a fee has been agreed, and there follows a one-off syndication of an individual Contribution to an end-user customer for print publication, you will additionally receive 50% of the net revenue received by the Company.</p><p>The Company operates a self billing system for the payment of freelance Contributions. New Freelancers should supply their payment details and email address to the commissioning editor or the person to whom they have arranged to supply their Material, on the first occasion of supply. Unless any other rate or fee is agreed at the time of commission/ agreement any payment will be made at the Company's prevailing rates.</p><p>Payment will be made at the end of the month following the month of publication of the Material.</p><p>D.2.(b) Whether or not a monetary fee has been agreed, you agree that for your Material to be considered for publication is adequate consideration for the rights granted herein.</p><p><strong>D.3) EDITORIAL STANDARDS</strong></p><p>The reputation of the Independent brand, in the UK and around the world, is based on the editorial independence, integrity and high journalistic standards of the Company's publications.

You will not at any time dispose of any materials which could be relevant to a potential complaint without our prior approval. You agree to notify us at once should you discover anything which could render your Material or a story wholly or partly based on your Material risky from a legal or regulatory point of view or potentially place you in breach of any of these Terms.</p><p>You agree that you will not talk to any person about a complaint without our prior approval and will maintain confidence in the story before publication and, as far as is appropriate, after publication.</p><p>One matter in the Company's Code of Conduct that requires immediate action is that you must tell us about any potential conflict of interest, whether actual or potential, as well as anything which could possibly be perceived as such. You should raise any issue, preferably in writing by email to the person with whom you have contact in the Company.</p><p>It is also a term of acceptance of your Material that you agree to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p><p>If you have any query on these points, or uncertainty about any aspect of conduct or the Material you are submitting, you should raise it with the person with whom you have contact in the Company.</p><p><strong>D.4) WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES AND LIABILITY</strong></p><p>D.4.(i).

The fabric feels expensive and deliciously smooth, and the bra provides a snug fit for small (as seen on the model above) and ample busts (a la this cardio-addicted writer) alike. &nbsp;While those of us on the larger end of the spectrum may experience a bit of, eh, <i>squishing</i>, the thin pads inside for lining are easily moved to the side to give more of a lift than a smoosh, plus nothing is ever at risk of falling out unexpectedly.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also no excessive cutting into the areas around the arms and back, and wearing something this bright and fun adds an instant boost to any workout.  Definitely invest in one of these sports bras if you want to feel good before, during, and after your workout, and grab the <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.berealwear.com/product-page/power-leggings">matching leggings</a> for a complete look. </p>

The "Brazilian bubble" design fabric conceals lumps and bumps while smoothing any bulges, and the halter neckline makes this a great piece of athleisure that goes from the yoga mat to the grocery store without losing an ounce of attitude. Another bonus: There are more than 30 color options available, so you don’t have to commit to the leopard option we love if it’s too loud for your tastes.&nbsp;</p>

They come in a variety of colors and fabrics, even in a sexy lace pattern, so snag a few pairs for your every mood and outfit and never suffer the soreness of inner thigh chafing again.&nbsp;</p>
