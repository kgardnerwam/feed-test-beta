I&#x2019;ve been thinking of getting [the tattoo] for the last three to four months. Every time I go in there they ask if I&#x2019;ve got my Clubcard but it&#x2019;s always at home or I&#x2019;ve lost it.&quot;</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/newsletters?itm_channel=native&amp;itm_campaign=footer&amp;itm_audience=prospecting&amp;itm_content=newsletters" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter</strong></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><img class="rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image" data-rm-shortcode-id="b21a61294f66ffd5a66df76d9ebd168d" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=30275073&amp;width=980" height="5504" id="64415" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&apos;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&apos; viewBox=&apos;0 0 8256 5504&apos;%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="8256"><figcaption>SWNS</figcaption></p><p></p><p><strong></strong>Dean, from Horsham, Sussex, spent half an hour getting the tattoo earlier this month (16/07) at A Star Tattoo in Chessington, Surrey. He and his tattoo artist - Dan Rossetter, 39 - then visited the local Tesco Express to find out if it worked.</p><p>&#x201C;I tried the self-checkout but it was quite awkward to use because I wasn&#x2019;t doing it right so I said &apos;let me go to the guy on the till&apos; &#x2013; I went up there and it worked,&#x201D; said Dean.</p><p>&#x201C;He couldn&#x2019;t believe it. Every time I go in there they&#x2019;re shocked and it&#x2019;s good to see people&#x2019;s faces. I could use the one on my phone but I want to use the one on my arm as it&#x2019;s funny.</p><p>&#x201C;Anything you can do with a normal Clubcard I can do with my arm. The tattoo is still in the healing process at the moment and still scabby. I don&#x2019;t know if it will still work when it&#x2019;s healed but I don&#x2019;t see why it wouldn&#x2019;t. I don&#x2019;t regret stuff - I&#x2019;m not one of those people. I don&#x2019;t think it looks bad - I think it looks pretty cool.&#x201D;</p><p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><img class="rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image" data-rm-shortcode-id="8464dab03e81e022dcb85c659aa1a0ab" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=30275110&amp;width=980" height="5127" id="36c12" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&apos;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&apos; viewBox=&apos;0 0 7690 5127&apos;%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="7690"><figcaption>SWNS</figcaption></p><p>Tattoo artist Dan said: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been tattooing for 12 years so I&#x2019;ve seen a lot but I&#x2019;d never seen a Tesco Clubcard as an idea before. At first I said &#x2018;are you sure you want to do this&#x2019; but I saw the fun within it and thought &#x2018;let&apos;s do it&#x2019;.</p><p>&#x201C;I was anxious about how well it was likely to work as it&apos;s an intricate bar code but Dean was quite relaxed about it and was going for the fun aspect &#x2013; he said if it didn&#x2019;t work it wasn&#x2019;t the end of the world.</p><p>&#x201C;I did the tattoo and we decided to pop to Tesco down the road &#x2013; we went to the self-service checkout but because of the way the scanner is situated he couldn&#x2019;t get his arm flat enough and we thought it didn&#x2019;t work. We went to the till and a person with a scanner tried and on the first go it worked, Dean&#x2019;s face lit up and I realised it actually did work.</p><p>&#x201C;I think I&#x2019;m always quite a fun outgoing type of guy anyway so it was a bit of banter and there is the element of it being a genius idea &#x2013; it&apos;s not something I would have come up with off the top of my head, to be honest, I thought it was quite cool.&#x201D;</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><img class="rm-shortcode rm-lazyloadable-image" data-rm-shortcode-id="9ca738da599b45f47cb80affa721e126" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" data-runner-src="https://www.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=30275087&amp;width=980" height="1374" id="b1d18" lazy-loadable="true" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=&apos;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&apos; viewBox=&apos;0 0 960 1374&apos;%3E%3C/svg%3E" width="960"><figcaption>SWNS</figcaption></p><p>Dean also admitted that he has considered getting a Nectar card for when he shops at Sainsbury&apos;s - because he often forgets that too.</p><p>&#x201C;I did think about getting another one but that&#x2019;s a whole other thing,&quot; he said.</p><p>&#x201C;I quite often go between Sainsbury&apos;s and Tesco&apos;s and I forget that card too &#x2013; I&apos;d get my Nectar card tattooed on me. I&#x2019;d probably get it on the same arm, just above the Tesco one really &#x2013; I&apos;ve already got one so why not get the other.</p><p>&#x201C;I wouldn&#x2019;t say it&#x2019;s a clever idea but it&#x2019;s just one of those things &#x2013; it&apos;s funny and it would definitely be useful. I think it&#x2019;s a good idea &#x2013; I have had a few people suggest the Sainsbury&#x2019;s one, when I posted it on Facebook people said I would be doing Nectar next and I thought that was a good idea.</p><p>&#x201C;I did try and have a look on the internet and I reckon I&#x2019;m the only person &#x2013; I tried to find someone else with them and no one else has got them, I&#x2019;d be the only person with both.&#x201D;</p><p><strong><em>Have your say in our news democracy.
