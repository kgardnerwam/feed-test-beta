            <p>A 7-year-old boy died in a freak sledding accident in the mountains near Palm Springs Sunday.</p>

    
            <p>Michael Rigg was sledding in the mountain town of Idyllwild-Pine Cove Sunday afternoon when he accidentally collided with a 2020 Ford Transit cargo van.</p>

    <div id="paywall" class="content-wrapper">
            <p>According to the <a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/2021/03/14/absolute-tragedy-boy-7-dies-after-being-hit-vehicle-near-idyllwild/4695551001/">Desert Sun</a> in Palm Springs, the boy sledded down a driveway and slid under the van, sustaining severe injuries in the crash.</p>

    
            <p>He and his family was visiting friends in Pine Cove from Beaumont, a town about 25 miles east of Riverside.</p>

    
            <p>The driver involved in the accident, a 35-year-old man, transported Michael to a fire station about seven miles away &#x2014; where he was pronounced dead just an hour after the accident, according to the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner&#x2019;s Office.</p>

            <p>It is unclear what caused the crash, but officials ruled out intoxication and speeding as factors, per the Desert Sun. The street has a 25 mph speed limit and is narrow and circuitous, with trees covering the roadside.</p>

            <p>California will update county tier assignments Tuesday, and in the San Francisco Bay Area, San Mateo county is expected to advance from the red tier to the less restrictive orange tier, allowing many indoor activities including dining to increase indoor capacity.</p>

    
            <p>The state announced last week that 13 counties are likely to shift from purple to red today, including Kings, Lake, Monterey, Riverside, Sacramento, San Diego, San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, Sutter, Tehama, Tulare, Ventura and Yuba.</p>

    <div id="paywall" class="content-wrapper">
            <p>In the Bay Area, all nine counties have already progressed to the red tier in the state&apos;s reopening framework.</p>

            <p>It has been more than a month since Gov. Gavin Newsom lifted the regional stay-at-home order on Jan. 25 and counties fell back within the color-coded reopening framework.</p>

    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>The state&apos;s system sorts counties into four tiers &#x2014; &quot;purple&quot; (widespread), &quot;red&quot; (substantial), &quot;orange&quot; (moderate) or &quot;yellow&quot; (minimal) &#x2014; that measure the spread of COVID-19 and dictate what types of businesses and activities are allowed to open.</p>

    
            <p>A county&apos;s tier assignment is based on three metrics: the adjusted case rate (number of new cases per 100,000 residents, adjusted based on testing volume); the positivity rate (percentage of people who test positive for the virus of all individuals who are tested); a health equity metric; and the number of vaccines administered.</p>

    
    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>Counties in the purple category are <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">reportin</a>g more than 10 new daily cases per 100,000 residents and have positivity rates above 8%. For a county to move into the red tier, it must report an average of four to 10 daily cases per 100,000 residents and a test positivity of 5% to 8% for 14 consecutive days. The orange tier requires one to 3.9 cases per 100,000 and a test positivity of 2% to 4.9%, and the yellow less than one case per 100,000 and lower than 2% positivity.</p>

    
    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>Here&apos;s what the state will allow to reopen in San Mateo if it moves into orange:</p>

    
            <p>-Indoor capacity at places of worship increases to 50%</p>

    
            <p>-Indoor capacity at museums and zoos increases to 50%</p>

            <p>Nearly every season of &quot;The Bachelor,&quot; there&apos;s a stark disconnect between what was filmed and where the final couple is now, months after the cameras stopped rolling. That&apos;s especially true this season featuring Matt James - a 29-year-old real estate broker from New York who&apos;s the first Black man to star on the show.</p>

    
            <p>As Monday night&apos;s finale opens on a snowy NemacolinResort in Farmington, Pa., viewers are reminded that before we can get answers to what happened with Rachael Kirkconnell, the 24-year-old graphic designer from Georgia who&apos;s sparked controversy over her racially insensitive social media posts, we will need to sit through two hours of James deciding who to pick and whether to propose.</p>

    <div id="paywall" class="content-wrapper">
            <p>The wait is a little excruciating.</p>

            <p>Last month, internet sleuths found that Kirkconnell had &quot;liked&quot; a post of friends posing in front of a Confederate flag; shared an Instagram post whose language echoed the QAnon extremist ideology; dressed in a Native American costume; and attended an &quot;Old South&quot; antebellum-themed party in college in 2018. She has since apologized. Chris Harrison has apologized for how he&apos;s handled the revelation; he&apos;s stepped aside from hosting the &quot;After the Final Rose&quot; special and from the next season of &quot;The Bachelorette.&quot;</p>

            <p>But the version of James we see in the finale&apos;s first two hours doesn&apos;t know any of that. At this point, the heaviest thing James is confronting is whether he&apos;s ready to get engaged. As James&apos;s mother and brother meet his two finalists, Michelle Young, a 27-year-old teacher from Minnesota, and Kirkconnell, they&apos;re very frank with James. His brother, John, asks the two women tough questions about their past relationships and whether they&apos;ve been in love before. James&apos;s mother is real with him about how loving someone isn&apos;t always enough to make a marriage work, and she knows that from experience.</p>

    
    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>James&apos;s mother says it&apos;s a &quot;long shot&quot; that her son is ready to get engaged, and, well, she&apos;s right. Wracked with doubt, James speaks to Harrison on a curb, and the show&apos;s host is completely unhelpful, telling James: &quot;This is not the guy I talked to a week ago.&quot; The Bachelor walks away asking himself: &quot;Am I ready? Can I get there? ... What&apos;s the right thing to do?&quot;</p>

    
            <p>James goes on a final date with Young, where they rappel down the resort wall. It&apos;s terrifying, and afterward Young gives James a speech about what great teammates they&apos;d make for one another, gifting him a jersey with Mr. James emblazoned on the back to match her Mrs. James. This is the moment James uses to express that he&apos;s not sure about an engagement, blindsiding her instead with a breakup.</p>

    
    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>Next, James skips his final date with Kirkconnell, leaving Harrison to deliver the news that he won&apos;t be showing up. Later, she receives a date card, instructing her to meet James by the lake. When she shows up in a sparkly green gown, nervous and unsmiling, James tells her that he wants to be &quot;everything to you,&quot; but he doesn&apos;t want to rush a proposal. &quot;The truth is that I love you,&quot; James tells Kirkconnell, adding that he sees her as the mother of his kids. And he just wanted to know if being together is enough for her. It is. &quot;I picture it all with you,&quot; Kirkconnell says. &quot;You&apos;re the most amazing person I&apos;ve ever met.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>&quot;It doesn&apos;t get more real than this,&quot; James proclaims before the happy couple gets into a horse-drawn carriage, completely naive to how real their relationship will get in a few short months.</p>

    
            <p>Emmanuel Acho, a former NFL linebacker and host of the video series &quot;Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man&quot; introduces himself to viewers at home. The studio is eerily quiet without an in-person audience. Acho first speaks with Young about her breakup with James and the closure she&apos;d like to get. James apologizes to Young for leaving her hanging in Nemacolin, and not having one last conversation there when she requested it. &quot;My respect and admiration for you is through the roof,&quot; he tells her. &quot;All I can say is: I&apos;m sorry.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>Afterward, Acho asks James about the pressure of being the first Black Bachelor. &quot;As a Black person, there&apos;s a extra level of scrutiny when you&apos;re the first of something,&quot; James says, &quot;and you want to make sure that you&apos;re on your best behavior in terms of how you&apos;re speaking, how you present yourself. Because, for a lot of people, that was the first time having someone like myself in their home.&quot; All of that on top of the weight of looking for love on national television.</p>

    
            <p>James tells Acho that he first fell in love with Kirkconnell&apos;s &quot;authenticity,&quot; but things got difficult when her social media posts started to surface. Before Kirkconnell addressed the images publicly, or Harrison said anything about them, James said he tried to be there for her, because he thought they were just rumors. But when she publicly acknowledged that she would do better and she apologized, James started to realize he &quot;wasn&apos;t OK&quot; and that Kirkconnell might not understand what it means to be Black in America. Ultimately, he tells Acho, they broke up.</p>

    
            <p>Kirkconnell arrives looking like she would rather be anywhere else. When Acho asks how she&apos;s holding up, she lets out a sad laugh.</p>

    
            <p>&quot;It&apos;s a loaded question,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s been a lot, as anyone can imagine. But I don&apos;t want to, you know, sit here and victimize myself.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>Acho dives right in and shows the infamous photo from the antebellum plantation-themed college party, with Kirkconnell and two friends beaming in ballgowns. Acho explains that in Latin, antebellum literally means &quot;before the war,&quot; so an antebellum party is actually celebrating a pre-Civil War, slavery-era South.</p>

    
            <p>Kirkconnell explains that back then, she didn&apos;t really consider what such an image or a party really meant. &quot;I never took the time to make that connection. Because if I would have taken the time, I easily could&apos;ve understood what was wrong with it,&quot; she said. And even though she&apos;s seen people defend her by saying she&apos;s from Georgia, she doesn&apos;t want to blame her Southern upbringing: &quot;That doesn&apos;t make it right.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>&quot;I think we need to all collectively do a better job of acknowledging that history is meant to be remembered, but not all history is meant to be celebrated,&quot; Acho says. After he asks Kirkconnell what steps she&apos;s taking to learn and grow from this experience (she said she&apos;s been reading books, watching documentaries and listening to podcasts to educate herself), Acho questions whether Kirkconnell ever lay awake at night worrying that these photos would emerge someday, especially because &quot;The Bachelor&quot; star was a Black man.</p>

    
            <p>&quot;Being completely honest, I didn&apos;t think about it one time. Because at that point, you know, it was just me taking some photos with my friends,&quot; she replies. &quot;... I didn&apos;t think of the trauma that it would cause.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>Finally, Kirkconnell says she was &quot;blindsided&quot; when James broke up with her, and that she&apos;s still in love with him. &quot;I lost the love of my life, but in the process of that, I hurt him while doing so,&quot; she says. Acho asks if she&apos;s ready to reunite with him. She confirms that she is not but knows it&apos;s about to happen regardless.</p>

            <p>As James arrives onstage, he and Kirkconnell share a hug, and things immediately become emotional.</p>

    
            <p>&quot;I really just want to take the time to say I&apos;m really sorry. And once I really tried to put myself into your shoes as much as I could, I really do think that our relationship was very strong, and the love that we shared was very real,&quot; Kirkconnell says. &quot;So for you to end things ... you must have been hurting, and I just wanted to say I&apos;m really sorry for not understanding that initially.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>&quot;How hard is this on you, just seeing the woman that you love - that you loved - so torn up over hurting you and over losing you?&quot; Acho asks James.</p>

    
            <p>James looks pained. &quot;I mean, it&apos;s heartbreaking, and it&apos;s devastating. It&apos;s just disappointing.&quot; When Acho prods him to share more, there&apos;s a long pause as he can&apos;t bring himself to speak. Eventually, they cut to commercial.</p>

    
            <p>When they return, James still looks devastated as he starts to explain that he couldn&apos;t get over Kirkconnell&apos;s reaction to the photos when they surfaced online, and implies that she didn&apos;t understand why they mattered.</p>

    
            <p>&quot;The most disappointing thing for me was having to explain to you why what I saw was problematic and why I was so upset. And that&apos;s why it was problematic,&quot; he says. &quot;... When I questioned our relationship, it was in the context of you not fully understanding my Blackness and what it means to be a Black man in America. And what it would mean for our kids when I saw those things that were floating around the internet. And it broke my heart, because this is the last conversation I thought we&apos;d be having.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>&quot;And I knew that I had to take a step back for you to put in that work that you outlined that you needed to do, and that&apos;s something that you&apos;ve got to do on your own,&quot; he concludes. &quot;And that&apos;s why we can&apos;t be in a relationship.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>Kirkconnell accepts this, as James confirms that while his feelings for her can&apos;t just disappear overnight, a reconciliation is not likely. Finally, it&apos;s time for Acho to wrap things up. &quot;Well, if you all want to share one final embrace ...&quot; he offers.</p>

    
            <p>Neither Kirkconnell nor James make a move. James breaks the silence: &quot;I don&apos;t know if it&apos;ll ever not hurt hearing those things.&quot; There is no embrace.</p>

    
            <p>After an awkward pause, Acho smoothly moves on. &quot;Well, thank you all both for being here. I know that was difficult. Couldn&apos;t have been easy.&quot;</p>

    
            <p>In the show&apos;s final moments, we learn our next &quot;Bachelorette&quot; star will be Katie Thurston, a 30-year-old bank marketing manager from Renton, Wash., who made a splash when she first introduced herself to James while holding a vibrator. Her season will premiere in the summer, Acho says. And then Young will do a season as the Bachelorette, premiering in the fall.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[
            <p>OAKLAND, Calif. &#x2014; One year ago at the Hatch, a narrow neighborhood bar in downtown Oakland, dozens of unmasked people crowded inside to say goodbye for a while. California&#x2019;s governor had just ordered the nation&#x2019;s first effective coronavirus lockdown, and the bar&#x2019;s staff and regulars thought they wouldn&#x2019;t be back for weeks, maybe even months.</p>

    
            <p>So began an arduous year. The coronavirus killed more than 500,000 people in the United States and forced more than 100,000 small businesses to close for good. At the Hatch, some of the staff fought for the bar&#x2019;s survival. Others just tried to survive.</p>

    <div id="paywall" class="content-wrapper">
            <p>The New York Times followed the bar and its employees for the first months after the lockdown, chronicling overdue bills, missed rent payments, a failing takeout business and cancer diagnoses. In the middle of a second lockdown in December, as coronavirus deaths broke records daily, the bar&#x2019;s owner, Louwenda Kachingwe, known as Pancho, said he thought the Hatch might have served its last beer.</p>

            <p>He is happy he was wrong. On a recent Saturday, a masked bartender handed beer and Tater Tots out of a takeout window cut into the kitchen wall. Groups gathered around picnic tables on a patio that was previously a lane of traffic. A DJ broadcast hip-hop onto the sidewalk. And a man on roller skates bounced to the music, drink in hand.</p>

            <p>The Hatch is alive, albeit as a different place. It is one of hundreds of thousands of bars and restaurants that have scraped by over the past year, finding ways to survive. Many have relied on government aid and donations, and nearly all of them have had to be creative and adapt.</p>

            <p>In the United States, 260,000 businesses, including 85,000 restaurants, have reopened over the past year, according to a report last week from Yelp. In September, Yelp reported that the pandemic had forced nearly 100,000 businesses to close permanently.</p>

            <p>At the Hatch, Kachingwe used ingenuity and a bit of good fortune to take advantage of federal money and discounted leases to not only hold on but expand.</p>

    
            <p>Last month, he and the Hatch&#x2019;s manager, Robin Easterbrook, opened Pothead, a flower and wine shop, next door to the Hatch. They also took on a third lease in the empty space next to Pothead as a place to build larger floral arrangements for events, to stage a new operation making bottled cocktails and sauces, and to sublease the storefront to some friends&#x2019; apparel business.</p>

    
    <!-- Missed: ad -->

            <p>Such a bet in the midst of a pandemic was bold, but Kachingwe saw opportunity. He had just received his second $72,500 forgivable loan from the federal government, and his landlord was desperate. So Kachingwe negotiated a deal that gave him access to the three adjacent storefronts for $7,500 a month, or 20% more than what he was paying for only the Hatch before the virus. The landlord said they would assess the arrangement at the end of April.</p>

    
            <p>Kachingwe said he had tried to reassure his employees for months that his plans just needed time to work. &#x201C;Now we&#x2019;re finally getting there,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;That seems to be a big turning point for the entire staff, going from being depressed by the pandemic to being like, &#x2018;OK, maybe things will turn around.&#x2019; &#x201D;</p>

    
            <p>Yet some members of his staff are struggling.</p>

    
            <p>Santos, one of the Hatch&#x2019;s two cooks, who asked to be identified only by his first name because of his family&#x2019;s immigration status, has been stuck for months in his three-bedroom home, which he shared with 11 relatives on the outskirts of Oakland. He had complications after hernia surgery in June, and hasn&#x2019;t worked since. The Hatch&#x2019;s new takeout business was so slow, he also wasn&#x2019;t needed.</p>

    
            <p>In December, Santos&#x2019; daughter moved out with her four children, leaving fewer people to split the nearly $3,000 monthly rent. That was particularly difficult without the $2,500 he used to take home each month from the Hatch. To get by, he and his children who still lived with him borrowed money from relatives and frequented food banks. He received a visa in 2019 after arriving in the United States a decade earlier from Guatemala, but he hasn&#x2019;t received any unemployment or stimulus checks.</p>

    
            <p>&#x201C;I need to work,&#x201D; he said in Spanish. &#x201C;For everything &#x2014; the rent, other needs, the family in Guatemala.&#x201D;</p>

    
            <p>There is good news. A second surgery has eased the pain from the first, and Santos is scheduled to return to the Hatch&#x2019;s cramped kitchen this week.</p>

    
            <p>Maria, the bar&#x2019;s cleaner who is an immigrant in the country illegally, is not set to return. (The Times also agreed to not use her full name because of her immigration status.) She is undergoing chemotherapy for multiple myeloma, a cancer of the plasma cells in her bone marrow. Her health declined sharply after the lockdowns began, and by May she could hardly walk. But since she began treatment, she said, she has slowly improved and is getting around with a walker. With her out of work, Kachingwe hired her husband to clean some days.</p>

            <p>Kachingwe, Santos and Maria all were aided over the past year by an unexpected source: donations from readers and listeners of The Times. After The Times published an article and a podcast about the Hatch and its staff last year, roughly $75,000 poured into the bar&#x2019;s online fundraisers. Most helped keep the bar afloat, while about $10,500 went to Maria and $260 to Santos. (Maria received far more because, unlike Santos, she was featured in a Times podcast.)</p>

    
            <p>&#x201C;Thanks to God and the people who, without knowing me, have helped me,&#x201D; Maria said in Spanish. &#x201C;Without that help, we wouldn&#x2019;t have survived.&#x201D;</p>

    
            <p>Kachingwe said the donations, as well as the $145,000 in federal money, had helped him change the business. He lobbied city officials to close down a lane of traffic and then twice built a patio in its place. (Days of rain ruined the first patio.) He and staff built the takeout window, rewrote the menu, moved a projector and screen outside, and bought an outdoor sound system off Craigslist.</p>

    
            <p>He said the Hatch was now better suited for a post-pandemic world, with more outdoor space and a takeout operation. It also suddenly has a few sister businesses.</p>

    
            <p>Easterbrook, the Hatch&#x2019;s manager, had been planning to open a sister bar called Good for Nothing, but she quickly ditched the plan when the pandemic arrived. Then, in a late-night conversation while waiting for takeout orders at the Hatch, Easterbrook, a trained florist, and Kachingwe came up with the idea for Pothead. To them, the concept made sense: There was still demand for flowers and plants, the Hatch&#x2019;s new outdoor space could attract customers, and they could use the bar&#x2019;s liquor license to sell wine.</p>

    
            <p>Easterbrook said the first weeks had been a success, though Kachingwe still had plenty to learn. &#x201C;In the beginning he asked me things like, &#x2018;Should I get more sand for the flowers?&#x2019; &#x201D; she said.</p>

    
            <p>Kachingwe teamed up with the Hatch&#x2019;s cook, Leonardo Garcia, to make and bottle sauces, including Hatch Fire Ketchup and Hatch Fuego. And he worked with Giacchino Breen, a 23-year-old bartender, on bottling cocktails under a new brand, Wolfmoon. As part of Kachingwe&#x2019;s effort to empower his employees, Garcia and Breen have stakes in the sales.</p>

    
            <p>Now, after a year in which he worried the Hatch would never fully open again, Kachingwe said his biggest anxiety was welcoming customers back inside. He is trying to figure out how to make the sound system cover both the indoor and outdoor spaces and whether to have indoor customers order food at the outdoor window. Until they receive a vaccine, some on the staff are also uncomfortable with customers returning inside the compact bar.</p>

    
            <p>In fact, Kachingwe said, he prefers the new Hatch to what it was before the pandemic. With the outdoor seating, &#x201C;it&#x2019;s more lively,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t see things going back to the way they were.&#x201D;</p>

            <p>A Texas restaurant owner publicly opposed Governor Greg Abbott&apos;s decision to lift the state mask mandate &#x2014; and his place of business suffered for it.</p>

    
            <p>Mike Nguyen, owner of The Noodle Tree ramen restaurant in San Antonio, called the governor&apos;s decision &quot;selfish&quot; during a CNN interview.</p>

    <div id="paywall" class="content-wrapper">
            <p>&quot;I will say that the governor doesn&apos;t have us Texans&apos; [best] interest at play at this point,&quot; said Nguyen. &quot;I think it&apos;s more of a personal interest, I think the decision to drop the mask mandate is selfish and cowardly and there&apos;s no reason to do it. Dropping the mask mandate will not help the economy, it will not help us open and a lot of us feel that he&apos;s putting a lot of us in danger.&quot;</p>

            <p>A few days later Nguyne&apos;s business was vandalized with racist graffiti, according to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/kung-flu-texas-ramen-eatery-covered-racist-graffiti-after-owner-opposed-lifting-mask-mandate-1576059">Newsweek&apos;s Christina Zhao</a>.</p>

    
            <p>Photos shared to Facebook by Elder Eats KSAT 12 showed graffiti covering the windows of the restaurant that included the words, &quot;No Mask,&quot; &quot;Kung Flu,&quot; &quot;Commie,&quot; &quot;Hope U Die&quot; and &quot;Ramen Noodle Flu.&quot;</p>

            <p>Following his CNN interview, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/noodletreetx/posts/1349379018794563">Nyugen shared in a Facebook post</a> that&#xA0;he had some hesitation because of the potential backlash he could face, but his words needed to be said.</p>

            <p>&quot;We are Texans and what we do especially in San Antonio is have each others back during times of need. We do the right thing,&quot; Nguyen wrote in a post. &quot;Our governor has betrayed us but that doesn&apos;t mean we have to follow him blindly. ...We can stand United and do what&apos;s right because we are Texan, we are Texas y&apos;all.&quot;</p>
