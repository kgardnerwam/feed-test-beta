			<p>The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine, perhaps more than any other COVID shot, knows what it is to be bullied by the American public. Since the spring, the shot’s been roasted, and roasted, and roasted again—first for its late arrival and its

				<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.10.21264827v2">maybe try Moderna this time?</a>)—rendering the vaccine’s one-and-done protection, its clearest advantage over its mRNA competitors, just about moot. The underdog dose, the “<a href="https://abc11.com/johnson-and-vaccine-covid-pfizer/10379441/">second class</a>” shot, the nation’s vaccine-a non grata, seemed as good as dead.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>This incessant ragging has been all too easy—and maybe shortsighted. According to some experts, the haters are overlooking a trait that could rescue J&amp;amp;J’s reputation, and possibly even keep it in scientific contention. “I think there is a
				silver lining to this vaccine that a lot of people don’t see,” David Martinez, an immunologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who is studying immune responses to COVID-19 shots, told me. It’s a trait called durability—the ability
				of a vaccine’s protection to persist, despite the ravages of time.

				with the shot. “It’s unequivocal,” Mathai Mammen, the global head of research and development for Janssen, the vaccine-manufacturing pharmaceutical company owned by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, told me. In tracking the vaccine’s effectiveness, “there
				is no change, month over month over month.” The shot’s initial

				of protection against sickness
				<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.21264595v1.full.pdf">might not match Moderna’s or Pfizer’s</a>. But after they’re built, J&amp;amp;J’s defenses seem to stick around in a way that their mRNA-driven counterparts
				<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.21264595v1.full.pdf">might not</a>, like a low-wattage bulb that keeps burning, long after all the other lights in the room have flickered and died.</p>

			<p>
				<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm0620">Not everyone</a>

				<a href="https://view-hub.org/covid-19/effectiveness-studies">ready</a>

				<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.08.21264595v1">laud J&amp;amp;J’s staying power</a>; we are, after all, still very early on in our relationship with these vaccines, and our understanding of their traits will keep evolving. But even the
				<em>potential
				</em>for tenacity, in a vaccine, has real appeal. A durable shot is low-maintenance, requiring only rare checkups or boosters; it can be delivered once or twice or thrice and, in the best-case scenario, never, ever again. As the pandemic heads into
				its third year, durability underpins some of the biggest open questions in COVID immunology—the long-term outlook for our current shots, the number we’ll ultimately need, and the possibility of engineering an even sturdier vaccine. A lack of
				durability might mean we’ll be getting COVID shots
				<em>often,
				</em>maybe even annually. Or, if we can figure out a clever way to give out shots now, we may not have to administer them again. A vaccine’s value isn’t just in its peak performance; also essential to know is when, and how quickly, protection might
				start to decline.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But the quest for durability has long been thorny. Several experts I spoke with described it as one of the most elusive concepts in vaccinology, an immunological white whale that researchers frequently chase but almost never catch. “We don’t have
				<em>one right answer</em>” for what makes a vaccine’s protection stick, Padmini Pillai, an immunologist at MIT, told me. “It’s always
				<em>it depends</em>.” As long as the virus continues to
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/omicron-coronavirus-variant-what-we-know/620827/?utm_source=feed">sprout new variants</a>, and we as hosts continue to throw ourselves in its path, lasting protection may not really be in
				the cards. A vaccine that guards us doggedly, though, could cushion us against the pathogen’s constant pummeling. In a world without guarantees, we need a vaccine that doesn’t just punch back, but punches back reliably, again and again and again.</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>Establishing durability starts with first impressions. To offer truly long-lasting protection, a vaccine has to persuade the body to study its offering, then stably store that intel away. “The bottom line is, you have to convince the immune system
				that this is scary,” Mark Slifka, an immunologist and vaccine expert at Oregon Health &amp;amp; Science University, told me. When the process works well, it can work
				<em>really
				</em>well. Every time a microbe returns to trouble us, the defenses we mount against it get
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/anatomy-of-a-vaccine-breakthrough/619562/?utm_source=feed">stronger, faster, more precise</a>; the response becomes a reflex, built on the memories of immune cells that have thwarted the same threat before.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>The major players in
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/waning-immunity-not-crisis-right-now/619965/?utm_source=feed">immune memory</a>
				fall into two main camps, headlined by B cells and T cells. B cells are weapons manufacturers, tasked with pumping out microbe-trouncing antibodies; T cells are single-combat assassins that home in on infected cells and force them to self-destruct.
				Both Bs and Ts will show up to fight most infections of note, cloning themselves into complementary armies. As the danger passes, their numbers contract, leaving behind only a so-called memory contingent—dormant Bs and Ts that holster the
				<em>capacity
				</em>for protection, like sleeper agents waiting to hear a trigger phrase. And finding relatively sturdy levels of these cells and the molecules they make is a
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/correlates-of-protection-vaccine-immunity/619508/?utm_source=feed">decent proxy</a>
				for judging immunity’s longevity. High levels of antibodies and B cells that recognize the viruses responsible for
				<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006601">smallpox and measles</a>, for instance, have been found in people
				<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa066092">
					<em>decades</em>
				</a>
				after they received those two very potent vaccines.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>When investing resources, though, our immune systems must be stingy. Not every potential threat they encounter gets locked in the body’s defensive memory. Generally speaking, they’ll devote more storage space to bugs they deem dangerous repeat
				offenders. Many durable vaccines, then, are really annoying ones, pestering cells so much that they have little choice
				<em>but
				</em>to remember what’s up.</p>

				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/sterilizing-immunity-myth-covid-19-vaccines/620023/?utm_source=feed">Read: We’re asking the impossible of vaccines</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>One decent approach to making a vexing vaccine involves a weakened version of the bona fide pathogen. The
				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html">measles vaccine</a>, for example, contains a neutered virus—one that won’t cause true measles, but is otherwise a dead ringer that bops through the body, infiltrating cells and copying
				itself in much the same way its scarier cousin would. This approach isn’t foolproof: Manufacturing vaccines like these can be slow and difficult, and the payoff doesn’t always come through. Shot-induced defenses against mumps, for instance, seem to
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6414234/">slowly</a>
				<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.aao5945">ebb</a>
				over time. And toying around with vaccines that still replicate can be dangerous. The tamed virus in the
				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/polio/hcp/vaccine-derived-poliovirus-faq.html">oral polio vaccine</a>
				can, in very rare cases, acquire mutations that allow it to cause full-blown disease.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>To ratchet down risk, researchers will sometimes opt instead for
				<em>killed
				</em>microbes—completely incapable of causing harm, but still very much recognizable as the real thing. This strategy is akin to giving the immune system target practice with a corpse, and can be very, well, hit or miss. Our most used flu vaccine,
				for instance, is of this ilk, but offers only modest protection that appears to
				<a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/73/4/726/6104243">atrophy</a>
				just
				<em>months</em>
				after people get their shot. Still other tactics simplify things further, and use only select pieces (often proteins) of a pathogen’s anatomy. The idea here is to teach immune cells about the bug’s most salient or dangerous features, in hopes of
				coaxing out a hyper-precise, hyper-potent attack. These vaccines are especially safe, and easy to mass-produce. But there’s always the risk that they fixate on the wrong microbial feature, especially if it’s one
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/spike-protein-vaccines-covid/618954/?utm_source=feed">easily modified through mutation</a>. Many of these limited-focus shots have also, over the years, delivered lackluster results because they poorly
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3529748/">titillate T cells</a>. By themselves, “proteins just aren’t irritating cells that much,” and sometimes, vaccine makers have to add other ingredients just to rouse immune cells into
				reacting, Sallie Permar, a pediatrician and vaccinologist at Cornell, told me. Protection offered by the protein-based
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5710106/">pertussis vaccine</a>, for instance, is
				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/about/faqs.html#:~:text=CDC%20estimates%20that%20in%20the,4%20years%20after%20getting%20Tdap.">infamously brittle</a>.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Common vaccine lore holds that some in this last class of vaccines might be
				<em>too
				</em>unlike the bugs they’re modeled on; the immune system has a hard time appreciating what they represent. After all, loose jumbles of free-floating protein are, architecturally, nothing like the intricately patterned pathogens they’re meant to
				teach immune cells about. For someone who’s never seen a flower, a pile of petals is not enough to form a picture; first,
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6504826/">the petals have to be arranged</a>.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In this way, the very unusual shape of the HPV vaccine makes it an outlier among its colleagues. This shot contains
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6035892/">viruslike particles</a>—hollow shells, ornamented with a tight array of HPV proteins. The particles aren’t themselves infectious, but they seem to do a heck of a job eliciting a
				persistent antibody response. After just two doses of the vaccine, levels lift, then dip down to a startlingly stable plateau, thanks to a small armada of B cells in the bone marrow that continues to churn out antibodies. The HPV shot “has become the
				poster child of durability,” John Schiller, whose discoveries helped develop the vaccine, told me. Its recipients seem to retain a shield against the virus that is, as far as researchers can tell, as close to impermeable as one can get. If Schiller
				were to take a stab at designing a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, he said, “I would do virus-like particles.”</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>The future of COVID-19 vaccines could include some of these
				<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01370-1">flashier</a>,
				<a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(21)01062-X">virus-mimicking models</a>. For now, though, our best shots are the ones we already have. The Moderna, Pfizer, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson varieties seem to sit somewhere in the
				middle of the spectrum of immunological irk. Like protein vaccines, they serve up only chunks of the virus, but part of their innovation is that they don’t offer those tidbits directly. Instead, the vaccines instruct
				<em>our
				</em>cells to manufacture SARS-CoV-2’s spike, a protein that normally decorates the virus’s surface, and parade those spikes in front of immune cells, partially simulating an infection. In J&amp;amp;J’s case, the comparison to infection is
				particularly close. The vaccine contains a different virus, called an adenovirus, that pushes into cells and delivers its protective payload. It’s modified to be benign, but it’s still, to the immune system, a
				<em>virus</em>. That might be why
				<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2115596">some</a>
				<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2108829">studies</a>
				have found that the J&amp;amp;J shot is especially good at tickling certain types of T cells, which prefer to take their lessons from vaccines that will pantomime infected cells.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>That’s not to say the mRNA vaccines are T-cell slouches. The post-shot T-cell counts for all three vaccines are respectable, and their levels all
				<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34671780/">look quite stable, several months out</a>. There’s also now strong evidence that
				<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03738-2">great numbers of B cells</a>
				will post up in the blood and the
				<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34751268/">bone marrow</a>
				<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abm0829">after COVID vaccination</a>, some of them retaining the ability to
				<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2103916">eke out antibodies</a>
				long-term, even
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/waning-immunity-not-all-bad/620436/?utm_source=feed">sharpening their sniperlike skills against SARS-CoV-2</a>. Those forces are a big part of why “the level of protection against severe
				disease is still very good” with all three brands, Kizzmekia Corbett, an immunologist at Harvard who helped develop Moderna’s vaccine, told me. And sustained protection against severe disease certainly counts as a type of durability.</p>

			</p>
			<p>When defenses drop, though, they tend to do so stepwise: The strongholds against infection fall first, then transmission, then serious disease, and finally death.

				<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.28.21264260v2">transmission</a>, gradually but notably ebbs in the months after people are inoculated. Some of that dip is probably attributable to<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2108891">
					fast-spreading, slightly immune-evasive Delta</a>, and the world’s growing ennui with distancing and

				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/coronavirus-evolution-vaccines/619875/?utm_source=feed">new variant</a>
				like Omicron rises, we could be due for yet another trough in protection. But decreasing effectiveness could also reflect our bodies’ reaction to the shots. Antibodies seem to be tied tightly to protection thresholds, and “we’re quickly seeing
				antibody levels fall” in the months after people get their Pfizer and Moderna shots, Ai-ris Yonekura Collier, a physician and immunologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, in Boston, who’s been
				<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2115596">studying immune responses to COVID-19 shots</a>, told me.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>That in and of itself isn’t catastrophic—antibodies
				<em>always
				</em>contract after the first flush of infection or vaccination—but the slope is steeper than some researchers would like. In a small, recent study, Collier and her colleagues showed that about eight months post-vaccination, virus-blocking antibodies
				are down roughly 40-fold from their peak, and it’s not clear when or where the downslope will flatten into a plateau. Perhaps the molecules have already settled at a stable level, with safeguards against severe disease strong, and defenses against
				milder outcomes middling. Or maybe they’ve still got a ways to fall. “It’s normal to see rapid decay,” Slifka told me. “The question is, how high above the protective threshold do you land?”</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/mix-match-booster-covid-vaccine/620395/?utm_source=feed">Read: Should you mix and match your booster shot?</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>It’s still early, but Collier thinks the dynamics might look a bit different for people who got a single dose of J&amp;amp;J. Her recent work shows that their antibody levels start significantly lower than mRNA recipients’, but that eight months
				out from vaccination, the numbers have stayed stable, and have, perhaps, even gone up, shrinking some of the gap between brands. “I liken them to a fine wine,” Collier told me. “They get better over time.” Still, antibodies aren’t everything.
				J&amp;amp;J’s success might come down to how those antibody levels behave further out, and how the rest of the immune system behaves in concert.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With only months of data to back the J&amp;amp;J shots, “the jury’s still out” on how long their strongest effects will last us, Slifka said. For now, though, he isn’t betting that
				<em>any</em>
				of our current COVID vaccines will be immortalized in the durability hall of fame.</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>A strong shot design might jump-start durability, but even less-than-triggering recipes aren’t doomed to fail durability tests. The
				<em>how</em>,<em>
					when</em>,<em>
					how often</em>, and
				<em>how much
				</em>of administration can also cement protection. Those gentle hacks are what we’re all obsessing over now, with COVID-19: how many shots we’ll need, and how far apart.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>True staying power almost always requires more than one dose;
				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html">most shots</a>
				need to usher in multiple immunological reminders to really get the message to stick. The HPV vaccine and the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) shot are two-dosers; the vaccines that block hepatitis B use three shots; the diphtheria/tetanus/acellular
				pertussis (DTaP) vaccine uses
				<em>five</em>, and that’s all before boosts. “It can make a huge difference,” Slifka said. “The immune system thinks,
				<em>I must not have dedicated enough of an immune response to it the first time.</em>” Each additional injection tends to have a nice effect on the strength of the response, pushing B and T cells to be far feistier than they were before. No clear-cut
				logic dictates how many refreshers a vaccine regimen will need. Some shots have added doses over the years, while
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171234/">others</a>
				have
				<a href="https://immunize.nc.gov/providers/ncip/pdf/hpv_recommendations.pdf">stripped them away</a>. Researchers around the world are still debating how often we need boosters for the shots we use to block mumps (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29563321/">more often?</a>), tetanus (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2006601">less often?</a>), and yellow fever (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(19)30411-6/fulltext">depends</a>
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771278/">whom</a>
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5171234/">you ask</a>). “And every time we start to look at different pathogens, the rules can change a little bit,” UNC’s David Martinez told me.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>With COVID, the math remains extra muddy, but might fit the pattern of more is more,
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/pfizer-moderna-dose-which-vaccine-best/620501/?utm_source=feed">as my colleague Rachel Gutman has written</a>. Moderna and Pfizer are both double-dose vaccines, a one-two punch that seems to
				land better than J&amp;amp;J’s single jab. The second injections, in particular, send antibody levels soaring. The higher that early-post-vax peak crests, the more those antibodies can accomplish: They’ll be able to rally against variants they
				weren’t initially roused to spot. And their level will have more room and time to fall before it dips past the point of protecting against infection, disease, or death, “even if it’s decaying at the same rate,” Diane Griffin, an immunologist and
				measles-vaccine expert at Johns Hopkins, told me. Post-Moderna antibodies in particular surged up so high that, despite some declines, effectiveness still looks substantial, many months out; immunity-dodging variants, too, keep falling prey. The
				Moderna moxie might be due to how much viruslike stuff is
				<em>in
				</em>each dose as well. Each shot pumps in more than three times the mRNA that Pfizer’s does, perhaps scandalizing B cells into squeezing more antibodies out.</p>

			</p>
			<p>The antibodies lured out by the single J&amp;amp;J jab are, in comparison, not much to brag about. Adding a second J&amp;amp;J dose two months after the first, though,
				<a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-real-world-evidence-and-phase-3-data-confirming-strong-and-long-lasting-protection-of-single-shot-covid-19-vaccine-in-the-u-s">offers a substantial bump</a>, and a concomitant skyrocketing in
				effectiveness: 94 percent against moderate to severe COVID-19, compared with just 74 percent from the solo shot, at least among Americans. That puts J&amp;amp;J roughly on par with the mRNA vaccines in their early days. If those extra-elevated
				antibody levels hold, J&amp;amp;J could end up being a vaccination dark horse.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Timing, too, can help a vaccine’s protection cling. Moderna’s vaccine, whose two doses are delivered four weeks apart—a week longer than the Pfizer interval—appears to be the more obstinate of the mRNA duo. Other multidose vaccines are doled out
				over months or years, which might make for a better learning experience, allowing immune cells to mull a vaccine’s contents, rather than frantically skim through them. Early data on COVID-19 vaccines back this up: Waiting to give the second dose
				seems to drive an
				<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.25.21262569v1">even heftier antibody response</a>
				for all three vaccines.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>And then there’s the question of location—where vaccines are administered, and where their ingredients end up. A shot in the arm can be a big mismatch for a microbe that enters through the gut or airway, where specialized immune cells might better
				respond to a vaccine that’s
				<a href="https://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/qa_production_control_pq_11july2012.pdf">swallowed</a>
				or
				<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/nasalspray.htm">sprayed into the nose</a>. Vaccines that vanish from the body too quickly can also be forgettable. “The mRNA vaccines are a quick show” and might not give the immune system much time to wise
				up, MIT’s Padmini Pillai told me. The HPV vaccine, by contrast, might owe some of its success to the prolonged study session it delivers to cells, according to Schiller. Some experts suspect that the J&amp;amp;J shot might also smolder slowly, giving
				cells more time to sharpen their skills.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>There’s likely still room to keep pushing our current COVID vaccines’ protective potential. Doses could be
				<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34735795/">spaced further apart</a>,
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/mix-match-booster-covid-vaccine/620395/?utm_source=feed">brands mixed and matched</a>. Perhaps the key is to
				<a href="https://khub.net/documents/135939561/390853656/Effectiveness+of+BNT162b2+%28Comirnaty%2C+Pfizer-BioNTech%29+COVID-19+booster+vaccine+against+covid-19+related+symptoms+in+England.docx/a366af4e-9c7f-ce86-bc58-1cb3b88e3378">boost at the appropriate time</a>, to

				<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2786096">adults</a>—probably in part by reawakening legions of antibody-producing B cells that the body has stowed away. “Boosters are kind of a way to patch durability,” Martinez told me. What we’re
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/booster-shot-better-name/620300/?utm_source=feed">now calling “boosts”</a>

			</p>
			<p>When testing the Moderna vaccine on nonhuman primates, Harvard’s Kizzmekia Corbett has seen something encouraging. When she and her colleagues boost rhesus macaques
				<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl8912">six months after their first two doses</a>, antibody levels rocket up, then mosey back down—but the peak is higher, and the slope of decline in the weeks following “is not as steep as previously.” That could be great news for us humans: Antibodies
				<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(21)00267-6/fulltext">may take much longer, after a third shot, to reach their plateau</a>. Better yet, that set point could be
				<em>higher
				</em>than before, a sign that the body’s been goaded into further invest in its SARS-CoV-2 defense. In a best-case scenario, that additional shot could be the last one we ever need. But we won’t know either way for a good while yet.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>Durability isn’t airtight. The length of time our vaccines protect us also hinges on the microbes they guard against, which could
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/omicron-coronavirus-variant-what-we-know/620827/?utm_source=feed">shapeshift out of our shots’ grasp</a>. Human behavior, too, dictates the dynamics of protection. Pathogens spread
				<em>through</em>
				us and
				<em>because of</em>
				us; the more blasé we are about exposure, the more often our defenses get battered. When a virus runs rampant, “we can’t just ask our vaccines to pick up all the slack,” Corbett told me.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>But when deployed in the right context, vaccines that are durable—really and truly durable—can completely change our relationship with a pathogen. Viruses and bacteria, starved of proper hosts, don’t circulate as much. The post-vaccination cases that
				<em>do</em>
				occur become, on average, less severe, more ephemeral, and less likely to spread, untethering
				<em>infection
				</em>from
				<em>serious disease.
				</em>We stop checking if vaccine protection is still in place, because we don’t have that much use for it anymore; the shields can fall because the attacks have stopped. For SARS-CoV-2, a pathogen that has so deeply intertwined itself with us, that
				future is a long way off. But it’s a realization of the dream of a near-perfect vaccine: one so excellent, so steadfast, that it prompts our bodies to remember, long enough that even our minds can eventually forget.</p>

			<p>When Jon Schneider watches
				<em>Saturday Night Live</em>, he doesn’t just tune into NBC at 11:30 p.m. eastern on Saturdays. He also takes notes on his laptop, and as soon as the episode ends, at about one in the morning, he goes live on his YouTube account to discuss the
				sketches for a small but dedicated following. During the week, he rewatches every sketch and tracks show-related data on a spreadsheet, including the number of appearances each cast member made.</p>
			<p>Watching
				<em>SNL
				</em>by doing more than simply watching
				<em>SNL
				</em>began as a personal project to appreciate the series on a deeper level, Schneider told me. What he does—participating in obsessive, sports-like analysis of a TV show—might sound uniquely intense, but he’s not alone. Since late 2018, he’s found a
				<a href="https://twitter.com/thesnlnetwork">community</a>
				of like-minded
				<em>SNL
				</em>superfans, including Mike Murray, who has about 85 spreadsheets and creates charts every week for each performer’s screen time. This isn’t typical fan behavior, or even superfan behavior, such as going to conventions or cosplaying as favorite
				characters. This also isn’t behavior meant to make the viewing experience more entertaining—such as playing drinking games or, in the way an audience watching the cult film
				<em>The Room
				</em>traditionally does, tossing spoons at the screen. This is work, the kind of hard-core analysis that yields beyond in-depth knowledge. Schneider and Murray can tell you when Pete Davidson said “Live from New York!” for the 16th time and when
				Mikey Day appeared in his 100th sketch. And to an average TV watcher, such activities might sound like too much work.</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/heres-how-many-episodes-of-a-new-tv-show-you-should-watch/620260/?utm_source=feed">Read: The ‘magical episode 4’ theory</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>Yet these intense TV watchers aren’t such a niche group; making leisure time productive has become a habit for many. Apps and sites such as Goodreads and Letterboxd encourage users to track and evaluate the books they read, the films they watch,
				and the music and podcasts they listen to, while those same forms of entertainment can be streamed at faster speeds. The rise of
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/how-memes-become-money/619189/?utm_source=feed">the attention economy</a>, which encourages optimizing everything a person does toward efficiency, accelerated our tendency to engage with our hobbies in a worklike, data-driven way.</p>
			<p>The coronavirus pandemic only pushed more people toward this impulse to hustle. Murray is a musician, but when gigs dwindled, he poured his energy into his
				<em>SNL
				</em>fandom, turning a pastime into a task—and practically a job. His evolution tracks with a larger shift. “During the pandemic, we doubled down … Instead of working from home, everybody was living at work,” Celeste Headlee, the author of the book
				<a href="https://bookshop.org/books/do-nothing-how-to-break-away-from-overworking-overdoing-and-underliving/9781984824752">
					<em>Do Nothing</em>
				</a>, which explores the way American culture revolves around efficiency, told me. Americans have been told “both explicitly and implicitly that we shouldn’t be wasting time,” she explained. “Anytime you’re just entertaining yourself, [like if]
				you’re just watching a movie, you’re wasting money.” Perhaps without noticing, more and more viewers have been learning to actively engage with what they watch. “This is a generation that will seek out the ability to control the settings, to change
				it, to play with it,” Neta Alexander, an assistant professor of film and media studies at Colgate University whose research focuses on viewing habits, told me.</p>
			<p>Chad Kultgen and Lizzy Pace, for instance, never thought they’d “hyperbinge” every episode of
				<em>The Bachelor</em>
				at 2x speed while taking notes. But amid the pandemic, Kultgen and Pace, both TV writers who’d been
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/bachelor-season-25/618439/?utm_source=feed">co-hosting</a>
				a
				<em>Bachelor</em>-related podcast during their downtime, saw their job opportunities fizzle out as productions shut down, so they spent far more time than usual engaging with the show. “I don’t know if we could do it if it were a circumstance other
				than when we did it, which was deep COVID,” Pace told me. Watching
				<em>The Bachelor</em>, a pastime, became an opportunity for productivity. They came up with an idea for
				<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/How-to-Win-The-Bachelor/Chad-Kultgen/9781982172947">a book</a>
				that would analyze the show statistically, and in their hyperbinge, they gathered the necessary data. Now
				<em>The Bachelor</em>, Kultgen told me, “literally is our job.”</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/bachelor-season-25/618439/?utm_source=feed">Read: When the fantasy of The Bachelor finally met reality</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>Even when the act isn’t a means to make a living, optimizing leisure time is no longer the work of an obsessed few. “We’re living in increasingly data-driven worlds,” Murray said, adding that crunching numbers, as a fan, can invite more insightful
				conversations about a show such as
				<em>SNL</em>. “Using data to predict [cast-member trajectories] is better than just asking someone who their favorite person is.” Meanwhile, Pace has been struggling with relishing her leisure time without thinking about how to make the most of it.
				She once had to remind herself not to change the playback speed while watching an episode of
				<em>The Real Housewives</em>. “I was like,
				<em>You know what, I’m going to really let myself enjoy this one</em>,” she told me. “This was a weird decision, because theoretically, it’s all leisure … but I was like,
				<em>I’m going to
				</em>really
				<em>let myself relax</em>.”</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>According to Alexander, one of the first times people altered the playback speed of recordings, they did so out of necessity. In the 1940s, she explained, children in a school for the blind
				<a href="https://sterneworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/MillsSterneAuralSpeedReading.pdf">hacked</a>
				a phonograph to play their audiobooks faster. They had to get their homework done, and audiobooks at the time involved far too much fluff.</p>
			<p>But changing speeds or turning a piece of entertainment into something resembling work isn’t really about completing assignments anymore—people aren’t listening to podcasts or watching
				<em>The Bachelor
				</em>for homework—though efficiency remains “the go-to explanation,” Alexander said. Instead, the habit affords the modern user a sense of discipline, a feeling that many people find inherently satisfying—and, in the case of those who generate some
				income from it, valuable. “Speed watching gives people the illusion that they can control temporality,” she explained. “There is the idea that I am rewiring my brain … I am improving and upgrading my own cognitive skills to be able to add time, to be
				able to put more into my day.” She relates the rise in such strategies to the way athletes eventually master a skill; the more a person practices a certain approach to whatever they’re doing, the better they get at employing it—perhaps even turning
				it into a reflex. “It’s the pleasure of just being able to train your body,” Alexander said, an analogy echoed by Kultgen, who described his and Pace’s hyperbinge of
				<em>The Bachelor</em>
				in comparable terms: “I’ve never run a marathon,” he said, “but I assume it’s kind of similar.”</p>
			<p>Some forms of programming boost this sensation more than others. Live TV such as award shows and reality series that involve competition mechanics invite the viewer to extract data—how many times a contestant on
				<em>The</em>
				<em>Bachelor
				</em>has received a group-date rose, for example, or how many trophies a film has racked up over the course of the night—and to predict winners and losers. That method of “algorithmic watching,” as Alexander put it, makes the viewer feel like a
				productive participant—a TV optimizer, if you will, rather than a mere TV watcher. Schneider certainly feels this way about
				<em>SNL</em>, as well as series like
				<em>Survivor</em>
				and
				<em>Big Brother</em>. “The television shows that I enjoy the most are the ones where there’s an extra, almost meta level to the show,” he said. “We can take ourselves out of it and then evaluate whether it works or whether it doesn’t.”</p>
			<p>Headlee has a less charitable view of this drive to optimize TV watching. She told me that when people engage with entertainment as if they’re doing work, or going further and turning it into a source of income, they’re not discovering a new way
				to process information. They’re merely finding a way to cope with the constant
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/be-more-productive/415821/?utm_source=feed">societal pressure</a>
				to be productive, which they’ve mistaken for a natural impulse. Headlee doesn’t blame them for wanting to feel more efficient; boredom can be uncomfortable. Just look at what happened amid the pandemic, she said: For those who began
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/winners-losers-work-home-remote/619181/?utm_source=feed">working remotely</a>, the line between work and play blurred further, exacerbating the instinct to use time constructively even during moments away from their desk.</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/08/oliver-burkeman-advice-time-productivity/619723/?utm_source=feed">Read: The best time-management advice is depressing but liberating</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>In other words, leisure time is beginning to seem like a waste of time. “When you’re burnt out, you’re basically in fight-or-flight mode all the time,” Headlee explained, referring to how, during lockdown,
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/what-pandemic-doing-our-brains/618221/?utm_source=feed">brain fog</a>
				and
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/burnout-medical-condition-pandemic/619321/?utm_source=feed">fatigue</a>
				crept into people’s homes. “People weren’t ready [for such a shift], and they were, not surprisingly, starting to feel super anxious. And then they started thinking,
				<em>Okay, how can I use every single minute of my time?</em>”</p>
			<p>By keeping productivity in mind as the end goal, Headlee posited, we’re perhaps misinterpreting what we watch. Artists don’t intend for their projects to be exercises in efficiency, which is why filmmakers such as Judd Apatow and Brad Bird
				<a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/judd-apatow-brad-bird-slam-netflix-playback-speeds-1202185818/">protested</a>
				Netflix’s decision to test a playback-speed-altering feature in 2019. “You’re not immersing yourself” in the story, she said. “You’re trying to get through it as quickly as possible.” Headlee experienced this firsthand when her habit of live-tweeting
				her favorite TV shows started stressing her out, rather than adding to her enjoyment. “I was turning something that I really, really like into something that I didn’t like anymore,” she said.</p>
			<p>Still, the optimizers I spoke with say that when they dissect and speed through what they watch, they’re not distracting themselves from the actual shows. In fact, all of them expressed that when they analyze a show they love in real time, they
				feel they’re paying closer attention to it than most people do. “You definitely feel like [you’re having] a more intimate experience,” said Murray, who has watched
				<em>SNL
				</em>sketches so often, he thinks he could recite entire scripts. That sensation of closeness and understanding, Alexander pointed out, has become harder to achieve amid so many distractions—and reveals why more people are trying to analyze what used
				to be passively enjoyed. “We live in a second-screen viewing culture,” she said. “Normally when we watch Netflix, we’re also on our phones, we’re also getting back to email, we’re also checking the weather, we’re also playing a video game.” Turning
				leisure time into work may seem like a heavy price to pay, but in a world with little control, delving so deeply into anything provides, perhaps, a means to seize that control back.</p>
			<p>For many superfans, that’s enough to stave off burnout—for now. “You could fly a little bit too close to the sun when it comes to doing something you love,” Schneider conceded. “But I think that so far, up until this point ... I haven’t lost the
				love for
				<em>SNL</em>.” Or for those spreadsheets.</p>

		<id>tag:theatlantic.com,2021:50-620861</id>
		<content type="html">
			<p>Last month, at the
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/scary-future-american-right-national-conservatism-conference/620746/?utm_source=feed">National Conservatism conference</a>, a gathering of hundreds of leaders and members of a movement that
				hopes to represent a new, less libertarian American right, one of the speakers, a lawyer named Josh Hammer, delivered a strange denunciation of “fusionism.” For those not steeped in the language of conservatism,
				<em>fusionism</em>
				refers to the alliance among economic conservatives, social conservatives, and defense hawks forged during the Reagan administration. It was designed to confront government overreach at home and the threat of Soviet tyranny abroad.</p>
			<p>Fusionism,
				<a href="https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-only-path-forward-is-national-conservatism/">Hammer said</a>, is “inherently effete, limp, and, as Hillsdale College’s David Azerrad
				<a href="https://americanmind.org/features/thinking-about-thinking-about-trump/trumps-manliness/">might say</a>, unmasculine.” It “makes for a cowardly way to approach politics” in part because it “ensures never having to face pushback from one’s political opponents on the most contested issues.”</p>
			<p>Longtime fusionists, who are veterans not just of the intense and consequential debates surrounding foreign policy during the Cold War and the War on Terror but also of countless successful courtroom contests designed to expand First Amendment
				rights in the face of government censorship, might be startled by this news.</p>
			<p>But that’s hardly the oddest part of Hammer’s critique. Fusionism is “unmasculine”? How is that claim a part of an allegedly serious ideological argument? The critique, however, helps illuminate the emerging culture of the right—a culture that
				idolizes a twisted version of “toughness” as the highest ideal and despises a false version of “weakness” as the lowest vice.</p>
			<p>Claims of cowardice have particular purchase among Trump’s followers.
				<em>Coward</em>
				is a one-word rebuttal that not only attempts to end an argument, but also aims to discredit the person who made it. Who wants to listen to a coward? Who wants to be known as a coward?</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/donald-trump-the-most-unmanly-president/612031/?utm_source=feed">Tom Nichols: Donald Trump, the most unmanly president</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>What makes the claims of toughness and weakness especially curious and dangerous is the way in which they’re tied to the person of Donald Trump. Although “toughness” has long been a populist virtue—especially in the South—the age of Trump
				transformed the right’s definitions of
				<em>strength</em>
				and
				<em>courage</em>
				by reference to the man himself. And what are Trump’s alleged strong, masculine virtues?</p>
			<p>In the Azerrad essay that Hammer cited, Azerrad explains that Trump’s strength is “not that of a soldier who risks his life in combat or of a general who leads men into battle.” (Trump used an alleged diagnosis of bone spurs to avoid the draft
				during the Vietnam War.) So in that sense, Trump “isn’t as manly as” General Jim Mattis, Azerrad concedes. But Trump is more manly than Mattis in a different way, he explains: “Trump’s manliness is that of a man who is not afraid to say out loud what
				others only whisper and to incur the wrath of the ruling class for doing so.”</p>
			<p>This is a curious definition of
				<em>manliness</em>. Saying what you think or what others seem afraid to say isn’t inherently “manly.” Speaking your mind isn’t even inherently virtuous, much less inherently masculine. Trump has said many false and harmful things, and the fact that
				other people might whisper them does not mean that they should be shouted from the presidential bully pulpit.</p>
			<p>When Trump’s supporters claim that he is tough and manly, though, they’re often also trying to flatter themselves by implying that they share his virtues. In an
				<a href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2021/01/73675/">apology written to Never Trumpers</a>
				after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the evangelical intellectual Hunter Baker expressed a common view. Never Trumpers, he said, “struck me as psychologically and emotionally weak people with porcelain-fragile sensibilities.”</p>
			<p>The weakness/strength dichotomy works as shield and sword. Any critique of Trump, Trumpism, or the new right can be dismissed as evidence of mere cowardice or fragility. The Never Trumpers and classical liberals aren’t strong enough for the fight,
				the new right tells itself. Rather than doing what it takes to stand against the left, they retreat to the shelter of “elite” spaces, where the left welcomes them with open arms.</p>
			<p>And what of the “strength” of Trumpism? Because the movement is centered on and modeled after Trump himself, many of these displays of “strength” are deliberately cruel (see, for example, Adam Serwer’s seminal essay, “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/?utm_source=feed">The Cruelty Is the Point</a>”) and deliberately defy moral norms. Indeed, the cruelty itself is an act of defiance—decency is what “they” demand, and one cannot comply with “their” demands.</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/lawless-masculinity-gop/620732/?utm_source=feed">Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Welcome to the age of lawless masculinity</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>This defiance of moral norms means that Trumpist “toughness” was never, and could never have been, truly confined to online spaces or even to tough rhetoric. Boundaries are for the weak. So while Trump’s new-right allies and successors often treat
				Twitter as their Omaha Beach and angry tweets and vicious insults as the online equivalent of attacking a German pillbox with rifle fire and grenades, others know that becoming a keyboard warrior is hardly the highest masculine ideal.</p>
			<p>Indeed, the logic of the movement presses toward direct action. If you tell enough people that the future of the country is at stake, that their political opponents have corrupted democracy, and that only the truly tough have what it takes to save
				the nation, then speeches about unmanly ideologies will never be enough. Trolling on Twitter will, ironically, come to look like a hollow remedy, itself a form of weakness.</p>
			<p>Thus we see the increased prevalence of open-carried AR-15s at public protests, the increased number of unlawful threats hurled at political opponents, and outbreaks of actual political violence, including the large-scale violence of January 6.</p>
			<p>One of the most dangerous developments in our contentious times has been a growth in radical ideologies bolstered by radical intellectuals who often treat decency and even peace as impediments to justice. The riots that ripped through American
				cities were inexcusable expressions of political fury (and sometimes pure nihilism) that were too often rationalized, excused, and sometimes even celebrated. The author and academic Freddie deBoer has

				a depressing list of articles, essays, and interviews in prominent publications excusing and justifying violent civil unrest.</p>
			<p>The right-wing cult of toughness, in its distinctly Trumpist version, is no exception to this trend. When it is drained of limiting principles and tied to a man who would rather seek to upend our nation’s constitutional order than relinquish
				power, then the threat to the republic is plain. That threat will remain until the supposedly weak classical liberals on the left and the right do what they’ve always done at their best—rally in defense of liberty, the rule of law, and the American
				order itself.</p>

			<p class="dropcap">F<span class="smallcaps">ew Saudi officials</span>
				are more candid or colorful these days than Prince Turki al-Faisal, a son of the late King Faisal and former ambassador to Washington. Although he no longer holds a government position, the prince retains influence and insight into the kingdom and,
				thanks to a two-decade-long career as Riyadh’s intelligence chief, understands better than anyone its rivalry with Iran. So I was mildly surprised by his frank assessment of the current state of affairs. “The Iranians,” he told me, “have us by the
				cojones.” (He was speaking in a private setting and later assured me that I could quote him.)</p>
			<p>The kingdom should feel secure enough in the face of an adversary strangled by sanctions, whose economy is less than a third the size of its own, whose military budget is less than a quarter of the kingdom’s, and whose oil production is at an
				all-time low. And yet, anxiety within Saudi Arabia, a Sunni Arab monarchy, vis-à-vis Iran, a Shiite Persian theocracy, has been a constant over the past few decades, and not without reason.</p>
			<p>Iranian officials have been boasting for years that they control four Arab capitals: Beirut, Damascus, Sanaa, and Baghdad. Across these countries, Tehran runs a network of militias through which it projects power, siphons off local resources, and
				forms a ring of fire that essentially encircles Saudi Arabia. Iran’s cheaper, asymmetrical approach to warfare gives it an advantage over its richer Gulf neighbors with well-armed but less experienced traditional forces. Add to that a nuclear program
				that is progressing apace, and Prince Turki is indeed right. Or at least he would have been until very recently because subtle but serious shifts in the Middle East are making Iran feel insecure and cornered. That, paradoxically, is why Tehran is
				acting overconfidently and being uncompromising, all of which makes for a dangerous combination.</p>
			<p>Let’s start with Iran’s nuclear program. Tehran had hoped that Joe Biden’s presidency would herald an easy and quick return to the nuclear agreement that Donald Trump pulled out of, and with it would come the lifting of sanctions. But the Biden
				administration has been more intransigent than the Iranians expected. Almost a year after Biden took office, no relief is in sight for Iran’s economy. It contracted by 7 percent from 2019 to 2020, and the national currency has taken a plunge. Iran’s
				oil exports rose to 2.5
				<a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/content/analysis/countries_long/Iran/pdf/iran_exe.pdf">million</a>
				barrels a day in 2016, after the nuclear deal came into effect, then dropped to 400,000 barrels a day under Trump. Under Biden, oil exports have inched up, but barely, and the country’s reserves have strengthened only thanks to rising oil prices.
				Under Trump, Iran lost access to more than $100 billion of its foreign reserves; so far under Biden, they remain off limits, in bank accounts around the
				<a href="https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2021/nov/01/explainer-iran%E2%80%99s-frozen-assets">world</a>. Iran needs this money to stabilize its national currency, keep its economy running, and stave off protests. And yet, despite all this, Iran
				appears in no mood to compromise, continuing to fund and develop its nuclear program and regional power plays.</p>
			<p>But tighter resources are not Iran’s most serious concern. An Iranian academic based abroad, who asked to remain anonymous because he still travels regularly to Tehran, told me that although Iran is not able to spend as much as it used to on its
				regional allies and proxies (the figure is almost half of what it was in 2014, down to about $2 billion to $3 billion a year, he estimates), the real challenge facing Tehran is the rapidly changing regional landscape—which is precisely why it cannot
				compromise in nuclear talks.</p>

			</p>
			<p>First there are the ongoing Israeli
				<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-55646298">strikes</a>
				on Iranian
				<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/5-pro-iran-fighters-said-killed-in-alleged-israeli-strike-near-damascus/">military</a>

				or
				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-natanz.html">nuclear</a>
				installations over the past couple years. Within Syria, Iran also has to cooperate and sometimes compete with the mightier Russian military, which dilutes some of its power on the ground.</p>
			<p>More confounding was the outburst of
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/qassem-soleimani-death-missed/604396/?utm_source=feed">popular</a>
				anger in Beirut and Baghdad in the fall of 2019 against corruption and sectarianism, which also targeted Iranian influence and Tehran’s proxy militias in both countries. Iran’s involvement in Lebanon and Iraq has brought no economic benefits to those
				countries’ populations, except for Tehran’s closest allies or a corrupt few. Meanwhile both countries sink into a state of economic disrepair. Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran analyst at the Carnegie Endowment (where I am a nonresident fellow), describes
				this dynamic as an “axis of misery.” The 2019 protests happened while Iranians themselves were out marching against their government; taken together, the various movements were among the more complex challenges that Qassem
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/01/qassem-soleimani-death-missed/604396/?utm_source=feed">Soleimani</a>, the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force, had to face in his career. The Iranians were concerned enough by the
				wave of discontent that Soleimani was personally involved in the violent crackdowns in all three countries, before he was killed by a U.S. strike in Iraq in January 2020.</p>
			<p>The protests have continued to simmer in Lebanon and Iraq. In the latter, the mood shift against Tehran resulted in the trouncing of Iranian allies in parliamentary elections last month. That’s not to say Iran’s influence in Iraq is being rolled
				back, but that there is a breach in its hold on the country. Barely a month after the election, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in the form of a drone attack on his residence, which
				<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/07/drone-attack-on-iraqi-pms-home-marks-escalation-in-power-struggle">U.S.</a>
				and
				<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/nov/07/drone-attack-on-iraqi-pms-home-marks-escalation-in-power-struggle">Iraqi</a>
				officials blamed on pro-Iran militias. Whether Iran ordered the attack is almost irrelevant—if it did, the move denotes anger and insecurity; if it didn’t, the assassination attempt indicates the loosening of its control over the militias.</p>
			<p>In Lebanon, protesters chanted slogans against the Iran-backed party-cum-militia Hezbollah and its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, for the first time, including in some of the cities where the group is most powerful. An
				<a href="about:blank">investigation</a>
				into last year’s Beirut port blast appears to be making Hezbollah uneasy. This summer, a series of incidents saw members of Hezbollah clash with people from different religious communities in various locations and, in a country with too many guns, at
				least two members of the Shiite group were shot
				<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/three-dead-ambush-shiite-mourners-south-beirut-hezbollah-source-2021-08-01/">dead</a>—signaling that its aura of invincibility has taken a hit. Opposition groups in Lebanon are hoping to replicate
				some of the success witnessed in Iraq to claw parliamentary seats away from Hezbollah and its allies during next year’s elections. Here again, while popular discontent is real and Iran is learning that domination through oppression and
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/05/arab-spring-democracy-protest/618774/?utm_source=feed">assassinations</a>
				is never-ending hard work, Tehran will continue to deploy all tools, including violence, to maintain its grip.</p>
			<p>So can the popular pushback against Iran translate into real political change? The short answer is no, at least not in a meaningful way, because there are few local mechanisms to outmaneuver Iran and its entrenched allies inside Lebanon and Iraq.</p>
			<p class="dropcap">T<span class="smallcaps">his brings us</span>
				to the regional dynamics and the Biden administration. The past few months have been an interesting multidimensional chess game across the Middle East: Iraq hosted talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran; the United Arab Emirates foreign minister visited
				Damascus; Jordan and Egypt drew up proposals to help address Lebanon’s energy crisis; Jordan, Israel, and the UAE signed a separate
				<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-jordan-sign-uae-brokered-deal-to-swap-solar-energy-and-water/">energy</a>
				deal; and much else besides. This is more regional activity, mostly cooperative, than the Middle East has seen in years.</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/09/us-china-middle-east/619977/?utm_source=feed">Read: How America can win the Middle East</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>It’s easy to overinterpret the intentions behind such moves or how much strategic thinking is involved. But three parallel patterns have emerged, all of which should worry Tehran.</p>
			<p>First, the efforts to engage with Iran to de-escalate tensions appear to be mostly pro forma, including by the Saudis. The kingdom’s foreign minister
				<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/8665b1d2-b0ca-4dd0-8a18-837e3ad5b110">described</a>
				the talks in Baghdad as “cordial” and “exploratory,” while another official said the dialogue lacked substance. A high-level delegation from the UAE is expected to travel to Tehran in the coming weeks. No one expects decades of rivalry and enmity to
				end, and there’s no sign yet that Tehran is offering enough to Riyadh for it to reopen the Saudi embassy in Iran. Regional engagement with Iran can help reduce tensions while the high-stakes nuclear talks inch forward. At the very least, Arab
				countries can turn to the U.S. and say, in effect: “We have engaged; we’ve been positive; we got nothing.”</p>
			<p>Second, nothing has served Iran’s interests better in past years than division among and dysfunction within Arab countries. Petulant moves such as Riyadh’s brief kidnapping of Lebanon’s prime minister in 2017, or its rush into war in Yemen in
				2015, have backfired, providing opportunities for Iran to deepen its involvement in both countries. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, Saudi Arabia was a reluctant, almost absent, partner in post-Saddam Iraq, to the benefit of Iran. Now Arab
				countries appear to be working together on an ad hoc basis to address regional energy issues; even Saudi Arabia is discussing deals worth billions of dollars with Iraq. Two years ago, a senior Saudi official told me that the best way to counter Iran
				would be with an economic vision for the region.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, decades into a chilly peace between Israel and its neighbors Jordan and Egypt, several Gulf countries have signed peace treaties with Israel, a set of agreements known collectively as the Abraham Accords, and the evolution of the
				public relationship and cooperation between Israel and the UAE has been particularly swift. The agreements have done little to help the Palestinians and played into Iran’s decades-long propaganda efforts to brand itself as the only real defender of
				the Palestinian cause. But the Accords also present a true
				<a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/09/14/israels-peace-deals-are-a-strategic-nightmare-for-iran/">strategic</a>
				challenge for Tehran, which now faces a front of Arab countries actively working with Israel.</p>
			<p>Finally, there are the overtures to the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad by Jordan and the UAE—pragmatic realpolitik at its best, or perhaps worst. Assad should be facing trial at the International Criminal Court for war crimes and genocide, but 10
				years after the start of the peaceful uprising turned bloody civil war in Syria—in which an overwhelming majority of casualties were the result of government shelling, with Russian help later on—Assad is clearly not going anywhere.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, Jordan’s economy has taken a real hit over the past decade because of the closing of borders, the choking off of trade, and the flood of incoming refugees. Jordan’s imperatives for reaching out to Assad are different from the UAE’s, but
				both see an advantage in diluting Iran’s presence in Syria even slightly. (Trying to peel Syria away from Iran has been a longtime dream of many, including the George W. Bush administration, but ties have run deep between
				<a href="https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/iran-news/iran-is-not-leaving-syria-anytime-soon-685436">Damascus</a>
				and Tehran since the early days of the Iranian revolution.) Even a diplomatic spat between Riyadh and Beirut a few weeks ago appears to have been the result of a convoluted effort by the kingdom to gain leverage in Lebanon again, after it ceded
				ground to Iran in prior years. In other words, Arab countries are signaling to Tehran that it is no longer the only player in Iraq, Lebanon, and Syria. (Yemen is a different problem.)</p>
			<p>All of this regional activity is happening with the U.S. quietly coordinating in the background, encouraging some moves while discouraging or ignoring others (such as the overtures to Assad), but overall engaging in much more
				<a href="https://www.axios.com/special-envoy-visits-middle-east-iran-deal-973d4368-8963-4d95-9ae3-5694b37e3a26.html">diplomacy</a>
				across the region ahead of the nuclear talks with Iran that
				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/world/europe/iran-sanctions-nuclear-talks.html">resumed this week</a>
				after a five-month hiatus.</p>
			<p>Crisis is always around the corner in the Middle East, and if the nuclear negotiations with Iran go nowhere, tensions will rise again rapidly. This is where the unusual level of inter-Arab dialogue and efforts at cooperation could provide some
				balance, and a rare win-win for everyone. Except the leaders of Iran.</p>

			<p>It was Madonna who first introduced me to Stephen Sondheim, which sounds infinitely more chic than what happened in reality: Someone gave a 7-year-old girl a cassette of
				<em>I’m Breathless</em>, the 1990 album Madonna recorded during her gauzy showgirl period, pegged to her role as Breathless Mahoney in the movie adaptation of
				<em>Dick Tracy.
				</em>At the time,
				<em>Cats</em>
				had been running on Broadway for eight years. I had recently furthered my own artistic evolution by playing the title role in our class production of
				<em>Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.
				</em>Musical theater in London was largely defined by plasticized melodies, Schönberg and Boublil, and soap-opera stars grinning out from West End billboards.</p>
			<p>But lurking within
				<em>I’m Breathless</em>—among dubious Carmen Miranda impersonations (“I’m Going Bananas”) and odes to light S&amp;amp;M (“Hanky Panky”)—were three works written by Sondheim. The film’s director and star, Warren Beatty, had asked the composer and
				lyricist to contribute five original songs, three of which made it onto the album. They vary drastically in style. “More” is a jaunty anthem to avarice that’s also a tricky retooling of lyrics cribbed from the Great American Songbook. “Sooner or
				Later” is a smoky ballad that expresses both Breathless’s sexual fixation on Dick Tracy and Tracy’s charged compulsion to lock up his criminal nemesis. “What Can You Lose?,” a duet between Madonna and the frequent Sondheim collaborator Mandy
				Patinkin, is a torch song about bottling up unrequited love. All three works are, in their way, expressions of yearning, the profound emotional core of Sondheim’s work. Given a relatively simple assignment—<em>write some songs for a comic-book movie!</em>—Sondheim delivered a puzzle disguised as pastiche, an Oscar-winning theme song that complicates the rigid masculinity of an American icon, and a
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=519p-Ei6vHY">heartbreakingly circular expedition</a>
				through romantic hope, doubt, and repression that occupies a mere two minutes.</p>
			<p>With his songs for
				<em>Dick Tracy,
				</em>Sondheim, who
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/stephen-sondheim-knew-truth-about-happy-endings/620828/?utm_source=feed">died on Friday</a>, did what he did throughout his career: engaged with a traditional discipline while simultaneously cracking it open from within. He was
				<em>the</em>
				modernist of musical theater, turning a comfortably staid genre into a knotty, disaffected, aching form of experimentation. He made the musical new. He brought a mathematician’s mind to the business of lyricism, confronting each song as a conundrum
				of marrying emotional clarity with melodic emphasis and the structural limitations of rhyme. But, crucially, he also made art for outsiders, which is why his most devoted fans tend to be artists. Sondheim’s work takes the typically unseen—aging
				women, married couples, bystanders—and forces them into the spotlight.</p>

				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/stephen-sondheim-knew-truth-about-happy-endings/620828/sondheim?utm_source=feed">Amy Weiss-Meyer: What Stephen Sondheim knew about endings</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>Once you connect with Sondheim, you’re his forever. No one else captured love as he did—not as a prize, or as an ending, but as something fleeting, hungered for, impenetrable, or even toxic. (One of my favorite songs of his is “Unworthy of Your
				Love,” from
				<em>Assassins</em>, in which John Hinckley Jr. and Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme sing poignantly about their ardor for Jodie Foster and Charles Manson.) Starting with
				<em>Saturday Night,</em>
				his first professional musical, which he finished writing in 1954, Sondheim’s characters were people on the margins with a fierce longing to be center stage. Their desires are profound, if not always straightforward. Before Sondheim, musical theater
				was largely defined by characters whose hearts were squarely and earnestly pinned on their sleeve: “Singin’ in the Rain,” “I’m in Love With a Wonderful Guy,” “I Hate Men.” What he introduced to the genre was simple but revolutionary: subtext. His
				peers weren’t
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/07/my-fair-lady-carousel-review/563102/?utm_source=feed">Lerner</a>
				and Loewe so much as
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/12/reminder-acting-is-work/282289/?utm_source=feed">Pinter</a>
				and Albee, iconoclasts intent on a more charged engagement with the modern condition.</p>
			<p>But musical theater, midway through the 20th century, wasn’t a form characterized by innovation. Sondheim’s work often perplexed and even irritated audiences, not to mention critics, who maligned his lack of “hummable” songs and—in
				<a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1979/04/sondheims-little-deaths/">the case of John Lahr</a>—accused him of killing the exuberant, old-fashioned musical. It’s not that Sondheim doesn’t offer, in moments, pure musical catharsis—the soaring,
				emphatic crescendo of “Aren’t they a gem?” or “the grass or the stick or the dog or the light.” It’s that, as Stephen Schiff wrote in a shrewd 1993
				<em>New Yorker</em>
				profile, “Sondheim’s accompaniments are sumptuous, but they don’t allow a melody to plunk neatly into place; they don’t allow it to resolve; they don’t give it a home.” His composed works are reticent: They tantalize but hold back total
				gratification.</p>
			<p>Sondheim long resisted the idea that any of his work offered a read into his own psyche, and elements of his own identity—his sexuality, his Jewishness—are defiantly absent from his art. His songs, he
				<a href="https://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/stephen-sondheim-2013-12/">insisted</a>
				to the writer and his longtime friend Frank Rich, have “nothing to do” with him and are rather fully realized outpourings of fictional characters. At the individual level, I’d say this is true (although
				<em>Company</em>’s confirmed bachelor, Bobby, seems to have distinct shades of a man who didn’t enter a meaningful romantic relationship until his 60s). But as a whole, his work is shot through with a kind of detached but intense longing, the
				loneliness of one who knows love can’t be trusted. This duality is hard not to tie to Sondheim’s mother, an emotionally abusive woman who, he wrote, interspersed verbal beration of her son with inappropriately sexualized ploys to get his attention.
				Later in life, she wrote him a letter saying that giving birth to him was her life’s one regret. When she died in 1992, Sondheim didn’t go to her funeral.</p>
			<p>Sondheim’s strikingly bitter childhood was sweetened by circumstance: His mother was friends with the wife of Oscar Hammerstein II, and the lyricist became his champion and mentor. Without Hammerstein, Sondheim writes in
				<em>Finishing the Hat</em>, he might never have become a songwriter. And yet, with a kind of Oedipal glee, he also uses the book to distance his work from that of a man who, he proclaims, “is not my idol.” The truth, he writes, “is that in
				Hammerstein’s shows, for all their revolutionary impact, the characters are not much more than collections of characteristics—verbal tics and quirks … Refining his innovations was left to my generation.” Nevertheless, Hammerstein gave Sondheim a
				master class in both craft and work. Writing, Sondheim came to understand, wasn’t about thunderbolts of inspiration but the careful honing of techniques in service of experimentation. Though he claimed that he never cooked, he read cookery columns
				with fanatical devotion, comparing the technical details of “timing, balance, form, surface versus substance” to the alchemy of songwriting.</p>

			</figure>
			<p>It was on Hammerstein’s advice that Sondheim accepted his first major jobs as a precocious lyricist: 1957’s
				<em>West Side Story</em>, with Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Laurents, and 1959’s
				<em>Gypsy</em>, with Laurents and Jule Styne. With the former, Sondheim largely felt pigeonholed into Bernstein’s lush, romantic vision for the show, but with
				<em>Gypsy</em>, he writes in
				<em>Finishing the Hat</em>, “I came of age—lyrically, at any rate.” The characters (not least, one imagines, the monstrously narcissistic and self-deluded stage mother Rose) “were types familiar to me.” And the narrative, he felt, had more dramatic
				weight and complexity than the products of Broadway’s earlier eras. Yet
				<em>Gypsy</em>, for all its vibrant theatricality and old-fashioned grandeur, also has a decided sourness to it. That’s not a critique—more an assessment of how the show acknowledges the hustle at the heart of the American dream, the innate ugliness
				of striving and manifesting a vision.</p>
			<p>
				<em>A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</em>, the first show to feature both music and lyrics by Sondheim, was a hit in 1962 and scored six Tony Awards, including Best Musical. But it was 1970’s
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/10/rosalie-craig-and-patti-lupone-shine-in-a-gender-flipped-company/573262/?utm_source=feed">
					<em>Company</em>
				</a>
				that really outlined Sondheim’s virtuosity and variation. Devised initially with the playwright George Furth as a series of loose vignettes on the subject of romantic relationships,
				<em>Company</em>
				was formed into a show by the addition of Bobby, a single man staring down 35 while his various “good and crazy” married friends urge him to settle down despite their own states of unhappiness. Sondheim initially had no sense that the show would seem
				so unsettling to audiences. The primary elements of musical theater—humor, cheerful melodies, “I Want” anthems—are all present. But coming after the ’60s, at the tail end of the Summer of Love,
				<em>Company</em>’s defining quality, its skepticism and ambivalence toward partnership, felt too cataclysmic for some. Musicals were supposed to ratify love as a guiding ideal, not disrupt it altogether. Lurking beneath the surface of
				<em>Company</em>
				is an idea that Bobby’s ambivalence isn’t his own—that the structures holding social and romantic relationships together are destabilizing in front of the audience’s very eyes.</p>
			<p>“‘Cold,’” Sondheim writes, “is an adjective that frequently crops up in complaint about the songs I’ve written, both individually and in bulk, and it all began with
				<em>Company</em>.” The show, like most exceptional works of postmodernism, is suffused with irony and disenchantment with the tentpole narratives of Western culture. Broadway-goers more accustomed to romanticized stories of self-actualization may
				have balked, but the musical, as Schiff wrote, “felt grown-up,” perhaps for the first time. It suggested a new model for what the form could do and be.
				<em>Follies,
				</em>a devoted eulogy for the bygone days of musical theater that confronts the absurdity of its characters’ dreams in show business, was even darker and more neurotic. With every show that followed (a musical about the Westernization of Japan, a
				musical about cannibalism, a musical about sacrificing your artistic integrity, which goes backward in time), Sondheim seemed to be testing every limit he could throw himself against.</p>

			<p>Not every show was a success—the majority weren’t initially, although they came to be appreciated later—but each has its defenders and detractors.
				<em>Sunday in the Park With George</em>, a 1984 show about the painter Georges Seurat that processed some of his feelings of failure regarding 1981’s
				<em>Merrily We Roll Along</em>, is one of my favorites for the sweep of its ambition and the sharpness of its yearning amid an acknowledgment that making art is inherently isolating. But
				<em>Into the Woods</em>, a 1986 pastiche of the fairy-tale musical, seems, to me, the capstone of Sondheim’s career. It’s not the greatest of his works, or the most blazingly innovative, or even the most fun. Rather, it feels like the culmination of
				so many things that defined his craft: the challenging of archaic story forms, the acknowledgment of life’s arbitrary cruelties, the pairing of dissonant melodies with moments of striking musical purity.</p>
			<p>“Sometimes people leave you / Halfway through the wood,” the Baker’s Wife sings in the finale of
				<em>Into the Woods.</em>
				“Do not let it grieve you / No one leaves for good.” If the moment feels oddly sentimental for a writer who’s such a cockeyed realist, it’s countered by Cinderella’s version of the line in an earlier song: “Others may deceive you / You decide what’s
				good.” This essence of choice and ambiguity and convolution is what Sondheim gave to theater—the idea that there’s infinitely more contained within the tragicomedy of human experience than can ever be set to music and sung on a stage.</p>

		<content type="html">
			<p>So you’ve been scrolling through Facebook for a while—dull, dull, dull—when you hear the sound of tropical bird chatter. You glimpse a 20-something woman floating in a natural pool of water with her eyes closed, and then she starts to talk to you
				about her passion for “manifesting money” and how every little thing she’s ever wanted is now hers.
				<em>What’s this?
				</em>She’s looking out the window of an airplane, through the clouds at a mossy mountaintop; she’s scooping up sand and blowing it at the camera as if the grains were dandelion seeds; she’s biking in a white dress on a secluded path, no handlebars.
				She has more time and wealth than she knows what to do with—and so now she will pause to bathe an elephant.
				<em>Wait a minute,
				</em>you say to yourself.
				<em>Could this be
				</em>my<em>
					life too?
				</em>
			</p>
			<p>Maybe, because this video is “your invitation to experience lasting abundance” and “financial freedom” and the opportunity to travel the world, ethically, while eschewing plastic water bottles. Amelia Whelan, founder of the Breakaway Movement,
				shared it to Facebook on her company’s launch day, in the summer of 2019, when she was 25 years old. “I’ve dedicated the last 12 months of my life to this project, so I know you’ll love it,” she wrote at the time. “I invite you to join me and
				breakaway …”</p>
			<p>Doing so would cost just $33.33 a month, in exchange for access to a private Facebook group, invitations to weekly group calls, an assigned mentor, and dozens of hours of video-course materials about how to create a social-media brand, how to form
				an LLC, how to maintain a “money mindset,” and, sort of, how to sell $5,000
				<a href="https://www.enagic.com/shop/en/machines/k8.html">K8 water-ionizing machines</a>
				to your friends and followers on commission for a Japanese tech company called Enagic. (Enagic says it does not have a formal relationship with the Breakaway Movement or Whelan, beyond her being an independent distributor for the company.)</p>
			<p>Whelan, the self-made (and self-declared) millionaire at the center of the movement, grew up in a small town in New York and moved to Hawaii for college. When she first started selling water-ionizing machines for Enagic, she joined a sales
				community on Facebook but didn’t vibe with it. The group had a “very predominant male presence,” she’d later say, and its members’ approach to spending money—“they were flashing checks and they were buying Yeezys”—did not appeal to her. “I knew I was
				tired of working for corporations that did very little for the things I truly care about,” she told me when I first got in touch with her last April. So she decided to start her own Enagic group, built around those things: “holistic health,
				sustainability, and the environment.” This would be the Breakaway Movement, an expansive community with good vibes and great aesthetics, offering coursework teaching newbies how to set up effective Instagram ads and “attract” a small fortune.
				Together, they would sell more than they could sell alone, and they would make Enagic machines into something
				<em>cool</em>.</p>
			<p>By this time, Whelan had an enviable personal brand under the Instagram handle
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/saltsandandsmoothies/">@saltsandandsmoothies.</a>
				Now her look would be the movement’s look—young, blond, an even tan, well dressed in the sense that well-cut bathing suits do not come cheap. (In 2019, she posted to Facebook that she was earning “more money than every single person I know.”) The
				women she’d tag in her posts—many of whom were also part of Breakaway—starred in equally beautiful narratives on their own Instagram accounts, such as renting a
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B86hEH7pXdz/">luxury tree house</a>
				in the rainforest or
				<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DGfSQpuvj/">chartering a ship</a>
				to sail around “secret islands.” And for more than a year, the platform thrived. As the company started receiving monthly fees from thousands of members, Whelan set up a real company with contractors, and planned glamorous retreats where attendees
				could enjoy yoga, breathwork, and bonding activities.</p>
			<p>Whelan’s pitch had been tailored to her generation’s fantasy of success: quantifiable influence on a social platform, a flexible schedule working from a MacBook Air, unlimited world travel, virtuous accumulation of wealth. But her business model
				might have been familiar to the Breakaway members’ grandparents. The best way to get started in the group as a seller for Enagic was to buy at least one K8 water-ionizing machine yourself (or another, less expensive Enagic product, like a $2,890
				shower filter); then you were encouraged to bring in other people to sell machines themselves, passing a chunk of their commission checks on to you.</p>
			<p>In other words, this was classic multilevel marketing, optimized and freshened up for Gen Z. Amelia Whelan’s influencer sheen would help to bring an old business proposition to a wide, new audience. But that same, new audience was about to bring a
				lot of trouble in return.</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>From the start, Whelan tried to put her rapidly growing water-machine sales force at ease about the nature of their work. “No one wants to get involved in anything that is shady or unethical,” she explained in one of her early informational
				videos. “It’s a lot like real estate, honestly.”</p>
			<p>Multilevel marketing is not, in fact, that much like real estate. The phrase describes a form of person-to-person sales in which your income is partly a function of your ability to expand the network. The more recruiting you do for new
				salespeople, the more money you make. That works fine, so long as the products that you’re selling are easy to unload, and the supply of new recruits never dwindles. In reality, distributors in these MLM businesses may be set up to fail by weak
				demand, and by a byzantine structure that can leave them to amass unsold inventory while recruiting more and more salespeople into their downline.</p>

			</p>
			<p>The best-known MLM companies of a generation ago—Tupperware, Avon, Amway, Mary Kay—mixed suspect commerce with a genuine sense of community. Participants sold functional household items and basic beauty products at cozy living-room parties,
				surrounded by their friends and family. “You’d get a nice card in the mail or a direct phone call, which was really sweet and feels personal,” says Jane Marie, an executive producer and co-creator of the podcast
				<em>The Dream</em>, which reports on MLM culture. “It would be a bunch of ladies getting together to have tea or wine and shop, but mostly just, like, hang out.”</p>
			<p>Whelan’s Breakaway Movement would not seem to have much in common with these sip-and-browse affairs, aside from its connections to a similar commercial structure. In place of cheap, disposable housewares, Whelan and other members sell luxury water
				machines that are meant to fit into a sleek, environmentally friendly, minimalist lifestyle. And if the Avon lady was someone you knew who would drop by your house and have a cup of coffee while she gave her spiel, Whelan presents herself as an
				untouchable celebrity posting from thousands of miles away, usually from Indonesia or Hawaii. She’s not your cousin or your neighbor; she’s an
				<em>influencer</em>. That means she, like others who ascend the ranks of today’s multilevel-marketing companies, can recruit from all over the world—an Instagram-famous salesperson for an Instagram-famous brand, selling access to her expertise in
				online groups or exclusive meetups: Imagine if an Avon lady could knock on 100,000 doors at once. Recruits come in through referral links, and it takes mere minutes to go from scrolling through an Instagram feed to typing in your credit-card number
				and getting started.</p>
			<p>MLMs like Enagic have boomed online in recent years, selling essential oils (doTERRA, Young Living), fitness products (Beachbody, It Works), beauty products (Monat, Arbonne), or women’s fashion (Paparazzi, LuLaRoe). At the same time, their global
				reach poses problems of its own. An insinuation of grandeur, posted to Instagram over and over, with only slightly varying images and phrases, may well lead to exponential business growth. But the same message, and the same posts, can be quickly
				fact-checked on the internet, and debunkings will go viral too. Indeed, many of these companies have been publicly excoriated, thanks to ex-distributor testimonials shared on social media, the same platform that enabled their success.</p>
			<p>The faux-warm “hey hun” used by MLM recruiters in Instagram and Facebook messages is by now a meme, and an
				<a href="https://subredditstats.com/r/antiMLM">“antiMLM” forum</a>
				on Reddit went from having fewer than 1,000 members at the beginning of 2017 to more than 740,000 by the time of writing. A recent special report from the industry trade publication
				<em>Social Selling News</em>
				described the “troubling rise” of
				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/01/anti-mlm-reddit-youtube/617816/?utm_source=feed">anti-MLM sentiment</a>
				on YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms, and quoted Joe Mariano, the president of the Direct Selling Association, as saying that this was different from “the general kind of public perception issues that we have always had.” Paranoia has been growing
				in his industry about “<a href="https://socialsellingnews.com/features/the-ftc-is-on-the-warpath-time-to-rally-the-troops/">a group of unlikely allies</a>,” including anti-MLM social-media influencers, longtime consumer advocates, and government regulators, who are angling for the Federal Trade Commission to get more involved in MLM business practices. The August
				<a href="https://socialsellingnews.com/features/lina-khan-takes-the-helm-at-ftc/">cover story of
					<em>Social Selling News</em>
				</a>
				was a hand-wringing article about the new FTC chair and “<a href="https://socialsellingnews.com/features/lina-khan-takes-the-helm-at-ftc/">progressive millennial</a>” Lina Khan.</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/tiktok-bans-multilevel-marketing-mlm/617422/?utm_source=feed">Read: The internet is starting to turn on MLMs</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>The “unlikely allies” have had a real effect, according to data presented by William Keep, a professor of marketing at the College of New Jersey. MLMs are struggling to recruit, he says, and he claims that their trade association has finagled its
				numbers in annual reports to obscure this fact. (A spokesperson for the Direct Selling Association did not refute Keep’s analysis when contacted by email, but linked to
				<a href="https://www.dsa.org/events/news/individual-press-release/US-Direct-Selling-Expected-to-Grow-in-2021-According-to-New-DSA-Forecast">the organization’s own</a>
				study projecting industry growth.)
				<em>Time</em>
				reported last year that consumer complaints to the FTC about MLM companies have been on the rise, and if you search for any MLM that was popular two or three years ago on YouTube, you may see a wall of text like this: “Ex Beachbody Coach EXPOSES THE
				TRUTH,” “Why I Stopped Selling Younique | THE TEA,” “THE TRUTH ABOUT MONAT | Pyramid scheme? Hair loss? Free car? Why did I quit?” Or even:</p>
			<p>“Breakaway Movement Scam.”</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>When Kathryn Human, then an undergraduate student at the University of Pittsburgh, found the Breakaway Movement in September 2019, she was working part-time at a restaurant and struggling with medical debt accrued over the course of a chronic
				illness. She was looking into getting a sugar daddy or selling her plasma when she came across the group on Instagram, and signed up almost immediately. “I was sitting in Starbucks in between classes trying to get through these videos, being like,<em>
					I just have to figure out what to do to make the money</em>,” she told me.</p>
			<p>A friend told her it sounded like a pyramid scheme, and she got embarrassed and backed out. Now she gets angry thinking about the group’s worldview. Human, who is Black and biracial, remembers listening to Whelan and other members talk about the
				idea that, as she interpreted it, poor people stay poor because of their attitudes. “Of course you’re saying this; you’re a wealthy white person who lives on an island,” she said. (Whelan told
				<em>The Atlantic</em>
				she did not say this outright, but added, “I have contributed my own poor ‘money mindset’ to personal financial struggles and stress I have felt and experienced in my own life.”) Describing herself as a young, broke college student with an interest
				in spirituality and community, Human says she was a “perfect target” for Breakaway’s pitch. “I have a great friend group, my family is great, but being supported financially is something that I’d never had,” she said. “The community being like,
				<em>We all uplift each other; we all get rich together</em>—that seemed really appealing to me.”</p>
			<p>MLMs can exploit that kind of desperation; indeed, they tend to thrive in times of economic instability. In March 2020, the Breakaway Movement contractor and Enagic distributor Sean Little posted a video that seemed to encourage community members
				to buy water-ionizing machines to fend off both the health and financial impacts of the pandemic. “No. 1, our immune systems have never needed the help more than right now,” he explained. “Buy the machine; get the machine in your house. No. 2, people
				are out of work, people are laid off, people are postponed to return to work. People are looking for ways to earn income … There are a whole host of financing options for you to be able to purchase a K8.” (Little told me via email that he does not
				believe that Enagic machines can prevent COVID-19, but he does think it’s therapeutic to drink ionized water.)</p>
			<p>Enagic’s water-ionizing machines promise to transform tap water into something different by adjusting its pH by varying degrees. Highly acidic water can be used to clean countertops and toothbrushes, slightly acidic water is “beauty water” for
				washing your face or conditioning your hair, and strongly alkaline water can be used for rinsing produce and removing toilet-bowl stains. But Breakaway members most often tout the benefits of drinking slightly alkaline, “hydrogen-rich” Kangen Water,
				referring to its therapeutic qualities and superiority to the knock-off “alkaline” water products sold in (wasteful) plastic bottles at the grocery store. Evidence for the former
				<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/kangen-water-supposed-healthier-154517630.html">remains limited</a>; many
				<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924224411002408">studies</a>
				of the
				<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6352572/">topic</a>
				have been paid for by the so-called
				<a href="http://www.akloma.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/321-1422-1-PB.pdf">functional-water industry</a>. At any rate, Enagic’s K8 machine sits at the higher end of the price range for
				<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=water+ionizer+machine&amp;amp;i=garden&amp;amp;crid=W6P02POXOL82&amp;amp;sprefix=water+ionizer+machine%2Cgarden%2C340&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_21">similar products</a>, and
				<a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/controversial-science-news-quackery/alkaline-water-nonsense">critics note</a>
				that the pH of water can be altered just as easily with baking soda or vinegar.</p>

			<p>Six months after Little made his pandemic pitch, and with the number of COVID cases entering its third wave, the company discovered that it had accidentally attracted attention from the wrong person: a YouTuber known for studious one-woman
				documentaries picking apart online phenomena, shared under the name Anna’s Analysis. “I Joined the Breakaway Movement So You Don’t Have To,” she titled
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTU0SC5SJQU">her presentation</a>, which is more than two hours long and, she says, based on six months of research. The video runs through a battery of topics, criticizing Breakaway Movement members for
				promoting pseudoscience, for its obsession with exclusivity and wealth, for its whiteness, and—most of all—for the claims of its founder that it was
				<em>not</em>
				an MLM.</p>
			<p>“I’m gonna try not to get worked up in this video, because there is a lot of stuff that makes me mad,” Anna says, after playing a clip of Whelan saying that Enagic isn’t an MLM. She pulls up the illustration in Whelan’s video of Enagic’s
				compensation plan. In it, an imaginary distributor’s sales and subordinates are arranged awkwardly side by side, with arrows to indicate the flow of commission checks. “Let me draw this exact same thing for you except for with the lines a little more
				organized in a way that makes sense,” she says. On a whiteboard, Anna illustrates an imaginary distributor who sells to two people, one of whom also sells to five more people. “It doesn’t matter if you make it a rectangle, or draw a squiggly line
				over here,” she says. “At the end of the day it’s still an MLM, and it still has a triangle shape.”</p>
			<p>By November 2020, the feature-length video had more than 400,000 views. (At this point, it’s at more than 850,000.) In the private Facebook group, one Breakaway Movement member encouraged others to watch positive videos about the Breakaway
				Movement as a means of pushing the Anna’s Analysis video down in search results. (“I think with your support we can work the algorithms in our favor,” the member wrote.) Other YouTubers had already been sharing lengthy investigations of the Breakaway
				Movement, declaring it a “scam” or a “cult,” but this situation was more serious—the meticulously crafted straw that broke the camel’s back, and attracted the attention of hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
			<p>Later that month, Whelan led a Zoom call in which she seemed more nervous than usual—though still casual-cool, wearing a silver nose ring, a boxy lavender T-shirt, and matching chandelier earrings. “My intention is just to be super transparent
				with you all,” she said. Enagic, she’d come to understand, was a multilevel-marketing company after all. (Enagic doesn’t deny this, though it sometimes uses the terms
				<em>direct sales</em>
				or
				<em>human-based marketing</em>
				instead.) Multilevel marketing is “incredible, and it’s something that I personally am so proud to be involved in,” she continued, highlighting the fact that most MLM distributors are women. “Breakaway Movement is owned by a female,” she added,
				referring to herself. “Which is dope.”</p>
			<p>Whelan alluded to her own youth and inexperience, saying she’d begun working on Breakaway as a 23-year-old with no knowledge of how to run a real business. In recent months, she explained, she’d learned a lot about the world and the various
				bureaucratic entities in it. “FTC is the big boys on the top,” she said, with some uncertainty. The letters stand for “Federal Trading Committee, I believe.” But later in the call, her voice got stronger, and she portrayed the FTC as a pedantic
				government scold. “FTC likes to view everyone on the internet as
				<em>vulnerable</em>,” she said, framing the last word with air quotes. “They believe that when we promote income claims, or how much money we’re earning with something, that it can be
				<em>misleading
				</em>… or, I’m forgetting the word, like,
				<em>persuasive</em>
				to someone who is a
				<em>vulnerable</em>
				person on the internet.” This didn’t make sense, she said, because any dentist is allowed to tell you that they make $100,000 a year, and then you’d be like, “That’s dope; thank you for being a dentist.” But these are the rules, she said, and the
				Breakaway Movement is going to have to follow them even if she feels they are “crazy.”</p>
			<p>The comments below the video remained upbeat. “So so so happy to have pressed play on this call,” one community member wrote. “Thanks so much for always being as sincere as you can be!” But in the months that followed, while Whelan remained in
				communication with Breakaway members on Zoom and in the Facebook group, she stepped back from her Instagram account. For the rest of that winter, and all through the following spring, her followers would see no more photographs of the salt, sand, and
				smoothie lifestyle that Breakaway had helped Whelan build and secure.</p>
			<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
			<p>Last March, I had a call with one of the first Breakaway members and head of community engagement, Gina Marovic, to talk about the company’s handling of the YouTube-video fallout. At the time, she and her colleagues were overhauling their training
				videos to acknowledge that Enagic is indeed an MLM. The previous error—which Marovic called “misinformation”—had caused them a lot of grief, she said, and Whelan was accepting full blame for that. “Amelia blatantly said, ‘This is not an MLM-marketing
				thing,’ and it’s like, ‘No, it<em>
					is</em>, Amelia … Why are you acting like it’s not?’” she said, and laughed a little.</p>
			<p>Marovic told me that the company was grateful for the original YouTube video from Anna’s Analysis, which brought attention to things it needed to improve. Then she referred to it as “the hate video.” As in, the hate video that is the first thing
				anyone sees when they Google the Breakaway Movement because they’re thinking about joining. As in, “The hate video has hurt [Breakaway] immensely, which is why we’re doing so many changes.”</p>
			<p>Whelan posted to the Facebook group herself a few weeks later, explaining that she had been in touch with me about this story. (I had joined that group in February, with
				<em>The Atlantic</em>
				paying about $130 worth of monthly fees on my behalf.) She did warn members that my article might not “speak highly” of Breakaway, but she also framed it as a positive development, sharing the news with a Millennial-pink graphic that paired the
				movement’s logo and
				<em>The Atlantic</em>’s logo in the manner of a fashion collaboration. “Thank you for the transparency, the trust and your leadership!” one comment read. “You have such a strong yet sincere heart Amelia!”</p>
			<p>As Breakaway’s leader, Amelia Whelan had presented a fresh, modern face for MLMs. Now her group was encountering a modern problem. In the days of Tupperware parties and next-door Avon ladies, an MLM might fizzle or burn out, but it could do so
				with less drama, and far less public discussion. “I did not see anyone come out of an MLM and admit that something went wrong,” Jane Marie told me, referring to her own childhood exposure to MLM culture. Participants had an emotional and
				psychological incentive to accept personal blame for any failure, she remembered—to say, “I wasn’t scammed; I wasn’t ripping off my mom and my aunt and my cousin and my co-workers.” But as a social-media phenomenon, the whole scheme is based on a
				bigger, looser, more fragile set of social ties. Disillusionment is more threatening because, like growth, it doesn’t happen in geographically isolated groups. Like growth, it happens at scale.</p>
			<p>Whelan built the Breakaway Movement like any viral online brand, by posting warm invitations paired with images that suggested the possibility of a better life. Viral content made by other influencers put her brand under threat, and Breakaway in
				the position of needing crisis reputation management. At first, she asked members to avoid watching videos that described Breakaway as a “scam” or a “cult,” and instead watch and engage with positive testimonials about the company “as many times as
				you can.” That behavior would, of course, push critical takes further down the YouTube search results, though Whelan denied that she had this motivation. But these search results were still a problem, even after Breakaway’s subsequent publication of
				a video called “Breakaway Movement Exposed | The Truth Revealed,” which co-opted keywords of the anti-MLM community, and in which Whelan and Little spent 30 minutes discussing the “constructive criticism” the company endured.</p>
			<p>The original video from Anna’s Analysis still shows up at the top of the list when you search for the Breakaway Movement on YouTube; just below it is her two-hour follow-up video from August, “Checking Back In With the Breakaway Movement.”
				Whelan’s private group has shrunk to about 2,000 members, just half of what it was when I first joined. In my conversations with former members of Breakaway, I spoke with several women who had left the organization. They didn’t express bitterness
				toward the company exactly, but they did feel disenchanted. “I no longer felt inspired by her,” a 24-year-old former member from Austria told me, referring to Whelan. “I no longer trust her, I guess. Not that she’s a bad person or anything.” (The
				former member said she did not want to share her name for privacy reasons, and to avoid getting involved "in any drama.")</p>
			<p>It might still be possible for Breakaway to turn itself around—especially if Whelan continues to be up front about what the company actually is—but the pure excitement of its early days are over. No matter what else changes, Breakaway won’t be
				able to escape the ethical quandary of its business model: To succeed, you recruit; to recruit, you offer a fantasy. Why else would anyone sign up to market an extremely expensive system for doing confusing things to water? Still, if there's one
				overarching lesson to be gleaned from Breakaway’s “money mindset” videos, it’s that having these kinds of doubts about the MLM business model will attract nothing but negative energy, and keep you frozen in a place of
				<em>scarcity</em>
				and
				<em>lack</em>. A business like Whalen’s may have to become more rhetorically careful, or make some ethical adjustments, or even suffer public embarrassment. But it can never let the haters win.</p>
			<p>In May, Whelan announced her return to Instagram after a long, clarifying hiatus—“147 days of true presence and appreciation,” during which time she says she took a candle-making course and rescued a duck named Greg. She quickly resumed sharing

		<content type="html">
			<p>Every now and then, China’s Communist insiders, in their frantic attempts to shield themselves against international criticism, inadvertently let slip what truly scares them. So it was recently in the tragic case of Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis
				star who disappeared after accusing one of China’s most senior leaders of sexual assault. The scandal has embarrassed the Communist Party and posed a new threat to Beijing’s already beleaguered Olympic Winter Games.</p>
			<p>Hu Xijin, the outspoken editor of the
				<em>Global Times</em>, a Communist Party–run news outlet,
				<a href="https://twitter.com/huxijin_gt/status/1461368950495739906">tweeted that</a>
				“as a person who is familiar with Chinese system, I don’t believe Peng Shuai has received retaliation and repression.” Later, in response to a Peng supporter,
				<a href="https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1461616999897862148">he added</a>, “You should understand China, including understanding how the system you dislike has promoted the actual rights of the 1.4 billion Chinese.”
				<a href="https://twitter.com/HuXijin_GT/status/1462999925961101313">And again</a>: “Some Western forces are coercing Peng Shuai and an institution, forcing them to help demonize China’s system.”</p>
			<p>Hu doth protest too much. The unfolding saga is all about China’s political and social systems. Peng, whose true status and whereabouts remain unknown, has ripped the curtain away from the dark and nasty world of the Communist Party’s inner
				sanctum, exposing its inherent iniquities and abuses of power to an extent few other incidents in recent times have. Out have spilled the raw realities of a Chinese society in which women are victimized and have no voice; its rulers can act with
				impunity, and their highest priority is to protect themselves from scrutiny by either the international community or their own citizens. And yet, despite closing ranks around a more and more desperate (and amazingly amateurish) propaganda campaign,
				they have not been able to pull the curtain back over the mess.</p>
			<p>For the country’s president, Xi Jinping, and its other senior leaders, the scandal could not have erupted at a more sensitive moment. They have already been parrying
				<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/23/peng-shaui-olympic-boycott-calls/">calls</a>
				to boycott the Winter Games, scheduled for February, in protest of the country’s abysmal human-rights record—calls given more weight and urgency by Peng’s ordeal. At the very least, the incident may taint a sports spectacle that the regime had hoped
				would showcase the wonders of a new rich and powerful China, much as the 2008 Games held in Beijing were a coming-out party for a rejuvenated nation. More broadly, the embarrassment undercuts Beijing’s widening global campaign to present its
				governance system as more just than chaotic American democracy, and thus a superior model for the rest of the world. It’s therefore a setback for China in its confrontation with the United States and quest to elevate the stature of authoritarian rule
				on the international stage.</p>

				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/11/china-xi-jinping/620645/?utm_source=feed">Read: Xi Jinping’s terrifying new China</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>The Peng saga began with a social-media post. Early this month,
				<a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/players/160471/shuai-peng/rankings-history">Peng</a>, a former world No. 1 player in doubles, alleged on Weibo, China’s censored version of Twitter, that the former vice premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted
				her. “That afternoon I didn’t agree, and I kept crying,” she wrote. Peng revealed some sordid details. The alleged attack took place at Zhang’s home, as someone guarded the door, according to Peng. She also described a consensual affair she’d had
				with Zhang—Peng wasn’t exact about the dates or timeline—with the full knowledge of Zhang’s wife, whom Peng calls “Auntie Kang.” “You played with me, and dumped me when you are done with me,” Peng wrote.</p>
			<p>The natural next step, especially in the #MeToo era, would be to launch an inquiry into Peng’s charges. But that’s not how the Communist Party responded. In the eyes of its top leaders, Peng had tarnished them, the party, and the nation. The
				rights of an individual—even one of the country’s most prominent sports stars—can never rank above the interests of the party, which to its leadership are equivalent to the interests of China. Moreover, taking her claims seriously might encourage
				more whistleblowers to reveal other skeletons in the Communist closet. The post vanished, and
				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/21/world/asia/where-is-peng-shuai.html">so did Peng</a>.</p>
			<p>The global public noticed her disappearance, and a #WhereIsPengShuai movement began online. But the person who gave the effort real heft is an unlikely figure: Steve Simon, the chief executive officer of the Women’s Tennis Association. He
				<a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/2356029/statement-by-steve-simon-wta-chairman-ceo">demanded proof</a>
				that Peng was safe and had freedom of action, and an investigation into her accusation. He also threatened to withdraw his business from the country. That step would potentially sacrifice some serious cash. In 2018, the WTA signed a deal to hold its
				prestigious Finals in China for 10 years. But Simon insists he would choose principle over profit.</p>
			<p>“If anyone wants to question our fortitude behind a statement like that, they can certainly try to,” Simon said in a
				<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/business/2021/11/19/steve-simon-womens-tennis-association-chairman-peng-shuai-ebof-sot-vpx.cnn">televised interview</a>. “We have to start, as a world, making decisions that are based upon right and wrong, period. And we can’t compromise that.” Peng’s case, he continued, is “bigger than the business.”</p>
			<p>China’s leaders, incapable of conceding to foreign pressure, refused to cooperate and instead launched a propaganda campaign through state-controlled media outlets to try to convince the world that Peng was safe and sound. Ineptly conceived, it
				failed miserably.
				<a href="https://twitter.com/cgtnofficial/status/1461025491842916358">An email</a>
				purportedly written by Peng, and released by a Chinese television network, asserted her well-being and retracted her allegation against Zhang in language too stilted to be credible. The
				<em>Global Times</em>’ Hu
				<a href="https://twitter.com/huxijin_gt/status/1462075117266096135">passed around videos</a>
				supposedly showing Peng at a Beijing restaurant, one of which featured dinner companions who were unusually fixated on the date—Peng might as well have been holding up a newspaper. The only people fooled seemed to be the officials of the
				International Olympic Committee, who, probably desperate to rescue the Winter Games, participated in the charade by holding
				<a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-president-and-ioc-athletes-commission-chair-hold-video-call-with-peng-shuai">a video call</a>
				with Peng—and then endured an avalanche of international criticism. Somehow, though, Peng has never found the time to speak with Steve Simon, who
				<a href="https://www.wtatennis.com/news/2361225/statement-by-steve-simon-wta-chairman-ceo-on-recent-video-posted-by-china-state-run-media-of-peng-shuai">hasn’t bought any of it</a>. A growing list of prominent supporters, including the
				<a href="https://www.axios.com/white-house-proof-peng-shauis-china-f7f25022-e674-4c63-8517-9411d4bbfc61.html">Biden administration</a>
				and
				<a href="https://twitter.com/serenawilliams/status/1461408866697105413">Serena Williams</a>, have expressed their concern for Peng.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, her ordeal tells us quite a bit about Chinese society today. Sexual violence and harassment are not taken seriously enough; many victims find their plight ignored, or worse. In one high-profile example, a Beijing court
				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/world/asia/china-zhou-xiaoxuan-metoo.html">recently rejected a case</a>
				brought by Zhou Xiaoxuan against a famous television anchor, whom she accused of sexually assaulting her in a dressing room. The journalist Sophia Huang Xueqin, a well-known #MeToo activist who has helped women report cases of sexual abuse, is being
				<a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/11/china-metoo-journalist-and-labour-activist-facing-subversion-charge-must-be-released/">charged by Chinese authorities</a>
				with subversion. Earlier this year, a female employee of the e-commerce giant Alibaba posted an account on the company’s internal website of an alleged sexual assault by a manager during a business trip, adding that she had reported the incident to
				company officials but no action was taken. Alibaba eventually sacked the accused manager, as well as
				<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/alibaba-fires-10-for-leaking-sexual-assault-accusations?sref=4LEYncfM">10 employees who had leaked the account</a>
				to the public. Prosecutors
				<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/business/china-alibaba-rape.html">dropped the case</a>
				against the manager.</p>
			<p>The Peng story also shows that China’s leadership will tolerate no challenge to its authority, no matter how apolitical. Peng is not aiming to bring down the Communist regime. She’s not advocating for democracy, or calling for reform, or even
				directly standing up for women’s rights. Yet she is being treated as if she is. For a political party that presents itself as infallible, anything that suggests otherwise is perceived as dangerous. The corollary to this rule is that the party’s most
				senior leaders, especially those with the right connections and relationships, can act as they wish, without fear of public scrutiny or reproach. Perhaps at some point the party will quietly punish Zhang (less for any sex crime than because his poor
				judgment left the party vulnerable). But, at least for now, the party will prioritize fixing its image over addressing any wrongdoing, let alone wider discrimination against women.</p>
			<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
				<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/07/china-australia-america/619544/?utm_source=feed">Read: China discovers the limits of its power</a>]</i>
			</p>
			<p>The Communist Party is equally resistant to challenges from abroad. The conflict between Beijing and the WTA could probably be resolved if Peng were to hop on the phone with Simon. But to China’s leaders, that would be tantamount to an admission
				of guilt and a surrender to foreign forces, and therefore unacceptable. Instead, China’s top cadres assume they are strong enough, and their economy is big enough, to eventually browbeat the world into silence.</p>
			<p>They’re not entirely wrong. The Peng situation seems unlikely to derail the upcoming Olympics (though it might make them more controversial). Still, there will be a cost. If a settlement can’t be reached with the WTA, and Simon follows through on
				his threat and ends the tour’s operations in China, the government’s treatment of Peng will have done serious damage to China’s standing in international professional sports. Simon’s action would put pressure on other sports organizations to follow
				his lead. The loss for China would go beyond financial, or even reputational. It would be a sign of how Beijing’s human-rights abuses are souring its relations with much of the world at a moment when it is striving to claim world leadership.</p>
			<p>And then there is Peng’s personal tragedy. The most to hope for is that Peng has let other women in China know they are not alone, at least for a fleeting moment. The Communist Party will eventually recover from her admissions; Peng herself may
				not. She will likely never be forgiven for airing the imperial court’s dirty laundry.</p>
			<p>Even as she typed her fateful message, she feared it would come to nothing. “It doesn’t matter if I’m hitting a rock with an egg, or being a moth that flies towards the flame,” she wrote, addressing Zhang. “I am telling the truth about what
				happened between us. With your intelligence and wits I am sure you will either deny it, or blame it on me.”</p>
			<p>“You always say you hope your mother in heaven could bless you,” she continued. “Do you still have the courage to face your mother after what you have done in your lifetime? We sure all like to pretend we are virtuous ...” Especially the party.</p>

			<p>Some white Americans have been led to fear that they could be massacred like the Tutsis of Rwanda.

				of whom are white—instructing “kids to identify in racial terms,” as Blake Masters, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Arizona,
				<a href="http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/080921_masters_white_racism/az-senate-candidate-blake-masters-says-critical-race-theory-anti-white-racism/">said</a>
				in May. “You are good or bad, depending on what you look like. At this point it is straight up anti-white racism. I don’t think we’re allowed to say that. But let’s call it what it is.”</p>
			<p>Even when GOP politicians and operatives don’t openly “call it what it is,” they end up echoing Masters nonetheless, saying without saying that “critical race theory is explicitly anti-white,” to
				<a href="https://twitter.com/realchrisrufo/status/1397620203387703299">use</a>
				the words of Christopher F. Rufo, a travel-documentary filmmaker turned leading critic of CRT. At his final campaign rally, in Loudoun County, Virginia, Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin
				<a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/579536-mcauliffe-youngkin-hold-final-campaign-rallies-ahead-of-tight-virginia">said</a>, “What we won’t do is teach our children to view everything through a lens of race where we divide them into buckets and one group is an oppressor and the other is a victim and we pit them against each other and we steal their dreams.”</p>
			<p>Republicans provoked a backlash against CRT, which
				<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory">they also call</a>
				anti-racism or wokism. Their backlash won 2021 elections. “But it wasn’t a backlash of parents,” William Saletan
				<a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/11/polls-critical-race-theory-virginia-election.html?via=rss_socialflow_twitter">found</a>
				in his close study of polling data. “It was a backlash of white people.”</p>
			<p>How many Americans know that the claim that anti-racism is harmful to white people is one of the basic mantras of white-supremacist ideology? Americans are familiar with white-supremacist movements like the Klan, skinheads, neo-Nazis, and the
				Proud Boys. But they don’t seem to recognize white-supremacist<i>
					ideology</i>—the most venomous form of racist ideology. I suspect that many Americans don’t know how much white-supremacist ideology shapes their political thought and America’s political discourse, and allows juries to exonerate racism and convict anti-racism.</p>

			<p>Some Democrats have predictably made it a bipartisan affair. As Nikole Hannah-Jones, the creator of the 1619 Project, recently
				<a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-11-14/nikole-hannah-jones-the-1619-project-book">told</a>

			<p>
				<a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1859/01/19/78883394.html?pageNumber=4">Centrists</a>

				<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/white-backlash-nothing-new/611914/?utm_source=feed">backlash</a>
				(causing Democrats to lose elections in 1966 and 1968). Some centrist Democrats today say “woke” politics have gone too far and provoked the “<a href="https://www.newsmax.com/newsmax-tv/glenn-youngkin-virginia-governor-matt-schlapp/2021/11/02/id/1043053/">wokelash</a>” (causing Democrats to lose elections in 2021). “Some of these people need to go to a ‘woke’ detox center or something,” the Democratic political strategist James Carville
				<a href="https://news.yahoo.com/james-carville-rips-democrats-over-081535774.html">said</a>
				after the 2021 elections. “They’re expressing a language that people just don’t use and there’s backlash and a frustration at that.” Actually, GOP operatives are expressing (or whistling) an anti-white language that anti-racists just don’t use—and
				there’s a backlash and frustration at
				<i>that</i>.</p>
			<p>“Anti-racism is anti-white” is the mantra dividing the Democratic Party, especially since the 2021 elections. It is the mantra unifying the Republican Party, especially since the 2020 election. There are numerous variations on this mantra. “Wokeism”

				anti-racism

				<i>or</i>
				“cancel culture”
				<i>or</i>

				<i>or</i>
				anyone challenging racial inequity is said to be anti-white or racist or an anti-white racist. And variations on this mantra have become so ubiquitous in the American political discourse that people can easily dismiss or deny its origin in
				white-supremacist thought.</p>
			<p class="dropcap">W<span class="smallcaps">hen Robert Whitaker, 76</span>, died in June 2017, white supremacists reflected on his legacy online. “Perhaps his most important, and most lasting, legacy is that his incessant promotion of theterm‘anti-white’ is now slowly but surely going mainstream,” someone named “Bellatrix”
				<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2017/06/07/bob-whitaker-author-racist-mantra-white-genocide-has-died">said</a>
				on Stormfront, the prominent white-supremacist website. “A very important corner to turn indeed, as it is the rebuttal of the accusation of racist.”</p>
			<p>Whitaker, a former economics professor and Reagan appointee to the Office of Personnel Management, had been radicalized as a young man in opposition to the civil-rights movement. He was a propagandist for more than half a century. But Whitaker’s
				fame among the most extreme white supremacists came toward the end of his life, when he wrote a screed called “The Mantra.”</p>
			<p>“Everybody says there is this race problem. Everybody says this race problem will be solved when the third world pours into every white country and only into white countries,” Whitaker
				<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/following-white-rabbit">wrote</a>
				in “The Mantra,” which he first posted on his blog and the websites of a neo-Nazi organization in 2006. “But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives
				agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.”</p>
			<p>“The Mantra”
				<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/following-white-rabbit">ends</a>
				with what has become the new mantra in American politics: “They say they are anti-racist. What they are is anti-white. Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white.”</p>
			<p>Over the next decade, and particularly after Barack Obama’s election, a self-identified “<a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2013/following-white-rabbit">swarm</a>” of online trolls posted quotes and reprinted “The Mantra” online wherever they could, and attacked anti-racists as “racist” whenever they could.</p>
			<p>Whitaker’s mantra has been linked to some of the deadliest acts of white-supremacist terror over the past decade. Anders Breivik murdered 77 people in Norway in 2011. On the day of his terrorist attack, the leader of the swarm,

			<p>Many Americans have had contact with Whitaker’s ideas, likely without knowing it. In the days after Roof’s massacre, Morris Dees and J. Richard Cohen, the founder and president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, pointed this out. “In recent
				years, extremists have distilled the notion of white genocide to ‘the mantra,’ parts of which show up on billboards throughout the South, as well as Internet chat rooms,” they

			<p class="dropcap">W<span class="smallcaps">hitaker did not create</span>
				the mantra. He reproduced it. Since the very first Civil Rights Act, white supremacists have cast anti-racist bills as racist toward white people. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 defined citizenship, granted it to African Americans, and affirmed that
				all citizens are equally protected by the law. But President Andrew Johnson vetoed it,
				<a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/march-27-1866-veto-message-civil-rights-legislation">arguing</a>
				that “the distinction of race and color is by the bill made to operate in favor of the colored against the white race.” In an address to Congress in 1867, Johnson opposed voting rights for Black men,
				<a href="https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/december-3-1867-third-annual-message-congress">fearing</a>
				“the dread of Negro supremacy” and the “subjection” of “white people of the South.” In his best-selling 1874 book, the journalist James S. Pike
				<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Prostrate_State/1xR2B7zJdI4C?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;pg=PA1&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover">described</a>
				South Carolina’s
				<i>interracial</i>
				legislature as denying “the exercise of the rights of white communities, because they are white.” When an anti-lynching bill came before the U.S. Senate in 1938, Senator and
				<a href="https://allthatsinteresting.com/famous-kkk-members/2">lifelong Klansman</a>
				Theodore Bilbo of Mississippi said its passage “will open the floodgates of hell in the South.”</p>
			<p>When a new civil-rights plank was added to the Democratic Party’s platform, southern segregationists walked out of the Democratic National Convention in 1948. They formed the States’ Rights Democratic Party, known popularly as the Dixiecrats,
				running Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina for U.S. president. “We affirm that the effective enforcement of such a [civil-rights] program would be utterly destructive of the social, economic and political life of the Southern people,” their
				platform
				<a href="https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/platform-the-states-rights-democratic-party">stated</a>.</p>
			<p>Thomas Abernethy, the Jim Crow segregationist and U.S. representative from Mississippi,
				<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1957-pt7/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1957-pt7-1.pdf">feared</a>
				that the Civil Rights Act of 1957 would create “nothing short of an assemblage of powerful Federal meddlers and spies created for the purpose of tormenting, abusing, and embarrassing southern white people.” During his 24-hour-long filibuster of the
				Civil Rights Act of 1964, Thurmond
				<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1957-pt12/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1957-pt12-6.pdf">cited</a>
				a newspaper article that warned of the “persecution” that white people could face under the law.</p>
			<p>When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 passed, opponents of racial equity largely stopped openly claiming that anti-racist measures were harmful to white people. They instead claimed that anti-racist efforts to remedy racial inequality constituted
				“reverse discrimination” or “reverse racism” (against white people). They weaponized the very Civil Rights Acts they had long opposed against the policies and programs leading to integration, enfranchisement, racial equity, and racial justice. When
				the medicine is rebranded as the disease, the disease will inevitably persist—and it has.</p>

				the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as “discrimination ... being practiced to wipe out discrimination.” In a televised presidential-campaign speech in 1976, Ronald Reagan
				<a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1976/07/07/75718385.html?pageNumber=14">said</a>, “If you happen to belong to an ethnic group not recognized by the federal government as entitled to special treatment, you are a victim of reverse discrimination.” In 1995, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas
				<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-CRECB-1995-pt14/pdf/GPO-CRECB-1995-pt14-3.pdf">said</a>, “You cannot give somebody preference over somebody else without discriminating against the person who is not receiving the preference.” Or, as Chief Justice John Roberts
				<a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/551/701/">wrote</a>
				in 2009, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”</p>

			<p class="dropcap">O<span class="smallcaps">f all the arguments</span>
				that animate the anti-abortion cause, two stand out as particularly far-fetched: that banning abortion protects women’s health and shields African Americans from genocide. Yet for years, these arguments have driven debates over state laws, served as
				justifications for court decisions upholding those laws, and even appeared on billboards warning women in predominantly Black communities not to kill their babies. Three years ago, Mississippi lawmakers prohibited almost all abortions after 15 weeks
				of pregnancy to save women, they said, from serious “<a href="http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2018/html/HB/1500-1599/HB1510PS.htm">medical, emotional, and psychological</a>” damage.</p>
			<p>It has taken a federal judge to call out these claims for what they surely are: “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/social-issues/pure-gaslighting-federal-judge-strikes-down-mississippi-ban-on-abortions-after-15-weeks/2018/11/21/02dd0670-ed9f-11e8-96d4-0d23f2aaad09_story.html">pure gaslighting</a>.”</p>
			<p>Tomorrow, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in
				<i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization</i>, likely the most consequential abortion case in three decades. The case began as a challenge to the Mississippi abortion ban, and in 2018 landed before Carlton Reeves, an African American judge
				whose legal opinions—especially this one—are rich in history and disarmingly honest. Reeves struck down the law, as precedents like the 1973 landmark abortion decision,
				<i>Roe v. Wade</i>, compelled him to do, but then lambasted the Mississippi legislature for trying to justify the ban with reasons that he believed were transparently dishonest.</p>
			<p>“Its leaders are proud to challenge
				<i>Roe</i>,” he
				<a href="https://casetext.com/case/jackson-womens-health-org-v-currier-7">wrote</a>, “but choose not to lift a finger to address the tragedies lurking on the other side of the delivery room.” I spoke with Reeves recently, and his opinions out of
				court are as candid as the ones he delivers from chambers and the bench. “Judges are heroes,” he told me. “But for them I would not be in the position that I am or had the experiences that I did. They have the capacity to breathe life into our
				rights.”</p>

			</p>
			<p>Almost any opinion on abortion would have attracted national attention, yet Reeves’s opinion has stirred a striking amount of controversy at every step of the
				<i>Dobbs</i>
				case’s journey. It has drawn an appeals-court rebuke as
				<a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/Opinions/pub/18/18-60868-CV0.pdf">“deeply disquieting”</a>
				and
				<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-1392/148156/20200720160750082_19-1392%20Amicus%20Brief.pdf">a legal brief</a>
				from 18 states urging the Supreme Court to “condemn” the judge’s “rhetoric.” That rhetoric, though, has put before the justices issues that could shape the outcome of
				<i>Dobbs</i>, the fate of
				<i>Roe</i>, the response of states to the Supreme Court’s ruling, and the struggle between judges and legislators to determine the law of the land.</p>
			<p class="dropcap">U<span class="smallcaps">nder current law,</span>
				<i>Dobbs</i>
				is an easy case. In
				<i>Roe</i>
				and, almost two decades later,
				<i>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</i>, the Court ruled that states cannot ban abortions before “viability” of the fetus—about 23 to 24 weeks—making Mississippi’s 15-week cutoff clearly unconstitutional. Reeves ruled as much and then asked an obvious question: “So, why are we here?”</p>
			<p>Rejecting sophistry from the state’s legislators that the ban wasn’t really a “ban,” Reeves revealed the truth as he saw it: The state
				<a href="https://casetext.com/case/jackson-womens-health-org-v-currier-7">passed a law</a>
				“it knew was unconstitutional to endorse a decades-long campaign … to ask the Supreme Court to overturn
				<i>Roe v. Wade</i>.” He then scolded the lawmakers for pretending to care about women’s health and the well-being of the unborn and people of color while having the nation’s highest infant-mortality rate, tolerating “alarming” poverty and
				maternal-death rates, and curtailing health-care programs such as Medicaid. He accused legislators of perpetuating “the old Mississippi,” the one that didn’t allow women to serve on juries until 1968, the one that systematically sterilized Black
				women—getting a “Mississippi appendectomy,” it was called—and the one that, in 1984, became the last state to guarantee women the right to vote. He recounted Mississippi’s long history of denying its citizens’ constitutional rights with segregated
				schools, prohibitions on same-sex marriage, and a “secret intelligence arm” that enforced racial discrimination. Far from helping women and minorities, Reeves wrote, the state still seemed “bent on controlling” them.</p>
			<p>Few federal judges, if any, have ever said such things, not in an opinion and not with that kind of scathing bluntness. That Reeves said them—that he drew on Mississippi’s heartbreaking history to call out its hypocrisy—is at once remarkable and
				unsurprising. He has done it time and again, in

			</figure>
			<p>Born in 1964, Reeves grew up in Yazoo City, Mississippi, a Delta town where the cops were called on his father for objecting when a white grocer insulted his mother. To see a Saturday-afternoon movie, he had to mount urine-scented balcony stairs,
				because only white kids could afford the extra 50 cents for the cushioned seats below. “In Yazoo, you knew your place,” he told me. As a student in the first integrated public-school class in Mississippi, Reeves did well by any measure, but
				nonetheless suffered what he sees as racial abuse, including being whacked with a paddle 25 times by a white school administrator, who Reeves says falsely accused him of giving a girl the finger. “That man beat hell out of me,” Reeves said, adding
				that the memory still brings tears to his eyes, “and I have never come to forgive him for that.”</p>
			<p>With three sisters—one now a banker, another a correctional officer, a third an executive assistant—and a mother who washed and folded laundry at the Yazoo Motel to support her seven children, Reeves developed deep respect for the strength of
				women and all that they endure. In 2010, he became the second African American appointed a federal judge in Mississippi, taking the seat once held by Harold Cox, who referred to Black people in his courtroom as “baboons” and “chimpanzees.” Reeves
				told me he felt an obligation to the people accustomed to seeing court as a “hostile place, foreign soil,” and, with him, expected a very different face of justice.</p>
			<p>“I want to be speaking to the general public,” said Reeves, now a 57-year-old man of powerful bulk, broad grins, and soft hellos. “They have been taught a false narrative for generations, on same-sex marriage, on race, on the issues that affect
				the broader community.” Recounting history, he says, is one way to help Mississippians understand the truth.</p>

			</p>
			<p>On abortion, he has provoked morality-fueled indignation. Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed his decision, James Ho, among the court’s most outspoken and conservative judges, took offense at Reeves’s criticism of the
				anti-abortion movement’s claims to protect women and Black people. Ho cited surveys, articles, and legal briefs ostensibly proving that many if not most women have long viewed abortion as “women’s oppression” and an “injustice against female life.”
				He then relied heavily on a 2019 concurring opinion, by Justice Clarence Thomas, that condemned abortion as a “tool of modern-day eugenics,” used throughout American history to draw “the distinction between the fit and the unfit … along racial
				lines.” History, Ho concluded, haunts abortion-rights proponents “with the taint of racism.”</p>
			<p>The judge largely missed Reeves’s point—Mississippi can’t credibly proclaim a desire to help women and African Americans when it hinders them in so many ways—and Ho’s history was off as well.</p>
			<p>The pro-women argument began as a public-relations ploy. Escalating attacks on abortion clinics in the 1980s and early 1990s earned abortion opponents a reputation as violently hostile to women at a time of rising gender equality. As the Yale law
				professor Reva Siegel explains in a
				<a

				<i>Casey</i>
				decision, much more than
				<i>Roe</i>, stressed protecting women as equal citizens, a perspective reinforced by Bill Clinton’s election several months later as the first clearly pro-choice president. The anti-abortion movement’s (uniformly male) leaders saw the problem, did
				some market research, and concluded, “We’ve got to go out and sing from the housetops about what we’re doing—how compassionate we are to women, how we are helping women—not just babies, but also women,” the anti-abortion activist Jack Willke wrote in
				1997. What followed, according to Siegel, was a raft of studies, books, and talking points about how abortion supposedly led to trauma, sterility, and cancer and why the health, welfare, and happiness of women and the unborn are inextricably linked.
				Amid intense lobbying, many conservative lawmakers got the message, using pro-women claims to justify enacting laws like Mississippi’s.</p>
			<p>The history of abortions and eugenics is a bit more complicated. Tracing it back to the nation’s earliest days, Melissa Murray, a law professor at NYU, recounts in
				<a href="https://harvardlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/134-Harv.-L.-Rev.-2025.pdf">a 2021 article</a>
				how both sides of the abortion debate have at some point used race to support their positions. When Congress banned importing slaves in 1807, slaveholders tried to preserve their workforce by prohibiting abortions. After the Civil War, anxious that
				birth rates were dropping for white people but rising for immigrants and people of color, many states declared abortion a crime. This effort to keep America white—in essence, to “improve” its stock—grew in the early 1900s along with interest in
				eugenics.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile, feminists began demanding control over when they became pregnant, with Margaret Sanger leading the push for accessible birth control. Yet, according to Murray, Sanger’s calls for contraception as a way to ensure enjoyable sex offended
				the more chaste feminist mainstream, pushing her to ally with the popular eugenics movement to save her campaign. Critics of abortion—later including Justice Thomas—claimed that the connection was proof of abortion’s use as a eugenics tool, but in
				fact Sanger opposed abortion and never thought of it that way.</p>
			<p>Yet suspicion that contraception led to “race suicide,” as the 1930s Black nationalist Marcus Garvey called it, took hold in the 1960s and ’70s among groups like the Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam, which opposed abortion and contraception
				as threats to Black survival. That stance put these male-dominated organizations at odds with female members and other Black women, who were far more concerned about access to birth control and abortion while facing the prospect of raising children
				under sometimes impossible conditions. Justice Thomas—and Judge Ho—see an abortion rate among Black people that is
				<a href="https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2017.304042">nearly three times as high</a>
				as that of white people as evidence of eugenics rather than a reflection of life under those conditions.</p>
			<p>With his opinion’s errant history and incendiary judgments, Ho drew even more attention to Reeves’s criticisms, increasing the chances that they and the backlash against them will factor into the outcome of
				<i>Dobbs</i>, the reaction of the states, and the power of federal judges. We may know better after tomorrow what the justices are thinking, but here’s how things might play out.</p>
			<p>The Supreme Court said it will focus on one issue: Can states ban abortions before viability? The betting among many experts is that the Court will decide they can—maybe drawing a clear but somewhat arbitrary line (as many European countries have
				done) at, say, Mississippi’s 15 weeks—but otherwise technically preserving
				<i>Casey</i>
				and
				<i>Roe</i>. That would probably mean a state could regulate abortions after 15 weeks, as long as it did not put an “undue burden” on women’s ability to end their pregnancies. But how to determine when a burden is undue?</p>
			<p>A
				<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/15pdf/15-274_new_e18f.pdf">2016 Supreme Court</a>
				decision,
				<i>Whole Women’s Health v. Hellerstedt</i>, said judges must examine and balance the
				<i>actual</i>
				benefits of an abortion regulation—not just take the state’s word for it—against the obstacles it creates for women. An unjustifiable regulation would never fly, nor would one that essentially blocked abortion. In a 2020
				<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/18-1323_c07d.pdf">decision</a>, the Court struck down a regulation almost identical to the one considered in
				<i>Hellerstedt</i>. But in a concurring opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts joined dissenting justices in saying that judges
				<i>should</i>
				essentially take a state’s word for it—or risk wading into politics, the realm of legislatures. So even a bogus rule might pass muster if it didn’t ban abortions. But Reeves’s opinion raises the counterargument, highlighting the dangers to democracy
				if judges stand aside while legislators deceive voters and make law on the basis of nonsense. Don’t be surprised if the issue comes up in oral arguments.</p>
			<p>There’s also a chance that the Supreme Court will overturn
				<i>Roe</i>—as Mississippi has asked it to do—if not in
				<i>Dobbs</i>, then in another case soon. As Murray argues, one way to do it would be through the eugenics argument championed by Thomas. The Court doesn’t erase time-honored precedents just because most justices think they’re improper—and plenty of
				justices have said that
				<i>Roe</i>
				was wrongly decided. The Court needs what Murray calls a “special justification,” and for the right to abortion, that could be racial discrimination. Race provided a reason for overruling precedent in landmark decisions such as
				<i>Brown v. Board of Education</i>
				and, just last year,
				<i>Ramos v. Louisiana</i>, which declared non-unanimous juries in criminal cases unconstitutional. The argument that abortion is rooted in racist eugenics has been cited in several briefs filed in the
				<i>Dobbs</i>
				case, and might sway this Court, with its 6–3 conservative majority. Thomas could well air it during tomorrow’s arguments.</p>
			<p>If Reeves is right, though—if phony justifications should not carry the day in challenges to state laws—surely the same holds true for attempts to overturn constitutional rights. Mississippi lawmakers, Clarence Thomas, and their anti-abortion
				allies have done enough damage by encouraging Americans to question their sense of reality about abortion. It would be truly alarming if the Supreme Court were to fall for that kind of gaslighting too.</p>

				<p class="dropcap">S<span class="smallcaps">eventy years ago,</span>
					William F. Buckley Jr. published his keening lament for American higher education,
					<i>God and Man at Yale.</i>
					Chagrin pervaded
					<i>GAMAY,
					</i>as Buckley later branded the book, but it also stung in a satisfying way—a high-handed swat at the Ivy League by a debonair twerp who’d only recently graduated.
					<i>GAMAY
					</i>has since inspired seven decades of tribute acts by more and less debonair conservatives.</p>
				<p>Then, just this month, the college administrator and Shakespeare scholar Pano Kanelos announced that he and a cadre of renegade ideologues are starting a school in Texas expressly to exorcise from academia the nameless ghosts that have spooked
					conservatives since
					<i>GAMAY</i>. The casting call seems to be for self-styled outlaws with lively online newsletters or massive fortunes, along with credible claims to having been canceled.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1951/11/the-attack-on-yale/306724/?utm_source=feed">Read: The attack on Yale</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>Buckley wouldn’t have qualified. He achieved blockbuster success, first with
					<i>GAMAY</i>, then with<i></i>some 60 other books; his long-running TV show,
					<i>Firing Line</i>; and
					<i>National Review,
					</i>which he founded in 1955. He was popular with the liberals of his caste, who loved to debate him (many won; see: James Baldwin). It’s hard to imagine he ever knew the anguish of so much as a Maidstone Club snubbing. Nor would he, in 1951, have
					stood with those who opposed diversity, political correctness, or “wokeness,” if only because the Yale of his time was almost uniformly white and eminently male, an institution that wouldn’t admit substantial numbers of Black men for another 15 years
					and women for another 20. The perceived persecution of white men and commitment to feminism and anti-racism that addle Buckley’s intellectual offspring didn’t touch him in the 1940s, as there were no other races or sexes at Yale to offend, mistreat,
					envy, or fear.
				</p>
				<p>I reread
					<i>GAMAY</i>
					this fall to try to understand why American universities so reliably disappoint conservatives, decade after decade after decade. Calling higher education possibly “the most fractured institution” in “broken” America, Kanelos, in his manifesto for the
					University of Austin (UATX), slags off every other college as a finishing school. “Historians will study how we arrived at this tragic pass,” he concludes. And though it’s presumably premature to play historian to the tragic pass of November 2021, I
					figured Kanelos’s tragic pass would bear at least a passing resemblance to the numberless tragic passes at colleges confronted by reactionaries before him. I thought that
					<i>GAMAY
					</i>would contain, if not the first-ever tragic pass—the Eden of tragic passes—at least a kernel of the unceasing heartbreak delivered to so many right-wing college graduates by colleges. I imagined I’d find a pedagogic program in Buckley’s book that
					would speak to Kanelos and all the others affronted by the nation’s finishing schools. I did not.</p>
				<p>Buckley’s notion of what students and alumni needed from mid-century colleges is nowhere in the literature for the new UATX. Kanelos mentions “students” in his manifesto only to ticket them for terrorizing conservative faculty. Unlike Buckley, who
					dabbled in anti-intellectualism, Kanelos is squarely on the side of the professoriate. His concern is for heterodox professors to whom students object; Buckley’s concern is for students who object to heterodox professors. Seven decades after
					<i>GAMAY</i>
					warned readers that colleges were failing to inculcate orthodoxy in their students, conservatives now fear they’re doing so only too effectively. They’re just worried it’s the wrong orthodoxy.</p>
				<p class="dropcap">B<span class="smallcaps">uckley—the devoutly Roman</span>
					<span class="smallcaps">Catholic</span>, homeschooled polyglot son of a globe-trotting oil wildcatter who grew up largely in Mexico and Paris and learned English in London as a third language—was just too different from most American college
					students, conservative and otherwise, then and now, to share an animus with them. His nemeses at college were his own: Yale professors who did not affirm “a belief in Jesus Christ as God and Saviour”—Buckley favored Anglo orthography—and anyone who
					mentioned the economist John Maynard Keynes.</p>
				<p>Buckley seemed sincere in this.
					<i>Heresy</i>
					in
					<i>GAMAY
					</i>does not describe stock right-wing positions on immigration or trans politics, which are evidently warmly welcomed at UATX.
					<i>Heresy</i>, to Buckley, meant
					<i>heresy</i>. Buckley was shocked, he wrote, to find that many on the Yale faculty—including the Jewish scholars Paul Weiss and Robert Cohen—were not catechizably Christian and willing to go full Nicene from the podium. (Buckley especially worried
					that caustic asides, such as Weiss’s statement that “Christ was a minor prophet,” might shake the Christian faith of Yalies.) Buckley boldly proposed to “narrow the existing orthodoxy” at Yale, and make sure that Christianity was “championed and
					promulgated on every level and at every opportunity” on campus. It’s hard to convey just how eccentric a book
					<i>GAMAY
					</i>is, but I’ll give it a shot.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/failed-school-ban-evolution-conservatives/620779/?utm_source=feed">Read: The conservative war on education that failed</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>This desire to re-center Christian doctrine in the Yale curriculum is only the first weirdness of
					<i>GAMAY.</i>
					In the book’s second section, Buckley calls out lectures and textbooks in which Keynes (as much a meme as an economist, then as now) gets a hearing he considers too robust. Buckley had no beef with the study of evolutionary biology, which often set
					off 20th-century Christians, but he was anxious that professorial support for “interventionist solutions to economic problems” would crush the enterprising spirit of young American men. Buckley thus rejected #Keynes in favor of what he considered the
					implicit ideology of Gold Rush miners, who, in the words of a Yale dean whom Buckley admired, “formed the vanguard of the vast and colonial movement which increased immeasurably the health and strength of the country.” This elevation of the 49ers as
					a Yale beau ideal might be intriguing, except that precious few 19th-century adventurers had been to college. Maybe—as some in Silicon Valley have proposed—the best way to create a college for the entrepreneurial vanguard really is to abolish it
					altogether.</p>
				<p>Buckley was just 25 when he wrote
					<i>GAMAY</i>, and it’s shot through with underproofed righteousness. It’s a delight anyway. In it are traces of the imperiousness that became Buckley’s stock in trade. Lockjaw is almost audible in the prose, and of course gall, as Buckley, who at the
					time lacked all scholarly, political, or literary achievement, staked a claim to a wide intellectual terrain. This time around,
					<i>GAMAY</i>
					struck me as not a polemic but a perverse anti-bildungsroman<i>,
					</i>the story of a young man, utterly unwilling to learn, who sees himself as a native-born executive and his instructors as woefully underperforming employees.</p>
				<p>He inspired a legion of successors, mostly college-educated men who made their names denouncing liberal arts as too liberal, including Allan Bloom (University of Chicago, 1949), David Horowitz (Columbia University, 1959), Roger Kimball (Bennington
					College, 1976), Heather Mac Donald (Yale, 1978), Dinesh D’Souza (Dartmouth College, 1983), Peter Thiel (Stanford University, 1989), Jonathan Haidt (University of Pennsylvania, 1992), Mary Katharine Ham (University of Georgia, 2002), Ben Shapiro
					(UCLA, 2004), and Charlie Kirk (Wheeling High School, 2012). But they are tilting at different windmills. Kanelos cites approvingly Yale’s recent commitment “to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable”—a
					program that would have appalled Buckley, with his bold intention to narrow Yale’s existing orthodoxy to nothing but the supremely mentionable Christian doctrine.</p>
				<p>If conservatives who have Chicken Littled about higher education for 70 years don’t share an ideology, what do they share? Easy: career ambitions and superb trolling reflexes. Buckley’s prose, as Michael Lee wrote in 2010, was “gladiatorial,”
					reflecting a “flashy, combative style whose ultimate aim is the creation of inflammatory drama.” Reading the work of today’s conservatives, or hearing their disquisitions on Fox News, it’s hard to imagine that the right-wing idiom ever had any other
					aim.</p>
				<p>If Buckleyism failed as a philosophy of education, it succeeded beyond measure as an aesthetic. Inflammatory drama now abounds. We await the historian who will one day comprehensively mourn all the tragic passes. And American colleges truck on.
					Last year, 46,905 people applied to Yale; only 2,169 were admitted. I looked to the current list of best sellers about higher education to find the latest critiques of college as apocalyptically liberal. But the list was dominated by titles about
					getting in.</p>

				<p class="dropcap">
					<span class="smallcaps">Mike Pence spent much</span>
					of his vice presidency quietly catering to the whims of President Donald Trump. But on January 6, he broke with Trump by refusing to overturn the 2020 election results. And now, Pence is eyeing a presidential run of his own, even though his old boss
					hasn’t ruled out a 2024 campaign. Pence wouldn’t necessarily stay out of the race even if Trump jumps in.</p>
				<p>“If you know the Pences, you know they’ll always try to discern where they’re being called to serve,” Marc Short, Pence’s former chief of staff, told me. “And I don’t think that is dependent on who else is in or not in the race.”</p>
				<p>A 2024 Pence campaign looks futile no matter the scenario. If Trump runs, he’ll rally the same MAGA zealots who refuse to believe he lost the last election. And if Trump opts out, Pence isn’t his natural successor; he may have spoiled any hope of
					inheriting the Republican base when he defied Trump on January 6. Scanning the Republican universe, it’s hard to detect a glimmer of a Pence-for-president movement of any sort. Which leaves GOP operatives asking a version of the same question: What
					in the world is Mike Pence thinking?</p>
				<p>Sarah Longwell is an anti-Trump Republican strategist who has led dozens of focus groups since the 2020 election with hard-core Trump voters, reluctant Trump voters, and 2016 Trump voters who switched to Joe Biden last year. “Pence doesn’t do well
					with anybody,” she told me. People make faces when she mentions Pence’s name, faces that convey a collective
					<em>nah.
					</em>Or maybe
					<em>meh</em>, she said, thinking it over. But the impression they leave is obvious enough, she added: “Not interested.”</p>
				<p>As of this point, Pence hasn’t decided whether to run, his advisers say. For now, he’s focused on helping Republicans win back congressional majorities in the 2022 midterm elections. But he’s also making the sorts of moves that typically precede a
					presidential bid. Since leaving office on January 20, he’s been showing up in states that hold early presidential contests: New Hampshire, South Carolina, and Iowa. Next month he’s set to return to New Hampshire for a Republican fundraising event.
					He’s writing a book and has started a podcast,
					<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/american-freedom-with-mike-pence/id1585706116">
						<em>American Freedom</em>
					</a>, that is a platform to reintroduce himself to voters after four years as Trump’s mostly subservient No. 2. Speaking in a flat baritone, the erstwhile talk-radio host mixes treacly odes to public service with sharp critiques of Biden’s record.
					One episode devoted to the 20th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks opens with Pence denouncing “the failed leadership of the Biden administration” and closes with a vignette of him and other lawmakers singing “God Bless America” on the
					steps of the U.S. Capitol after the attacks.</p>

				</p>
				<p>“I will tell you, on that day and in the weeks and months that followed, there were no Republicans in Washington, D.C.,” Pence tells his listeners. “There were no Democrats in Washington, D.C. It was just Americans. Everybody rolled up their
					sleeves and did what needed to be done.” (Left unsaid is that he later abetted a president who politicized virtually every random bit of human experience, including wearing a
					<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/dangerous-disrespectful-doctors-tear-pence-s-mask-less-hospital-visit-n1195611">mask</a>
					and watching a
					<a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/2018/10/08/mike-pence-nfl-walkout-stunt-taxpayers">football game</a>, and who stirred up the insurrectionists before what was perhaps the most unsettling day on U.S. soil since 9/11.)</p>
				<p>Former Vice President Dan Quayle
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/07/mike-pences-campaign-plans-for-2020and-2024/613909/?utm_source=feed">has told me</a>
					that he advised Pence back in 2012 that if he wanted to run for president, the Indiana governor’s office would be a better springboard than Congress. (Pence campaigned for the statehouse office that year and won.) A cold-eyed political calculus
					suggests that 2024 would be Pence’s best and maybe last real shot. He’ll be 65 by the next inauguration, and fresher faces are emerging in Republican politics, notably Glenn Youngkin, the incoming Virginia governor who won a state that Biden had
					captured a year ago by 10 points. “Someone like Glenn Youngkin is the future,” Sarah Chamberlain, the president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, a group that promotes centrist policies, told me. “He would be a wonderful presidential
					candidate.”</p>
				<p>Still, Pence has been mulling a presidential run for years, and such ambitions aren’t easily quashed. He remains in demand for GOP fundraising and campaign events, a means to cement alliances. Some Republicans see a rationale for Pence’s potential
					candidacy built on his conservative credentials.</p>

				</p>
				<p>Pence’s chances in the ’24 race brighten if Trump stays out. Right now, Trump is sounding like a candidate, though some people who have worked with him suspect he’ll ultimately stand down. “Trump won’t run,” John Kelly, who was Trump’s
					longest-serving chief of staff, told me. “He’ll continue talking about it; he may even declare, but he will not run. And the reason is he simply cannot be seen as a loser.” John Bolton, who was Trump’s former national security adviser,
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/11/trump-2024-gop-ticket/620755/?utm_source=feed">predicted</a>
					much the same thing.</p>
				<p>Whatever Trump’s future, for Pence to be competitive in a Republican presidential primary race, he’d need to assemble a coalition of fellow evangelical Christians, cultural conservatives, and a chunk of mainstream Republicans who appreciate that
					he upheld Biden’s victory. Pence’s apostasy on January 6 drew Trump’s ire, but his actions that day helped preserve the notion that voters pick the winners. Is anyone willing to give him credit? Perhaps, but it’s also a fair bet those who might do so
					still resent Pence for obliging Trump through years of chaos.</p>
				<p>It’s hard not to see Pence as the author of his own misfortune. Listening to his podcast, one hears a politician who sounds like a throwback to a pre-Trump era. He criticizes the Biden administration for “one crisis after another” though the
					twice-impeached Trump presided over the lengthiest
					<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/01/25/trump-shutdown-announcement-1125529">government shutdown</a>
					in history and a pandemic. Pence
					<em>tsk</em>-<em>tsk</em>s about graffiti scrawled on a federal building in Portland, Oregon, without mentioning that the insurrectionists spread feces through the halls of the U.S. Capitol.</p>
				<p>Trump dismantled the Republican Party and remade it into a vehicle for his own promotion. Pence enabled that makeover. Yet he is now acting as if the old establishment party that gave rise to Bob Dole and Howard Baker is still intact and his to
					reclaim.</p>
				<p>“He stood by while the party was actively changed by Trump, and now it’s not interested in politicians like him anymore,” Longwell said.</p>
				<p>What, then, is Pence thinking? Maybe that if a former reality-TV star can upend the laws of politics and become president, so can he.</p>
				<p>Pence is “one of the most likable people in either party,” Mick Mulvaney, another former Trump White House chief of staff, told me. And yet: “What is Mike Pence offering that 15 other people aren’t offering—other than having been vice president,
					which I’m not sure is very compelling these days.”</p>

			<content type="html">
				<p>Andrew Cuomo’s resignation as governor of New York might have been a godsend for CNN. The network faced a nearly intractable conflict of interest: The governor was a major national figure, but his brother, Chris, was also one of CNN’s prime-time
					stars. Instead, the fallout from Andrew Cuomo’s departure has made Chris Cuomo’s position untenable. He should resign; if he doesn’t, CNN should sack him.</p>
				<p>On Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2021/08/what-did-andrew-cuomo-think-would-happen/619658/?utm_source=feed">investigation into sexual-harassment complaints</a>
					against the Democratic governor precipitated his August resignation,
					<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/additional-transcripts-exhibits-and-videos-independent-investigation-sexual">released new documents</a>
					that show how Chris mixed his roles as brother and broadcaster. The documents show that he was engaged in passing information to a top aide to the governor, Melissa DeRosa, as his brother’s team scrambled to respond to accusations. “I have a lead on
					the wedding girl,” he texted DeRosa, referring to a woman who complained that Andrew had made an unwanted advance at a wedding.</p>
				<p>“When asked, I would reach out to sources, other journalists, to see if they had heard of anybody else coming out,” Chris
					<a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.07.15_christopher_cuomo_cleary_11.24.2021_0.pdf">explained in an interview</a>
					with the attorney general’s office. He said he had only been seeking info about whether other complaints against his brother were forthcoming, not trying to dig up dirt on accusers. “I would never do oppo research on anybody alleging anything like
					this. I’m not in the oppo research business.”</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/americas-andrew-cuomo-problem/618184/?utm_source=feed">David A. Graham: America’s Andrew Cuomo problem</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>This is not the first revelation about Chris Cuomo’s flawed handling of the scandal. Long before the allegations against Andrew, CNN had tried to find a finely sliced solution: Chris wouldn’t cover his brother’s travails on air, and he could
					confer with his brother on a personal basis, but he shouldn’t deal with the governor’s staff.
					<em>The Washington Post
					</em>
					<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/chris-cuomo-andrew-cuomo/2021/05/20/99579382-b7f9-11eb-bb84-6b92dedcd8ed_story.html">reported</a>
					in May, however that Chris had participated in meetings with staff members. He apologized on air, and CNN issued a statement saying, “It was inappropriate to engage in conversations that included members of the Governor’s staff, which Chris
					acknowledges,” but that he had not been disciplined.</p>
				<p>The new revelations demonstrate more serious errors of judgment. When Chris Cuomo simply offered advice to staff members, he failed to observe the rules CNN had set for his private behavior. But by gathering information from “sources” and passing
					it to his brother’s staff, Cuomo committed the more egregious step of directly mixing the journalistic work of calling sources and gathering information with his personal, familial commitments. He was wise not to go further into the realm of “oppo
					research,” but he still went far beyond the bounds of propriety.</p>
				<p>Perhaps few can blame Chris Cuomo for being “family first, job second,”
					<a href="https://twitter.com/CuomoPrimeTime/status/1395557649865973762">as he said in May</a>. “Being a journalist and a brother to a politician is unique, and a unique challenge, and I have a unique responsibility to balance those roles.” Whether
					that balance was ever truly achievable is debatable, but the conflict between the roles eventually became irreconcilable. He could have chosen to step down from his job to back his brother, or he could have chosen to distance himself from the scandal
					and commit to journalism. Instead, he tried to have it both ways. In using his journalistic skills and access to aid his brother, Cuomo broke trust with his employers and, more important, his audience.</p>
				<p>CNN bears some of the blame. For years, the network banned Chris Cuomo from interviewing his brother, a commonsense precaution. But in the spring of 2020, as the coronavirus ravaged the country, Andrew Cuomo presented himself as a competent
					counterpart to Donald Trump’s pandemic bungling. CNN, knowing ratings gold when it saw it, decided to put the brothers on air together, apparently concluding that the rules mattered less in the midst of a crisis.</p>

				</p>
				<p>The exchanges between them were entertaining—lots of brotherly jibes about who was the favorite child and who hadn’t called Mom recently—and sometimes poignant, as when Chris fell sick with COVID-19 and interviewed Andrew from basement isolation.
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/cnns-cuomo-no-no/612103/?utm_source=feed">Journalistically, however, the shtick was appalling, as I wrote in May 2020</a>. Rather than ask tough questions of his brother, Chris grilled him on
					whether he’d run for president. Again, no reasonable person would expect Chris to hold his own brother’s feet to the fire. The mistake was allowing them on air together in the first place. The puffy news coverage helped make Andrew Cuomo a liberal
					hero (briefly) and also helped obscure the serious shortcomings of New York’s pandemic response, including deaths in nursing homes that the governor tried to cover up. As it turned out, the rules mattered even more in a crisis, when watchdog
					journalism could be literally a matter of life and death.</p>
				<p>Just like the coronavirus, karma is highly transmissible. The adoring coverage of Andrew Cuomo fueled a backlash against his long-standing bullying. A legislator who’d challenged him over COVID-19 said the governor had threatened to “destroy” him.
					Soon after, a former aide
					<a href="https://lindseyboylan4ny.medium.com/my-story-of-working-with-governor-cuomo-e664d4814b4e">publicly aired</a>
					allegations of sexual harassment, which were quickly followed by many more. The process took a few months, but Andrew Cuomo’s fate was sealed. (Chris Cuomo has faced his own allegations of sexual harassment. A former colleague at ABC
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/opinion/chris-cuomo-cnn.html">wrote in a
					</a>
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/opinion/chris-cuomo-cnn.html">

					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/opinion/chris-cuomo-cnn.html">column</a>
					in September that he had groped her in 2005. Cuomo acknowledged and apologized at the time of the incident and again when the column was published.)</p>
				<p>When he was advising his brother earlier this year, Chris Cuomo encouraged Andrew to dismiss calls for his resignation as “cancel culture,” and perhaps he will take the same view against calls for his own resignation. But the defense doesn’t stick
					here. Hosting a prime-time television show is a privilege, not a right. Chris Cuomo doesn’t need to be drummed out of journalism, but he does need to face repercussions. By keeping Cuomo on the air and in his job, CNN would send the message that
					journalistic ethics are only for the little people and viewers are on their own. Cuomo should take some time off and reflect on his chosen profession—and if and when he comes back, perhaps he should choose a new beat.</p>

			<content type="html">
				<p>The coronavirus is flying
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/27/world/africa/omicron-covid-greek-alphabet.html">through the Greek alphabet</a>. On Friday, the World Health Organization designated Omicron a “variant of concern”—spooking stock markets and triggering a new
					round of international travel bans. Today, President Joe Biden echoed the WHO’s language, calling Omicron a “cause for concern,” but warned Americans not to panic.</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/omicron-coronavirus-variant-what-we-know/620827/?utm_source=feed">Little is known about the variant so far</a>, my colleague Katherine J. Wu says. We caught up with Katie to discuss what we
					<i>do
					</i>know about the variant (which is pronounced
					<i>OH-mi-cron
					</i>or
					<i>AH-mi-cron</i>, if you were wondering) and what to watch for in the coming weeks.</p>
				<p>
					<i>The conversation that follows has been edited and condensed for clarity.</i>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>1. What do—and don’t—we know about this variant right now?
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>We have the genetic sequence, and we know that there are more than 30 mutations in the gene that codes for
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/spike-protein-vaccines-covid/618954/?utm_source=feed">the spike protein</a>. But we don’t know if the mutations are significant. And we just don’t have a lot of data to go off of. We have
					<a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Implications-emergence-spread-SARS-CoV-2%20B.1.1.529-variant-concern-Omicron-for-the-EU-EEA-Nov2021.pdf">all these hypotheses based on the sequence</a>, but that’s not real-world data yet.</p>
				<p>Scientists are still looking at three things: whether this variant actually spreads faster than others, whether it’s evading immune responses, and whether it causes more serious disease than other variants. We’ll know more by the middle-to-end of
					December.</p>
				<p>
					<b>2. Do the current vaccines work against Omicron?
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>We haven’t confirmed that yet. But even if this variant can evade some of the antibodies that vaccinated people produce, it is extraordinarily unlikely for this variant—or any other variant—to completely escape the vaccinated immune response. We
					are not going to completely plummet to zero protection.</p>
				<p>
					<b>3. Do fully vaccinated Americans need to take any additional precautions?</b>
				</p>
				<p>A good move now is to get a booster and make sure that we’re really paying attention to all those other measures we know are important—masking, distancing, paying attention to ventilation, and getting tested when you feel sick or think you’ve been
					exposed.</p>
				<p>
					<b>4. What about the unvaccinated?</b>
				</p>
				<p>This virus has shown over and over again that it is not going to play nicely with people who are unvaccinated. It’s also worth keeping in mind that leaving a large proportion of the population unvaccinated—whether that’s on a community level or a
					country level or global level—<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/3-principles-now-define-pandemic/619336/?utm_source=feed">is actually how we get more variants like this</a>.</p>
				<p>Getting vaccinated is not just protecting you from sickness. It’s starving the virus of opportunities to transform into something that could pose more harm to us.</p>
				<p>
					<b>5. Could Omicron trigger another Delta-style surge in the United States, just in time for the holidays?
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>It’s really too early to speculate. We just don’t know enough about this variant. One thing to keep in mind is that what a virus does depends at least as much on us as the virus itself. We could totally forestall the nightmare situation. Is a
					surge possible? Yes. Is it also preventable? Absolutely.</p>
				<p>I’m certainly thinking about how I can make my holiday plans as safe as possible. That doesn’t mean I’m canceling everything. But I’m thinking about stuff like,
					<i>Where do I
					</i>need<i>
						to travel?</i>
					<i>Am I going to have enough tests handy?</i>
					I’m just going through my checklist extra carefully.</p>
				<p>
					<b>6. What does this mean for the global fight against the virus?</b>
				</p>
				<p>This really highlights how important vaccine equity is. Something that affects one person in a global, interconnected community is ultimately going to affect everyone when the threat is infectious. We need to try to level the playing field—to make
					sure that people around the world have equal access to resources to protect themselves against this virus.</p>
				<p>
					<b>7. How much should we be panicking right now?
					</b>
				</p>
				<p>Not at all. It’s never time to panic. It’s counterproductive. Reacting wisely and reacting sensibly and using the tools we have is always the best move.</p>
				<p>Don’t panic. Just pay attention. Try to keep your thinking about where the pandemic is going flexible—because it could go in any other direction still.</p>

				<p class="dropcap">A<span class="smallcaps">mid all the attention</span>
					paid to the legal drama surrounding both Mississippi’s and Texas’s contested abortion laws, one striking detail seems to have escaped much notice: Neither state makes an exception for rape or incest.
				</p>
				<p>This is a major departure, a sign of how extreme America’s abortion politics have become. For decades, exceptions to abortion bans for rape and incest were a rare source of consensus.</p>
				<p>And they still are, among the public: Time and again,
					<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx">Gallup</a>
					has found that nearly 80 percent of Americans support such exceptions. This is true even in red states such as
					<a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/5/18/18630562/alabama-abortion-ban-voters-exemption-for-rape-incest">Alabama</a>
					and
					<a href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3822">Texas</a>. Yet these exceptions are now vanishing.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/texas-abortion-law-will-make-patients-suffer/619997/?utm_source=feed">Chavi Eve Karkowsky: Another extremist law that Americans have to live with</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>The reason is power. Many anti-abortion activists never believed that a rape or incest exception could be squared with their deeply held belief that a fetus is a person. Today the anti-abortion movement is ready to ask for what it wants, and the
					GOP—and its allies on the Supreme Court—is willing to give it to them. What the movement wants, now as in the past, is the recognition of fetal personhood. And historically, recognizing personhood has often meant criminalizing the behavior of
					pregnant women, even when those women are victims of crimes themselves.
				</p>
				<p class="dropcap">T<span class="smallcaps">he story of rape</span>
					and incest exceptions began in the late 1950s, when the elite American Law Institute, a nonpartisan group of lawyers, scholars, and judges that proposed legal reforms, considered reforming criminal abortion laws. At the time, most states criminalized
					all abortions unless continuing a pregnancy would threaten a person’s life. The ALI proposed a broader group of exceptions: for threats to patient health, certain fetal abnormalities, and rape and incest.</p>
				<p>The ALI could easily justify most of these exceptions as codifications of best medical practice, but rape and incest were different. There, the ALI suggested, the concern was not physical health but the
					<a href="https://www.illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ziegler.pdf">“anxiety and shame”</a>
					of people who were pregnant through no will of their own. Allowing abortions for people who had had consensual sex, ALI’s leaders suggested, would be “<a href="https://www.illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ziegler.pdf">an invitation to promiscuity</a>.” But the ALI’s framers had no such concerns about victims of incest and sexual assault.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/anti-abortion-movement-sb-8/620586/?utm_source=feed">Mary Ziegler: The anti-abortion movement will win even if it loses</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>In the 1960s, states began enacting the ALI provisions. Rape and incest exceptions were broadly supported, but the early anti-abortion movement opposed them. Some critics of the exceptions insisted that “real rape” almost never resulted in
					pregnancy—and that women would
					<a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/glj49&amp;amp;div=30&amp;amp;id=&amp;amp;page=">lie to take advantage</a>
					of an exception. Mostly, the movement rejected the exception because it conflicted with the idea that a fetus was a rights-holding
					<a href="https://www.illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ziegler.pdf">person</a>.</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18">
						<i>Roe v. Wade</i>
					</a>, which struck down abortion restrictions as unconstitutional, made the ALI provisions obsolete. But in the decades since, as right-to-lifers pushed a never-ending array of incremental restrictions on the procedure and chipped away at
					<i>Roe</i>, rape and incest exceptions remained a touchstone of the abortion debate. Supporters of abortion rights fought to include rape and incest exceptions in the
					<a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121402281">Hyde Amendment</a>, which bans Medicaid funding for abortion.</p>
				<p>Embracing the exceptions became a rite of passage for the GOP’s standard-bearers. George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, Mitt Romney, and
					<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/19/politics/trump-abortion-ban-rape-incest/index.html">Donald Trump</a>
					declared their
					<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-on-abortion-a-matter-of-exception/2012/08/22/39f7f26c-ec9f-11e1-a80b-9f898562d010_story.html">support</a>
					for such exceptions. Their reasons were not hard to see: The exception was widely supported, even among Republicans in deeply conservative states.</p>
				<p>The most fervent anti-abortion activists felt differently. They never liked the exceptions, but they came to tolerate them. That was because until recent years, the anti-abortion movement had a plan: to win over as many Americans as possible, to
					make moderate Republicans comfortable working with them, and to maximize the chances of success before the Supreme Court. Fighting against rape and incest exceptions was not an immediate priority.</p>
				<p>Moreover, these exceptions were rarely used. Sexual assault and incest were (and are) massively
					<a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/sexual-assault-remains-dramatically-underreported">underreported</a>; many survivors who did come forward were not believed. Sexual violence was common, but at least officially, few abortions were justified on the basis of
					<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/05/24/rape-and-incest-account-few-abortions-so-why-all-attention/1211175001/">rape or incest</a>. For anti-abortion advocates, convincing popular majorities took precedence over writing laws that would prevent abortions in all circumstances.</p>
				<p>Not anymore. Both the anti-abortion movement and the GOP have evolved, as has their relationship to each other. Some of this is about the Supreme Court. With six conservatives—including three Trump nominees—the Court seems poised to roll back
					abortion rights. Few anti-abortion activists are worried about building broad public support when they have a Court that looks willing to give them everything.</p>
				<p>Additionally, changes to campaign-finance rules have empowered donors, nonprofits, and super PACs that are further to the right. Noncompetitive districts and states have eliminated concerns for some Republicans about alienating voters. The new
					playbook, even before Trump took office, has focused on turning out the base, not building widespread appeal. As a result, there is little daylight between the GOP and the anti-abortion movement—including on the rape and incest exception.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/after-roe-legal-mess-future-abortion-rights/620134/?utm_source=feed">Read: The messy post-Roe legal future awaiting America</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>The anti-abortion movement—and with it the GOP—can now focus on the recognition of fetal personhood. If the Supreme Court eventually recognizes fetal personhood under the Fourteenth Amendment, that would make abortion unconstitutional nationwide.
					This will have implications well beyond the law of abortion.</p>
				<p class="dropcap">T<span class="smallcaps">hirty years ago,</span>
					at the intersection of the failed
					<a href="https://civilrights.org/edfund/resource/the-war-on-drugs-has-failed-commission-says/">War on Drugs</a>
					and congressional
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/welfare-reform-tanf-medicaid-food-stamps/552299/?utm_source=feed">attacks on welfare programs</a>, rhetoric about the “crack mom” and “welfare queen” converged. These types of “bad moms”
					neglected their children while getting high on drugs and sapping state resources. This stereotype was trafficked for political expedience and “tough on drugs” law enforcement. The effects included poor Black women being
					<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/WomensHealth/pregnant-shackled-women-bars-deliver-chains/story?id=11933376">shackled</a>
					during labor and delivery; Black women
					<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-08-07-tm-24470-story.html">being forcefully escorted</a>
					from hospitals shortly after giving birth, taken away while still bleeding from birth without the aid of a sanitary napkin; and pregnant Black women being seized in a chokehold while almost full-term.
				</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Anti-abortion groups also equated the bad behavior of pregnant patients with
					<a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1997-10-31-1997304026-story.html">child abuse</a>. In
					<a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-08-07-tm-24470-story.html">South Carolina</a>, Black women who took drugs while pregnant were charged with “distribution to minors and child neglect.” At the time, the Supreme Court seemed unwilling to reverse
					<i>Roe</i>, much less recognize fetal rights. So groups such as Americans United for Life set out to make
					<i>Roe</i>
					an outlier by recognizing fetal personhood in inheritance law, property law, personal-injury law, and
					<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/05/fetal-homicide-abortion-rights-restrictions/">even homicide law</a>. Treating pregnant patients as child abusers flowed from the logic of personhood.</p>
				<p>Today, the past is prologue. Those claiming to defend fetal personhood have imposed criminal and civil punishments on pregnant people. They have arrested pregnant women who refuse Cesarean
					<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mom-arrested-after-utah-stillbirth/">sections</a>
					or
					<a href="https://www.thegazette.com/news/iowa-woman-accused-of-trying-to-kill-unborn-baby-in-fall-down-stairs-charged-with-attempted-feticid/">fall down steps</a>;
					<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/08/18/world/americas/dominican-republic-abortion/index.html">denied chemotherapy</a>
					to a pregnant cancer patient; and
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/us/case-explores-rights-of-fetus-versus-mother.html">involuntarily committed pregnant women</a>
					for threatening the health of a fetus during pregnancy. In
					<a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/03/defense-attorneys-in-nashville-prosecutors-accused-of-using-sterilization-as-a-bargaining-chip-for-plea-deals.html">Tennessee</a>, prosecutors have offered plea deals to women who agreed to sterilization, until the practice was banned in 2015. Pregnant women have faced serious criminal charges for experiencing
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/20/us/chelsea-becker-stillbirth-murder-charges-california.html">stillbirth</a>, suffering a miscarriage that prosecutors attributed (with no evidence)
					<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/brittany-poolaw-manslaughter-miscarriage-pregnancy/">to drug use</a>, getting shot in the stomach during a
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/opinion/alabama-pregnant-woman-shot.html">physical altercation</a>, and
					<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/30/indiana-prosecuting-chinese-woman-suicide-foetus">attempting suicide</a>.</p>
				<p>In a post-<i>Roe</i>
					America, more punishments like this would not be surprising in conservative states. States that will criminalize abortion after the Supreme Court reverses Roe have
					<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/15/us/alabama-abortion-law-felony-trnd/index.html">vowed</a>
					not to punish
					<a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961">pregnant people</a>.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, the reasons for this pledge are clear: Most Americans oppose the idea of criminally punishing
					<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-call-to-punish-women-who-have-abortions-is-way-outside-the-mainstream/">pregnant people</a>, and the anti-abortion movement has treaded carefully so as not to lose support. But as the elimination of rape and incest exceptions suggests, the thought of offending popular majorities may not matter for long.</p>

				<p dir="ltr">Parents know that winter is the season of sickness. Your kid will have approximately infinite colds. You, too, will have approximately infinite colds. Last winter, COVID precautions kept sickness at bay. But this year, school is in
					session, day-care colds
					<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/06/16/increase-colds-rsv-kids/">are spreading fast</a>, and the only cohort of people in America not yet eligible for COVID vaccination is our youngest children.</p>
				<p>Aside from promises of clinical-trial data by the end of the year, the timeline on which children younger than 5 might be vaccinated is still unclear. The parents of these kids are staring down months more of carefully weighing the risks of COVID
					against the benefits of indoor cheer. My own child, now 20 months old, was born in March 2020, so my entire experience of parenting has been pandemic-inflected. As the cold creeps down the East Coast, where I live, and nudges the people around me
					inside, I have been thinking about how the responsibility and anxiety of navigating around this one infectious disease might linger longer for the parents of small children than for most other Americans.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Some days, the idea that my family will still have to be making these calculations far into 2022 feels impossible to grasp. How can it be that even after
					<em>two years</em>, I won’t be able to meet my friends and their kids at the aquarium, or a museum, or a pizza place without dedicating brain space to what we’re all risking? How are other parents handling this? As cases rise again and the season of sickness
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/flu-season-winter-america-choice/620373/?utm_source=feed">sets in</a>, I asked that question to a small group of my
					<em>Atlantic</em>
					colleagues:</p>
				<ul>
					<li aria-level="1" dir="ltr">
						<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Julie Bogen, a senior editor on the audience team, who has a 20-month-old</p>
					</li>

						<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Becca Rosen, a senior editor on the Ideas team, who has a 3-year-old and a 7-year-old.</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>All of us live in New York City or Washington, D.C.—places with high vaccination rates—and, as
					<em>Atlantic</em>
					employees, we’ve all been able to work from home throughout the pandemic. All of our kids are, for at least part of the week, going to school or day care (at least until an inevitable fever triggers pandemic-era policies that require kids to stay
					away and get tested for COVID). All of us understand that the risk of healthy kids getting severe COVID is relatively low, but we are still limiting our activities to some extent. As a rule, we avoid taking our kids to busy indoor places, and we’re
					generally still choosy about whom we invite over. We were joined by Natalie Dean, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at Emory University, who specializes in infectious-disease research and has, herself, a 4-year-old and an
					almost-2-year-old.</p>
				<p>What follows is a transcript, edited for length and clarity, of our conversation about the risks we’ve taken, the risks we might take, and the pressing questions we now have about America’s approach to childhood sickness.</p>
				<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
				<p dir="ltr">
					<strong>Sarah Laskow:
					</strong>I’m curious: What would change anyone’s COVID calculus at this point? For those of you with older kids, does having them vaccinated change anything at all?</p>
				<p dir="ltr">
					<strong>Daniel Engber:</strong>
					My daughter had her first dose of the vaccine and is going to get her second dose in a couple of weeks. I got really excited about the idea of
					<em>let’s set up new rules for the family</em>. And then we realized we didn’t even have clearly delineated
					<em>old</em>
					rules.</p>
				<p dir="ltr">I feel like some of our attitudes are shifting toward thinking about the state of community transmission—so if we come up with some new rules now, will they look different in a month if case rates are shooting up in New York City? That
					feels much harder to do. It’s a lot easier to think in terms of which or how many of us are vaccinated than to start thinking about these moving targets. Do we want to look by city, or county, or borough, or state? National rates? What should we be
					keeping track of? Or should we stop keeping track of anything and kind of abandon rules altogether?</p>
				<p dir="ltr">
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					It seems to me like a lot of parents are thinking that way.
					<em>Well, once my kid is vaccinated, then I can change my behavior.</em>
					Short of that, I don’t know what to do. Julie and I both had kids right at the beginning of the pandemic, and I wonder, for you, Julie, is there anything short of your child getting vaccinated that you think would change your behavior at this point?</p>
				<p dir="ltr">
					<strong>Julie Bogen:</strong>
					There was very briefly a period over the summer when people were getting vaccinated and mask mandates were still in place in Montgomery County when we were like,
					<em>Oh, maybe we’ll take her to the grocery store.</em>
					But right now, in part because of my husband’s job as a doctor who treats COVID patients, but also because of the notion of, like,
					<em>Okay, well, if we do take a risk, and she gets sick or her day care closes, that’s another 10 to 14 days I have to be out of work</em>, the disruption is so significant.</p>
				<p>Also I feel so paralyzed by judgment of other people and parents if we were to get sick. You know, like,
					<em>Oh, you guys got COVID? Do you know how you got it? Did you do something irresponsible to get it?</em>
					I really can’t think of anything short of my daughter getting vaccinated that would change our behavior right now. I feel like I don’t know how to not blame myself if something went wrong.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					Natalie, does the availability of vaccines for older kids matter in any of these calculations?</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Natalie Dean:</strong>
					Having the older kids vaccinated does matter in the sense that kids have a certain set of people they interact with, and that includes older siblings. Just having fewer opportunities for the family to be impacted by needing to isolate or quarantine,
					that will certainly help. Older kids are also just a big chunk of the population that will be less likely to get infected and less likely to transmit once they’re fully vaccinated. But it’s going to be a long time, maybe never, that we’re going to
					see case rates really go to zero. I think we just need to be realistic about that—this virus is going to continue to circulate for a while.</p>
				<p>I also wanted to make a comment about this stigma. Because of the nature of the pandemic, there’s a lot of stigma about transmission, and I think we’re going to need to move past some of that as well. There’s not the same stigma about RSV or flu
					or these other respiratory pathogens, and they cause a pretty similar risk to kids. That would be another thing that, as we move forward, we need to grapple with.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Becca Rosen:</strong>
					I’ve been trying to make the case among my friends and to colleagues that getting COVID is not a sign of personal failure. We live in a society with illness, and we don’t blame people when they get flu. We have to learn to not see getting COVID as a
					<em>moral</em>
					failure. Because this is something we have to live with, and the truth is that we will all be exposed.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/what-americas-covid-goal-now/620572/?utm_source=feed">Read: America has lost the plot on COVID</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>To go back to what Julie was saying, the practical disruption of a COVID infection to people’s lives is so much worse than with RSV or with flu because of the policies we have in place. So it seems like we’re in a spot where we really, really do
					need to update our policies for a COVID-endemic world. Especially with our testing infrastructure still really dysfunctional, even testing negative to return to school after a COVID exposure can mean days out of work for a parent. For a lot of
					parents, that’s just not tenable.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dean:</strong>
					Part of living with the disease, too, is improving testing infrastructure in the way that we really need to get it to work. It doesn’t mean that testing needs to go away, but that it needs to be strengthened.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Engber:</strong>
					I feel like when my older daughter is fully vaccinated, it increases my urge to ignore or subvert some of the policies. I just wonder if other parents have had that thought too. Like, if she’s fully vaccinated and has a stuffy nose and it might be
					allergies, am I going to really adhere to the rules of her school’s screening process? I feel my attitude toward the policies and their legitimacy is changing in real time.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Rosen:</strong>
					I think the policy sometimes discourages people from testing. Because they don’t want to wait on a result or risk getting a false positive, which is just totally a perverse outcome.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Bogen:
					</strong>Especially because the tests take so long. And my daughter’s day care doesn’t want her to come in if she has a
					<em>pending</em>
					COVID test. We test every time we go to our parents’ houses in Connecticut, for example, and because she has a pending test, we’re not supposed to send her. And it’s like, now we just don’t want to tell you.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					How is everyone thinking about your responsibility to the other kids and parents in collective situations? If your kid is going to day care or school, do you think about what you could be bringing to that space? Or is it more about keeping your own
					family protected?</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Nick Catucci:</strong>
					I am on the knife edge, sending my daughter to day care five days a week, between being incredibly resentful every time she catches a cold from some other kid and then being like,
					<em>How in the world am I not going to send her to day care today, even though she has the sniffles?</em>
					And so I just rely on the school to tell me. We would never send her to school with a fever, because that’s one of the rules—a fever is really the only thing that excludes you. But she has had a runny nose and a cough for months, basically, and we
					just live with that.</p>
				<p>In my building, you have to put on a mask coming in and out of the building. And for my daughter … I just don’t. I flout it for my daughter. I don’t make her put a mask on for the two minutes that we’re walking to the elevator and taking the
					elevator up and going into our apartment.
					<em>I</em>
					put it on. And I am very pro-mask, but part of me is like,
					<em>Why are we still doing this?</em>
					I know a lot of people in this building are vaccinated. This seems silly.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					I think part of what we’re circling around is this dynamic—Sarah Zhang wrote about this in an
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/what-americas-covid-goal-now/620572/?utm_source=feed">
						<em>Atlantic</em>
						article</a>
					recently—that because we don’t have an agreement anymore about what the overall goal for COVID management is, we don’t have a shared set of rules that we’re moving toward. What I hear in this conversation is the frustration among people who have been
					taking COVID precautions and getting vaccinated and who are now running up against the limits of what’s possible with that.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Rosen:</strong>
					My memory of being a new parent, for both kids, who were pre-pandemic babies, is that we were just sick all the time. There wasn’t the level of disruption to our lives now required by the policies of day cares and schools for testing and quarantining
					and everything—but it was still hugely disruptive. So I’ve just been thinking about the question of work and how, across society, we need to have better sick-leave policies to deal with not just COVID, but the childhood viruses that kids get all the
					time. How can we update our thinking about parenthood beyond the first couple of months of life to be more aware of the illnesses that kids and parents deal with? And how can work and school and all these other institutions that we interact with
					build illness into our real understanding of what people’s lived experiences are?</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Engber:</strong>
					Before the pandemic, there was the same kind of stigma and anger. I would feel like,
					<em>So-and-so went to a birthday party with coxsackievirus, what a jerk.</em>
					This heightened care that we’re taking with children—are there good parts of that, that should persist when the kind of acute phase of the pandemic is over? And what should that new normal look like for how cautious we are with our kids and
					infectious diseases?</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					I think my biggest question is: How much should I worry about my kid being an agent of spread as an unvaccinated person, given how many people around her are vaccinated? What is our responsibility as parents to other people, to keep our kid from
					infecting them? And then, what’s society’s responsibility toward us, as parents?</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Bogen:</strong>
					Right—what do we owe other people, given that they’re the ones who are vaccinated while our children are not? I still don’t know what I owe my own child, given that her risk is so low. I’m doing everything I can to protect her. My husband and I are
					doing everything we can to protect the people around us. But, you know, we’re both vaccinated, and we’re still avoiding going to the grocery store with her. We still don’t eat indoors. We still see so few people. Are we missing out on huge areas of
					life and sanity restoration for nothing? I just don’t know.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					Natalie, given that we’re moving toward endemic COVID, is there a certain point when parents should shift their thinking about any of this? Or what’s the point at which we can stop thinking about this at all?</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Dean:</strong>
					When will we stop being able to think about it at all? That might be a ways off. I think that there is going to be this new normal that will involve some level of different procedures for day cares and kids around all illnesses.</p>
				<p>I really do weigh, if the situation is not going to change that quickly, what am I willing to add back to my life that I think is valuable? Of course, we should acknowledge people who have children who are immunocompromised—that requires really
					working out a plan with their specialists and requires a different set of considerations. But for otherwise healthy children, because the risks remain low, I want them to be able to have some fun. And so I’m letting them have playdates, for the most
					part still outdoors. But when the weather is yucky, it can be indoors—we have been doing maskless play dates with one other family. My thinking has shifted to a longer time horizon, because this is going to stick with us for a while. I don’t want to
					wait forever to resume some of those things.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Laskow:</strong>
					I think that ultimately that is the challenge of being a parent in the pandemic. It’s been a long, long time now, and we want our kids to have lives. And if they don’t experience things now, then they won’t experience them at that time in their life,
					which is a pretty intense calculation in the end.</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Rosen:</strong>
					Yeah, I mean, it really gets me, what my daughter went through when she was 5. We basically cut off all her closest friendships for months on end. And I think friendships at that age are so formative and so foundational to who you become. I think
					kids deserve a lot at this point. They’ve been through a lot. My daughter will say to me, “Your childhood was so special because you don’t have to deal with a pandemic.” My 7-year-old articulates that. She gets what she’s been through and how
					abnormal and hard it was.</p>

			<content type="html">
				<p>Conservatives in America have, in recent months, used the idea of freedom to argue against
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/freedom-is-the-only-argument-that-might-work-with-vaccine-holdouts/619609/?utm_source=feed">wearing masks</a>, oppose
					<a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/17/1046598351/the-political-fight-over-vaccine-mandates-deepens-despite-their-effectiveness">vaccine mandates</a>, and justify
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/09/us/capitol-rioters.html">storming the Capitol</a>. They routinely refer to themselves as “<a href="https://wjno.iheart.com/featured/glenn-beck/content/2021-02-28-glenn-beck-blog-here-are-the-six-principles-of-freedom-loving-americans/">freedom-loving Americans</a>.” Freedom, as a cause, today
					<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/opinion/covid-masks-freedom-democrats.html">belongs almost entirely to the right</a>.</p>
				<p>This was not always the case. In the early 1960s, civil-rights activists invoked freedom as the purpose of their struggle. Martin Luther King Jr. used the word
					<em>equality</em>
					once at the March on Washington, but he used the word
					<em>freedom</em>
					20 times.</p>
				<p>The conservative use of the idea of absolute freedom, of freedom as your personal property, to shift American politics to the right came shortly after King’s speech, and indeed was a direct reaction to his argument that one’s own freedom depended
					on everyone else’s. This wasn’t an organic response. Rather, conservative activists and business leaders designed an opposite idea of American freedom to protect their own interests. That effort can be seen in the role played by one of the most
					overlooked yet powerful forces in 20th-century America: the nation’s Realtors.</p>
				<p>In 1963, California, with half of the country’s Realtors, passed a fair-housing law to limit housing discrimination. Realtors decided to fight back. They asked voters to approve a state constitutional amendment, Proposition 14, prohibiting the
					state and any municipality from ever limiting residential discrimination in any way.</p>
				<p>Realtors had big incentives for maintaining segregation. Having invented it in the early 1900s as a marketing tool for selling homes, they had made segregation central to their business practices. They created racial covenants to exclude members
					of minority groups from new developments, existing neighborhoods, and entire cities and shaped federal redlining maps, all premised on the idea that anyone selling to minority families was destroying the future of all the neighbors. Any broker who
					did so was therefore destroying his future business. Despite the Supreme Court outlawing court enforcement of racial covenants in 1948, Realtors used racial steering—such as lying to minority prospective buyers that a home had just been sold and
					controlling newspaper real-estate listings—so effectively that by the early ’60s, Black Americans were excluded from 98 percent of new homes and 95 percent of neighborhoods.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/03/the-unfulfilled-promise-of-fair-housing/557009/?utm_source=feed">Read: The unfulfilled promise of fair housing</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>But in asking voters to constitutionally authorize residential discrimination in Proposition 14, Realtors had a fundamental problem. How, at the height of the civil-rights movement, could they publicly campaign for sanctioning discrimination in
					California? No state’s constitution, even in the Deep South, had such a provision. No prominent politician—not Barry Goldwater, not Ronald Reagan—would support the Realtors for fear of seeming racist.</p>
				<p>Victory would depend, realized Spike Wilson, the president of the California Real Estate Association, on convincing the large majority of white voters—who did not want to see themselves as racially prejudiced in any way—that the Realtors were
					campaigning not for discrimination but for American freedom. Realtors would need to secretly and systematically redefine American freedom as the freedom to discriminate—to challenge the idea at the heart of the civil-rights movement itself.</p>
				<p>The first step was inventing what became known as “color-blind freedom” to justify discrimination. Per Wilson’s request, the national Realtors’ organization created a secret action kit to oppose fair housing everywhere. The kit’s detailed scripts
					instructed Realtors to “focus on freedom” and avoid “discussion of emotionally charged subjects,” such as “inferiority of races.” This kit, weighing a pound and a half and distributed to the local real-estate board in every American city, provided
					form speeches, Q&amp;amp;As, and press releases for their cause. Freedom, the kit explained, meant each owner’s right to discriminate, and Realtors were in favor of “freedom for all”: the equal rights of all owners to choose whom to sell to. Realtors
					claimed that they, unlike civil-rights advocates, were color-blind.</p>
				<p>The key to color-blind freedom was what was left out. Wilson drafted a Property Owners’ Bill of Rights that Realtors advertised in newspapers nationwide, emphasizing owners’ absolute right to dispose of their property—never mentioning anyone’s
					right to buy or rent a home in the first place. The right to be treated equally, to not be discriminated against, to choose where to live, was not part of American freedom but
					<em>a special privilege</em>. Wilson therefore claimed that “<a
						href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Far_from_Utopia/w5BOAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=1&amp;amp;bsq=%22militant+minorities+have+organized+and+vocalized%22&amp;amp;dq=%22militant+minorities+have+organized+and+vocalized%22&amp;amp;printsec=frontcover">militant minorities have organized and vocalized for equal rights until equal rights have become special privileges</a>.” Color-blind freedom meant that government must be oblivious to, must forever allow, organized private discrimination.</p>
				<p>Realtors thus made government the enemy, not minority groups. “Am I anti-Negro? By God, I am not. I am their champion,” Wilson insisted at a meeting of apartment owners, the<em>
						Los Angeles Times</em>
					reported. By making state bureaucrats the enemy, Realtors could be on the side of the underdog, the individual owner. Proposition 14, Realtors claimed, was not about race but about “the rights of the individual.”</p>
				<p>This idea of absolute individual rights was at the heart of how Realtors redefined American freedom.
					<span class="smallcaps">Freedom of choice</span>
					was blazoned on L.A. freeway billboards. To discriminate simply means to choose, Realtors insisted. Freedom of choice
					<em>required</em>
					the right to discriminate.</p>
				<p>This became Wilson’s most important argument to millions of Californians who did not want to see themselves as racially biased. To be in favor of Proposition 14, to limit where millions of fellow Americans could live, did not mean that you were
					prejudiced but that you believed in individual freedom.</p>
				<p>Calling the Realtors’ campaign “<a
					href="https://books.google.com/books?id=YEUpEAAAQBAJ&amp;amp;pg=PA168&amp;amp;lpg=PA168&amp;amp;dq=%E2%80%9CGettysburg,%E2%80%9D+%22California+Real+Estate+Magazine%22,+July+1964&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=uVgEFKseRn&amp;amp;sig=ACfU3U1SeLxh047ZCZ03kzJTi_jMc9YHIg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiZyd_yl_DzAhWwTN8KHcG8AwoQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=%E2%80%9CGettysburg%2C%E2%80%9D%20%22California%20Real%20Estate%20Magazine%22%2C%20July%201964&amp;amp;f=false">Gettysburg—1964!</a>” in the monthly magazine
					<em>California Real Estate</em>, Wilson cited Abraham Lincoln: “We are involved in a great battle for liberty and freedom. We have prepared a final resting place for the drive to destroy individual freedom.”</p>
				<p>King recognized the danger of the Realtors’ ideology. Rushing from ongoing civil-rights conflicts in the South, he warned at a freedom rally in Fresno, a few miles from Wilson’s office, “If this initiative passes, it will defeat all we have been
					struggling to win.” King’s terms evoked his speech at the March on Washington, but he was now defending shared freedom not against southern diehards but against northern salesmen promoting color-blind “freedom of choice.”</p>
				<p>Proposition 14’s sweeping passage stunned politicians in both parties. The Realtors’ victory was overwhelming, with 65 percent of the total votes in favor, including 75 percent of the white vote and 80 percent of the white union vote. Two years
					later, in 1966, when the California Supreme Court ruled Proposition 14 unconstitutional, Reagan, running for governor, adopted the Realtors’ cause and their message as his own: “<a href="https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&amp;amp;d=MT19661121.2.56&amp;amp;srpos=1&amp;amp;e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22if+an+individual+wants+to+discriminate+against+Negroes+or+others+in+selling+or+renting+his+house%22-------1">If an individual wants to discriminate against Negroes or others in selling or renting his house, he has a right to do so</a>.”</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/the-racist-housing-policy-that-made-your-neighborhood/371439/?utm_source=feed">Read: The racist housing policy that made your neighborhood</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>Reagan and other conservatives saw that the Realtors had zeroed in on something extremely powerful—something whose full force would not be limited to housing segregation but could be used on virtually any issue.</p>
				<p>The timing was crucial. At the very moment when liberalism seemed most dominant—on the same 1964 ballot where Lyndon B. Johnson had crushed Goldwater by the largest landslide in history—Realtors had shown how conservatives could succeed. If this
					idea of freedom could triumph in California, it could work anywhere.</p>
				<p>The Realtors themselves ultimately lost their war against fair housing when Congress passed a fair-housing bill, weakened by the shadow of Proposition 14, days after King’s assassination in 1968. Realtor organizations today distance themselves
					from their past role in segregation. Dave Walsh, the president of the California Association of Realtors (the modern-day incarnation of the California Real Estate Association) acknowledged by email the “sad truth that real estate agents, REALTOR®
					associations, real estate developers, government officials, and others developed and supported systems and policies designed to exclude people of color, especially Blacks, from many neighborhoods and homeownership opportunities.” He added that
					Realtors today “must own the fact that in the past, we advocated for” rights that supported discrimination. But though Realtors have disavowed their past arguments, the vision of freedom they created has had lasting effects on American politics as a
					whole.</p>
				<p>This vision of freedom proved so enduring because it solved three structural problems for American conservatism.</p>
				<p>First, Realtors used the language of individual freedom, of libertarianism, to justify its seeming opposite, community conformity. Here was a way to unite the two separate and competing strands of conservatism, to link libertarians and social
					conservatives in defense of American freedom—and create the way many, if not most, Americans understand freedom today.</p>
				<p>Thus, the more disparate the issues on which this idea of freedom was invoked—abortion, guns, public schools, gender rights, campaign finance, climate change—the more powerful the message became. The conservative movement’s ability to grow and
					thrive depended not on an adventitious alliance but on a unifying idea: freedom of choice.</p>
				<p>Second, by defining as
					<em>freedom</em>
					what government seemed to be taking away from “ordinary Americans,” Realtors helped create a polarizing, transcendent view of what was at stake in our politics. As one homeowner described Proposition 14 in a<em>
						Sacramento Bee</em>
					letter to the editor, “We are fighting for our rights, and this, voters, is the only way we can do it. It appears to be our last chance.” This picture of government taking away your rights would provide a compelling reason, far beyond economics, for
					millions of union members, Catholics, and white Americans who had long been part of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s coalition to see, in issue after issue, why they should define themselves as conservatives.</p>
				<p>Timeliest of all, the Realtors’ redefinition of freedom offered a common ideology for something new in modern America: a national conservative political party. First proposed by southern racists in 1948 to protect Jim Crow, it would have

This proposed party, devoted to limiting federal regulation of business and civil rights, could dominate American politics and push it to the right for generations to come.</p>
				<p>Such party, when it finally emerged after Goldwater’s defeat, needed a publicly acceptable ideology that could work in both the North and the South. The Realtors’ color-blind freedom, which had proved so successful in California, could unite
					southerners, working-class northern Democrats, and conservative and moderate Republicans in a new national majority party—one very different from the Republican Party whose congressmen had voted 80 percent in favor of the Civil Rights and Voting
					Rights Acts.</p>

				</p>
				<p>Over time, the internal dynamics of a national conservative party would only push it further and further toward those who most ardently embraced the Realtors’ vision of freedom as the only meaning of American freedom. This dynamic has produced
					today’s Republican Party.</p>
				<p>Republican politicians now view every issue through this single lens: that American freedom means placing one’s own absolute rights over those of others. To go against that credo, to view freedom as belonging to the country itself and, as such, to
					everyone equally, threatens the party’s most basic tenet.</p>
				<p>This idea of freedom is based on a technique that the Realtors perfected. They identified a single, narrow, obscure right, an owner’s right to choose a buyer—which Realtors themselves had restricted for decades with racial covenants—as American
					freedom itself. Elevating as absolute a right rarely mentioned before, so government cannot limit it or protect the rights of others, became the model for the conservative movement. The concept can be and has been used regarding virtually any issue.</p>
				<p>Everything that is not one of these carefully selected rights becomes, by definition, a privilege that government cannot protect, no matter how fundamental. Since January 6, two-thirds of Republicans—more than 40 percent of all Americans—now
					<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/07/22/wide-partisan-divide-on-whether-voting-is-a-fundamental-right-or-a-privilege-with-responsibilities/">see voting not as a basic right, an essential part of our freedom, but as a privilege for those who deserve it</a>.</p>
				<p>This picture of freedom has a purpose: to effectively prioritize the freedoms of certain Americans over the freedoms of others—without directly saying so. By defining freedom as they did, Realtors did not have to say that it belonged more to some
					Americans than others. But it did—and it has ever since.</p>

				<p>Although masks, distancing, ventilation, testing, and contact tracing have all helped forestall a collapse of the American health-care system under the weight of COVID-19, the pandemic will come under control in only two ways:
					Preventives—specifically vaccines—will harness people’s immune system to keep them from becoming infected, getting sick, and spreading the coronavirus, while targeted therapeutics will offer hope to those who have already developed symptoms. The
					emergence of Omicron, a worrisome new variant of the coronavirus, underscores the need to use multiple tools to fight the disease. In infectious diseases, control of a pathogen means reducing its impact
					<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/09/21/covid-pandemic-end/__;!!LQC6Cpwp!9h_9mX2l4yuFzBPvha4ZcBDOPu3eUDxzac1dO9H6S8rhVEe3N6I3DcyQU-pUmu2O-kzy%24">even if it remains endemic</a>
					in the world. Fortunately, the United States is poised to authorize two oral antivirals: molnupiravir and Paxlovid. The former is the generic name of a drug made by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics; the latter is the trade name of a drug
					combination made by Pfizer. Both come in pill form, and a five-day treatment course of each will provide certain patients with significant benefits.</p>
				<p>These miraculous drugs arrived with minimal fanfare but represent the biggest advance yet in treating patients already infected with COVID-19. The supply of vaccines in the U.S. has exceeded demand for some time, and authorities recently widened

					for influenza hints at the value of COVID drugs that can be provided in an outpatient setting and reduce the severity of symptoms for unvaccinated and vaccinated patients alike.</p>

				</p>
				<p>Molnupiravir and Paxlovid are particularly exciting because antivirals that effectively target viruses at specific points in their life cycle are the “holy grail” of viral therapeutics—as past experience with other viruses has shown. Infection
					with HIV was fatal for nearly all patients until antivirals were developed against enzymes crucial to viral replication and researchers figured out how to combine those drugs to maximize their effectiveness and limit the emergence of resistant viral
					strains. These changes revolutionized HIV treatment, massively improving the prognosis for people who had access to antivirals. Instead of developing severe illness, treated patients could live healthily and expect
					<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.aidsmap.com/about-hiv/life-expectancy-people-living-hiv__;!!LQC6Cpwp!9h_9mX2l4yuFzBPvha4ZcBDOPu3eUDxzac1dO9H6S8rhVEe3N6I3DcyQU-pUmpWEy6B-%24">normal life spans</a>.</p>
				<p>The development of these highly active oral antivirals for HIV infection took a decade and a half after the disease first came to light; the incredible progress in COVID-19 therapeutics took 18 months. Intriguingly, the COVID-19-treatment research
					borrowed many ideas from the HIV field; the two new COVID-19 drugs focus on similar pathways in the viral life cycle that HIV drugs target. In essence, these drugs prevent the target virus from reproducing itself. Because they work differently from
					the majority of COVID-19 vaccines, which teach the immune system to identify and attack the coronavirus’s characteristic spike protein, the antivirals remain effective against mutant variants whose spike proteins are harder for immune cells to
					recognize. Designing, manufacturing, and distributing vaccines updated for new variants will take time, so the availability of antivirals will be all the more essential.</p>
				<p>The rapid development of vaccines against COVID-19—something that doesn’t yet exist for HIV—has overshadowed the progress on treatments. And yet, the need and public demand for effective medications are evident. Doctors and patients have sought
					out potential oral COVID-19 treatments, including drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, that did not prove effective in clinical trials. But researchers needed to keep working on the question, because COVID-19 will be with us for the long
					haul. Although health experts agree that preventing a disease is better than treating its symptoms, not everyone will get vaccinated. People who become infected are worthy of compassion and care, regardless of the circumstances of their infection,
					and medical treatments that shorten the period of viral transmission and keep unvaccinated COVID-19 patients out of hospital beds will protect everyone.</p>
				<p>The COVID-19 treatments that have shown some effectiveness up to this point have significant drawbacks. Remdesivir is an intravenous antiviral used for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. But by the time a patient is admitted, the virus may
					already have caused considerable damage, and viral replication may have stopped. An intravenous drug has far less power to affect the trajectory of the pandemic than affordable, effective, and short courses of oral pills do. Until now, the only
					outpatient therapeutic for COVID-19 has been
					<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/combatcovid.hhs.gov/i-have-covid-19-now/monoclonal-antibodies-high-risk-covid-19-positive-patients__;!!LQC6Cpwp!9h_9mX2l4yuFzBPvha4ZcBDOPu3eUDxzac1dO9H6S8rhVEe3N6I3DcyQU-pUmvpAzW6t%24">monoclonal antibody treatments</a>, which are effective in preventing severe disease in high-risk patients. But they are expensive and require intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection, and health-care providers must monitor their administration closely.</p>
				<p>Although molnupiravir—which is named after the Norse god Thor’s hammer, Mjölnir—was being tested for the treatment of the Ebola virus, researchers had not settled upon a purpose for the drug before SARS-CoV-2 arrived on the scene. Early studies of
					molnupiravir showed that its recipients
					<a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.17.21258639v1__;!!LQC6Cpwp!9h_9mX2l4yuFzBPvha4ZcBDOPu3eUDxzac1dO9H6S8rhVEe3N6I3DcyQU-pUmkhDlF5z%24">cleared the coronavirus more rapidly</a>

					but in outpatients with mild to moderate disease who had a high vulnerability to severe disease, it reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 30 percent if given within five days of developing symptoms. The drug proved so beneficial that the

				</p>
				<p>The importance of these two highly anticipated outpatient antivirals for COVID-19 cannot be overstated. Both medications were studied in unvaccinated individuals, of which the U.S. and other countries around the world have many. For the
					vaccinated, “breakthrough” infections are generally mild, but they can lead to time out of work and require cutting back contact with others. Not only should rapid treatment with one of these two antivirals shorten symptoms in breakthrough infections
					(as is the case with influenza), but bringing down the viral load quickly by inhibiting viral replication should limit transmission.</p>
				<p>Further study of the new COVID-19 drugs is under way for potential use in lower-risk individuals and as preventive medications. The development of HIV antivirals also led to the development of “post-exposure prophylaxis,” a strategy in which
					people who have come in contact with that virus take antivirals to avoid becoming HIV-positive. The new COVID drugs have at least the potential to provide a similar benefit. Moreover, the development of these two antivirals is spurring research on
					other COVID-19-specific antivirals. So despite the arrival of Omicron, we still have grounds for optimism. Last year ended with the authorization of highly effective COVID-19 vaccines, and 2021 should end with the availability of highly effective,
					targeted COVID-19 treatments that will help the world live with COVID-19.</p>

				<p class="dropcap">A<span class="smallcaps">lex Masmej revered</span>
					Steve Jobs—his favorite shirt was emblazoned with
					<span class="smallcaps">Apples that changed the world</span>:
					<span class="smallcaps">Adam’s, Isaac’s, Steve’s</span>. Masmej dreamed of moving to Silicon Valley to start his own company, but he just didn’t have the money. In April 2020, as the world reeled from the coronavirus pandemic, Masmej found himself stuck in his home city of Paris.</p>
				<p>So Masmej did something few 23-year-olds would think to do: He tokenized himself. That is, he created a financial instrument known as a social token, a form of cryptocurrency whose value revolves around a person, to sell shares in himself. Holders
					of $ALEX would receive 15 percent of Masmej’s income for the next three years, capped at $100,000 overall, and would be able to exchange tokens for special privileges: 10,000 $ALEX bought a retweet from Masmej on Twitter; 20,000 $ALEX, a one-on-one
					conversation with him; 30,000 $ALEX, an introduction to someone in his network. In five days, Masmej raised $20,092, enough to send him across the Atlantic to San Francisco to launch his start-up.</p>
				<p>I work as a venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, and I met Masmej in San Francisco. When he shared his story with me, I was struck by what Masmej’s path to California signaled. Rather than borrow money from investors, friends, or family, Masmej made
					<em>himself
					</em>the investment.</p>
				<p>This may sound dystopian to some, the plotline of a
					<em>Black Mirror</em>
					episode. But social tokens are part of a broader and fundamentally positive phenomenon: everyone is becoming an investor. Over time, wealth has accumulated with a select few—the investing class—while the rest of America rents time as salaried and
					hourly workers. Only one in two Americans has any exposure to the stock market, and that exposure is stratified by income: Just
					<a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/what-percentage-of-americans-own-stock/">15
					</a>
					<a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/what-percentage-of-americans-own-stock/">percent</a>
					of families in the bottom 20 percent of income earners hold stock, compared with 92 percent of families in the top 10 percent.</p>
				<p>But moves by Masmej and others like him point to a shift. More and more of the world is becoming financialized, allowing people to invest not just in companies or government bonds but also in art, collectibles, and celebrities. Parallel shifts in
					culture and technology are forging a new paradigm. The rules around how we create and capture economic value are being rewritten, opening up new roads to the kind of wealth creation previously limited to a select few.</p>
				<p class="dropcap">T<span class="smallcaps">oday’s youth are</span>
					leading this transformation by rejecting long-held beliefs: that you should stay with a corporation until you’re ready to collect your pension; that you should spend the hours of 9 to 5 chained to your desk; that you should work for anyone at all.
					<a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/150077/Students-Entrepreneurial-Energy-Waiting-Tapped.aspx">Nearly 80 percent</a>
					of teenagers say they want to be their own boss; 40 percent aspire to start their own business. Young people watched their parents and grandparents get burned during the Great Recession and again during the pandemic. They harbor a certain cynicism:
					One 16-year-old mocked me recently for denoting laughter with 😂, rather than with 💀 or ⚰️. Gen Z humor is gallows humor. But this pragmatism breeds first-principles thinking. Why work within the “system” with a capped upside when you can use your
					hustle and savvy to dictate your own fortune?</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/10/millennials-gen-z-boomers-generations-are-fake/620390/?utm_source=feed">Read: ‘Gen Z’ only exists in your head</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>We see this cultural shift in the 23 million people buying stocks on Robinhood and in the 46 million Americans who own cryptocurrency. We see it in NFT mania, in the deification of Elon Musk, in the GameStop phenomenon of last winter. If we expand
					“everyone is an investor” to “everyone is an owner,” we see ripple effects in the record-breaking
					<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/400ae372-0cb2-48bb-8767-7986848ed9a6">4.4 million businesses</a>
					started in 2020, or in the
					<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/921593/gig-economy-number-of-freelancers-us/">68 million</a>
					Americans who freelance.</p>
				<p>Even this generation’s superstars rethink old norms. The 19-year-old TikTok star Josh Richards had flirted with being a brand ambassador for Red Bull. When I asked him why he passed, he looked at me quizzically—why, he wondered, should he be the
					vessel for someone else’s wealth creation? That’s the playbook for celebrities of yesteryear. Instead, Richards launched his
					<em>own</em>
					energy-drink brand, Ani Energy, off the back of his 25 million TikTok followers. A year later, Ani is in over 400 Walmart stores.</p>
				<p>A new cultural mindset around ownership is colliding with new technology. We’re on the precipice of the third era of the web. The web’s first era was about information flowing freely—think Google giving you access to the world’s knowledge. Most of
					us were passive consumers in this era. The second era was the social web—Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. People began to create their own content, and that content became the lifeblood of the big platforms. We became active participants, but the
					platforms devoured all the profits.</p>
				<p>The promise of the internet was to erase the gatekeepers. Instead of waiting for a record label to sign you, you could share your music on Spotify. Instead of asking a publication to share your words, you could tweet. Instead of being tapped by a
					studio exec, you could become a YouTuber. But what happened is that these platforms became the
					<em>new</em>
					gatekeepers.</p>
				<p>The third era of the web is about righting the ship. Social capital becomes economic capital. Value no longer accumulates to brokers and intermediaries.</p>
				<p class="dropcap">W<span class="smallcaps">hat does this</span>
					mean in practice? Consider the music industry. Today, record labels capture the lion’s share of the money in music. Artists walk away with a little, and fans certainly don’t get any. But in this new era of the web, everyone can profit from culture.</p>
				<p>We all have the (slightly annoying) friend who insists that she knew about so-and-so before they were even famous. When it comes to Taylor Swift, I’m that friend—and I’m more than slightly annoying about it. I was a Taylor fan in her pre-<em>Fearless</em>, full-on country days, years before Kanye interrupted her onstage at the VMAs. But in our current construct of fandom, I’m treated no differently than the fan who discovered Swift on
					<em>SNL
					</em>a few weeks back.</p>
				<p>This would all be different, though, if Taylor had done what Masmej did and turned herself into an investment. She could have issued a social token. Whereas
					<em>non-fungible</em>
					tokens, or NFTs, are so called because of the uniqueness of a digital asset, social tokens are
					<em>fungible</em>. In other words, each $ALEX token is interchangeable with every other $ALEX token, just like a dollar bill can be traded for any other dollar bill. (If the dollar bill were signed by Barack Obama, though, it would become non-fungible.)</p>
				<p>Say Taylor had issued her own token—let’s call it $SWIFT—and say she had sold $SWIFT to her biggest fans. Say I was one such fan. Over time, as Taylor’s popularity grew, the value of $SWIFT would have appreciated. As an early believer, I would
					have shared in the financial upside of her growing fame. The $SWIFT I’d bought for $100 in 2007 might be worth $100,000 today.</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">

				</p>
				<p>The Taylor Swift mini-economy would serve both the singer and early fans like me. As an artist, Taylor could have funded her work by selling $SWIFT. She might not have needed to sell ownership of her masters, and she might not have been forced to
					<a href="https://time.com/5949979/why-taylor-swift-is-rerecording-old-albums/">rerecord her albums</a>
					to take back control over her art. Taylor’s fans, for their part, would have been rewarded for a decade of patronage: We’re all evangelists for our favorite artists, and yet we capture little of the value we help create. Social tokens uniquely
					combine elements of patronage (support for the artist), fandom (closer connection to the artist), and investment (financial upside from the appreciation of the digital asset).</p>
				<p>We can extend this example to any artist: What if you had discovered Billie Eilish on SoundCloud in 2016, or Lil Nas X before “Old Town Road” went viral? What if you’d loved the Beatles before they performed on
					<em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>?</p>
				<p>This isn’t some far-off vision; enterprising artists are already taking steps to build their own digital economies. The Grammy-winning artist RAC
					<a href="https://blog.ourzora.com/home/introducing-rac">launched $RAC
					</a>last fall with the caveat that fans can’t buy $RAC—they can only
					<em>earn</em>
					it through their fandom. RAC distributed $RAC retroactively to fans based on their support: whether they’d been a Patreon subscriber, whether they’d bought merchandise in the past, and so on. Fans could then cash in the $RAC they’d earned for
					exclusive access to the artist. You can envision this concept becoming more mainstream over time: What if the best seats at a Taylor Swift concert went not to the fan who has the most money but to the fan who has earned the most $SWIFT by racking up
					Spotify streams?</p>
				<p class="dropcap">T<span class="smallcaps">o be clear,</span>
					the financialization of everything isn’t an unalloyed benefit. The phenomenon has a dark side. If everyone becomes an investor, the inverse is also true: Everything—and
					<em>everyone</em>—becomes a potential investment. As part of $ALEX, Alex Masmej designed a “<a href="https://medium.com/@AlexMasmej/introducing-control-my-life-use-my-cryptocurrency-alex-to-vote-on-my-life-choices-8d62471963cd">Control My Life</a>”component.Token-holderscouldvoteon his life decisions—whether he should run three miles every day, stop eating red meat, wake up at 6 a.m. Token-holders had a financial stake in his success, so Masmej followed through on their commands. (To befair, Masmejadmits this wasjust “afunexperiment.”)</p>
				<p>We’ll have to answer two key questions. First, at what point does human agency give way to financial obligation? And second, at what point does a relationship become a transaction? There’s a fine line between investment and speculation, and
					between speculation and gambling. What happens when someone loses money on $ALEX or $SWIFT? Financializing life and culture could distribute economic value more evenly and equitably, but the system must be designed with guardrails to ensure that we
					don’t sacrifice our humanity.</p>
				<p>These are challenges, but all innovation brings challenges; these challenges shouldn’t prevent opportunity. Investing used to be limited to the stock market, something arcane and inaccessible to many Americans. Now nearly everything is investable.
					<a href="https://www.masterworks.io/">Masterworks</a>
					lets you invest in fine art, owning a share of a Banksy.
					<a href="https://royal.io/">Royal</a>
					lets you buy a share of a song and earn royalties—you could own a piece of the next “Bohemian Rhapsody” or “Hey Jude.”
					<a href="https://www.withotis.com/">Otis</a>
					calls itself “the stock market for culture,” letting you invest in LeBron James basketball cards and Air Jordan sneakers.</p>
				<p>This new era of cultural liquidity reorients access to capital. The past decade was about transferring social capital: likes and shares and retweets. Our social capital powered the profit engines of Facebook, Google, and Twitter. We’re now
					shifting to an economic era of the web, one in which everyone is an investor. This doesn’t mean that there shouldn’t be regulation, that companies and institutions shouldn’t think carefully about what safeguards to put in place. It doesn’t mean that
					there will be a human stock market where we buy and sell our friends. But this economic era does mean that everyone can invest—in fine art, in iconic songs, in public figures they believe in. This era means that it won’t be the few who are dictating
					culture, but the many. Popular culture will finally live up to its name.</p>

			<content type="html">
				<p>Congress has never been a place known for cutting-edge fashion. Instead, a stuffy formality has long been its trademark. As Allbirds and preppy quarter-zips swept into boardrooms and C-suites across the rest of the country, Capitol Hill remained
					one of the last bastions of traditional American business attire—the global headquarters of wing tips and ill-fitting suits, Tory Burch flats and bland Banana Republic pencil skirts. During sweltering D.C. summers, you could find communications
					directors and legislative aides wearing jackets and ties to work, wiping their sweaty brows on their uncuffed sleeves as the dew point climbed. The Hill is perhaps the last workplace in the country whose young employees still use the word
					<em>slacks</em>.</p>
				<p>But just like so many other great American traditions, Capitol Hill’s staid dress code has been disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic. Since most of the Hill has returned to working in person, a casualness has spread among some staffers. The trend
					is slight enough to be imperceptible in fancier quarters, such as parts of the Senate and most House leadership offices. And the change is unevenly distributed because every office on the Hill is essentially its own fiefdom, with its own standards
					for professional attire. But the shift is real—and it extends far beyond fashion.</p>
				<p>After more than a year of working remotely, often in sweats or shorts, “I don’t care to put on form-fitting pants anymore,” one senior staffer to a Democratic House lawmaker told me. Like many other offices, at least on the Democratic side, this
					staffer’s team transitioned back to in-person work in early summer. “It is not the same place it once was, where everyone feels like they have to be buttoned-up all the time,” he said. The senior staffer and his colleagues have started dressing more
					informally around the office, occasionally wearing black jeans, sneakers, and short-sleeved shirts without ties. It’s still bad form to interact with members or show up to the House floor looking like you’re at a Miami nightclub. But it’s happened.
					Once, the senior staffer wore shorts and a short-sleeved shirt to the Hill, expecting to spend most of the day at his desk. Then, at the last minute, he was called to the floor to bring something to his boss. On the way, lots of people witnessed his
					ultracasual look. Representative Madison Cawthorn, the 26-year-old Republican from North Carolina, stopped to shake his hand. The staffer was embarrassed, but the feeling wore off quickly. “Ever since that moment, I was like,
					<em>I don’t care</em>,” he said. Now that autumn is here, he’s opting for turtlenecks and blazers.</p>
				<p>The changes only go so far. Most of the Hill employees I interviewed for this story requested anonymity because they didn’t want their bosses to be associated with a story about what is widely—and incorrectly—viewed as a frivolous topic. But
					dress-code tweaks can have real economic and political impacts. Dressing more casually—say, investing in just one or two Bonobos suits instead of several—will save chronically underpaid Hill staffers money. Congressional positions, which have
					traditionally been dominated by the children of the wealthiest Americans, might become more widely accessible to poor and middle-class people. Another House aide to a Democrat told me that, before the pandemic, she wore pumps and dresses to work
					every day. Now that she’s back in the office, she wears mostly ballet flats and pants to escort her boss to meetings. Her colleagues are doing the same, opting for Rothy’s ankle boots instead of heels, and cozy fall sweaters instead of button-down
					blouses. Some aides wear leggings on recess days. “You’re keeping dry-cleaning bills down,” she told me. “You’re having things that meet multiple functions. That’s been helpful on the budget.” She’s started wearing a lot less makeup, too, switching
					from a cream foundation to a powder bronzer because it provides lighter coverage and doesn’t rub off under her mask. “I’m still always professional and put-together,” she said. But “I’ve been prioritizing flexibility.”</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/06/burn-all-the-leggings/618710/?utm_source=feed">Read: What do you wear to the reopening of society?</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>Not all Hill aides are wearing leggings to work. Just like the states they represent, each office in Congress is governed by its own set of rules. Some members view their staff as a reflection of themselves: Lawmakers in leadership roles demand a
					classy entourage. Lawmakers who
					<em>want</em>
					leadership roles require their staff to look the part. Many Hill aides simply don’t want to go casual, arguing that dressing up is part of the job when you work in the seat of American democracy. People don’t think very highly of Congress to begin
					with, one aide to a Republican senator told me. Why make it worse? “Government officials ought to keep a certain level of decorum as people that are creating our laws,” he said.</p>
				<p>The Hill’s enhanced casualness is more visible among staffers for Democrats than for Republicans, according to the employees I interviewed, given that more GOP offices worked in person during the pandemic. An even more glaring fashion divide
					between the parties is that, on the House side where masks are required, Democratic aides generally wear them and Republican aides usually don’t. “In normal times, everybody’s wearing their business attire and you don’t know who’s a Republican or a
					Democrat,” Patrick Malone, the communications director for Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, told me. “Now the battle lines are clearly drawn.”</p>
				<p>The Hill’s sartorial evolution has coincided with a bigger and potentially longer-lasting shift: Congress is tech-savvy now—or at least savvier than before. The pandemic forced lawmakers to learn how to use videoconferencing tools such as Cisco
					Webex and Zoom for remote hearings and committee meetings. These tools allowed witnesses to testify from anywhere, and lawmakers to do more TV hits on news stations in their own district without having to fly home. Members of Congress are now able to
					sign onto bills electronically, something they couldn’t do before. And House leadership
					<a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/05/21/proxy-voting-turns-one-the-past-present-and-future-of-remote-voting-in-the-house/">expanded the use of proxy voting during the pandemic</a>, which members from both sides of the aisle have
					used throughout the past 19 months. “Implementing technology like that should have been done years ago,” Representative Derek Kilmer, the chair of the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, told me this week. Before COVID, many offices
					didn’t even have laptops or videoconferencing. “There’s a meeting back in my district tonight that I wouldn’t have been able to participate in,” he said. “That can and should be here to stay.”</p>
				<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link">
					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/09/work-from-home-numbers/620107/?utm_source=feed">Read: Another truth about remote work</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>The pandemic has proved that many American workers can do their jobs just as well from home—and that includes congressional staff. Sure, remote work has some downsides: Politics is a business best conducted in person. But the aides I spoke with
					all hope to retain a remote-work option, even after the virus clears. Writing speeches and doing research are easier without all the background noise of a congressional office—the ringing phones and C-SPAN blaring from three different computers.
					Plus, people appreciate the flexibility. “I have a 40-minute commute each way, and if I don’t do that, I can start earlier or work later,” Malone said. “If I need to change the laundry, I can do that.”</p>
				<p>Remote work has allowed staffers to escape the Beltway more frequently, and experience a healthy jolt of reality. “It’s good to be outside this place, because you begin to think what’s in
					<em>Politico</em>
					Playbook or
					<em>Punchbowl</em>
					is actually what people are talking about,” the senior staffer said. “The time you get to spend out there is great for your ability to legislate and message. You can [ask]: ‘How’s the child tax credit affecting your family? Are you feeling it?’” Some
					offices have even been hiring interns and aides to work remotely, opening up a world of opportunity for people who can’t afford to live in one of the most expensive cities in America.</p>
				<p>The virus suddenly and aggressively dragged Congress into the 21st century. But the institution still has a long way to go. Although some members have embraced Blundstones in the office and hired interns to clock in from 600 miles away, others
					have been much, much slower to adapt. “If you want Congress to modernize completely, you need some umbrella rules that everyone has to follow,” the senior staffer said. By now, he added, “my office is as modern as it can go … But I don’t have that
					hope for all offices.” It’ll take more than a global pandemic to make that kind of change.</p>

					<strong>
						<em>This article contains spoilers through the seventh episode of
						</em>
					</strong>
					<strong>Succession<em>
							Season 3.</em>
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>Given how this season of
					<em>Succession
					</em>has gone so far, the Roy siblings should have reason to celebrate. They
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/11/succession-season-3-episode-5/620701/?utm_source=feed">held on to</a>
					control of the family’s company, Waystar Royco, after a Hail Mary negotiation. They helped choose the Republicans’ next presidential nominee from the comfort of their father’s hotel suite. And in tonight’s episode, they hear that the Department of
					Justice is considering dialing back its criminal investigation of the family conglomerate. Clearly, Kendall (played by Jeremy Strong) can’t choose a better time to throw himself the “fucking best birthday ever.”</p>
				<p>Unsurprisingly, he turns out to be horribly wrong. The reason lies in
					<em>Succession</em>’s thesis: Money has bought these characters everything
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/11/succession-season-3-episode-6/620765/?utm_source=feed">except an ounce of real joy</a>. Even when the Roys have a party, they’re surrounded by yes-men, opportunists, and, worst of all, one
					another. The siblings have been taught that happiness comes only from attaining more power and wealth, so backstabbing and insulting others is second nature to them, even at festivities. From this setup—toxic people in a gilded cage—the HBO drama has
					repeatedly mined both laughs and schadenfreude, and at times the series has felt like it’s spinning its
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/succession-season-3-review/620397/?utm_source=feed">thematic wheels</a>. Yet in examining the siblings’ maliciousness over the course of a single, cursed night, this latest episode captures in close-up the horror of the family’s perpetual cycle of pettiness and empty triumphs.</p>

				<p>Kendall’s party, after all, provides the perfect playground for egos to get hurt—especially his own. With the help of his PR team, he populates the venue with a nursery-themed section dedicated to his birth, a tree house honoring his childhood,
					and a room full of oversize fake tabloid covers disparaging his siblings. These lavish decorations—along with a plan to perform Billy Joel’s “Honesty”—are meant to keep the spotlight on him amid his war against his father, Logan (Brian Cox). But by
					the end of the night, his image-burnishing attempts leave him vulnerable and paranoid, obsessing over whether the DJ’s using the “approved playlist.” Kendall has set himself up to fail again; his showboating only heightens
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/succession-season-3-episode-3/620559/?utm_source=feed">his insecurity</a>. In the end, his 40th birthday results in a canceled performance and a room full of meaningless presents, while the gift he’s looking for—something handmade by his children—is nowhere to be found.</p>
				<p>The show illustrates how misery can be contagious: Naturally, Kendall takes his woes out on Shiv (Sarah Snook) and Roman (Kieran Culkin). When he learns that they’re attending his party not to celebrate him but to woo Lukas Matsson (Alexander
					Skarsg​​ård), the CEO of a streaming service Waystar Royco wants to acquire, he revokes their access to the tree house, in which Lukas is hanging out. Shiv, discouraged to learn that her father favors Roman, and secretly unhappy about her husband,
					Tom (Matthew Macfadyen), not being sent to prison, ends up drunk on the dance floor. Her apathy toward Tom deepens his (partly drug-induced) despair, and he winds up inside a “compliment tunnel” where party employees deliver flattery to the guests.
					There, Tom grows angrier, as he feels even less deserving of his luck in avoiding jail time, and he subsequently picks a fight with Cousin Greg.
					<em>Succession
					</em>thus depicts its characters’ joylessness as a domino effect: One slight begets another, then another, until Kendall’s party feels like an inescapable labyrinth of gloom.</p>

					<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/11/succession-season-3-episode-4/620633/?utm_source=feed">Read: The soul in Cousin Greg’s linguistic blunders</a>]</i>
				</p>
				<p>Among the party’s forlorn guests, Roman is the exception, because he doesn’t hide his motives or deny that being a Roy means being merciless and spiteful. He barges into the tree house, secures a meeting with Lukas, and embraces his role as
					Logan’s new lackey. He intensifies his obnoxiousness, taunting Kendall, Shiv, and Connor. In Roman’s scenes, the show underlines how far a Roy has to go to feel some semblance of fulfillment: Rather than trying to shake off the demons, he embraces
					them, and consequently he’s the only one who walks out of Kendall’s bash looking unscathed.</p>
				<p>As a Roy, there’s a lot to celebrate but very little to feel happy about. Turning 40, having a partner, making career strides, or experiencing any kind of personal growth, really, fails to matter. The bleak reality is that most of the Roys can’t
					have the only thing they want—control of the family company—while Logan remains alive. Perhaps that’s why Logan is the only Roy to indulge in any genuine celebration in this episode. When he learns of the DOJ’s new stance, he raises a glass of
					champagne, toasts “justice,” and looks like the most satisfied man in the world.</p>

					<i>Illustrations by Miki Lowe</i>
				</p>
				<p dir="ltr">Childhood is a fruitful source of inspiration for artists, but some return to it more than others. The poet Marie Howe is one of them. She grew up in a large Catholic family, the oldest of nine siblings and one of 100 first cousins; she
					<a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/marie-howe-the-power-of-words-to-save-us-may2017/#transcript">said in 2017</a>
					that family is “where everything happens.” If the image that comes to mind is a hectic and happy,
					<em>Cheaper by the Dozen</em>–type household, you should read her poems: The vignettes she paints can be dark. Several family members struggled with alcoholism, which wrought violence and chaos. And in 1989, her
					<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2020/12/poem-marie-howe-what-living-do/617527/?utm_source=feed">brother Johnny died</a>
					of AIDS-related complications at age 28.
				</p>
				<p dir="ltr">In the same 2017 interview, Howe said that shared trauma—and alcoholism, in particular—eventually pulled her family apart. “As much as you want to be all in the same room, the nature of that illness fragments any unifying understanding,”
					she said. In her poem “The Game,” she revisits a moment before her family splintered, when her brothers and sisters created their own imaginary world. They could be whoever they wanted to be: All nine of them were together, none lost, and time was in
					their control. It’s a sweet memory, and a foreboding one. The game is so oddly specific, in the way that kids’ inventions often are, that it almost feels like the siblings could stay insulated in it forever. But outside their basement town, the clock
					works differently. Their world is still frozen in time—in the pages of this magazine—yet the real children are no longer in it.</p>

				<content type="html">
					<p>In David Mamet’s film
						<em>State and Main</em>, a Hollywood big shot tries to shortchange a set hand by offering him an “associate producer” credit on a movie. A screenwriter overhears the exchange and asks, “What’s an ‘associate producer credit’?” The big shot answers:
						“It’s what you give your secretary instead of a raise.”</p>
					<p>The practice of “land acknowledgment”—preceding a fancy event by naming the Indigenous groups whose slaughter and dispossession cleared the land on which the audience’s canapés are about to be served—is one of the greatest associate-producer
						credits of all time. A land acknowledgment is what you give when you have no intention of giving land. It is like a receipt provided by a highway robber, noting all the jewels and gold coins he has stolen. Maybe it will be useful for an insurance
						claim? Anyway, you are not getting your jewels back, but now you have documentation.</p>
					<p>Long common in Canada and Australia, land acknowledgment is catching on in the United States and already de rigueur in certain circles. If you have seen enough of these—I have now watched dozens, sometimes more than one at the same event—you learn
						to spot them before the speaker even begins acknowledging. In many cases the tone turns solemn and moralizing, and the speaker’s posture stiff, as if preparing to read a confession at gunpoint. One might declare before, say, a corporate sales
						retreat:
						<em>We would like to respectfully acknowledge that the land on which we gather to discuss the new line of sprinkler systems is in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq.</em>
						The acknowledgment is almost always a prepared statement, read verbatim, because like all spells it must be spoken precisely for its magic to work. The magic in this case is self-absolution: The acknowledgment relieves the speaker and the audience of
						the responsibility to think about Indigenous peoples, at least until the next public event.</p>

					</p>
					<p>Thanksgiving relies on a cartoon version of the settlement of the Americas, focusing on a moment of concord between victim and
						<em>génocidaire</em>. Land acknowledgments are similarly confected to stroke the sentiments of mostly non-Indigenous audiences—this time by enabling their preening self-criticism.
					</p>
					<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft’s annual Ignite conference began with a
						<a href="https://youtu.be/PraEcNDGSqY?t=301">land acknowledgment</a>
						so bewildering to viewers that it went briefly viral. But it was not abnormal among statements of this sort. The emcee acknowledged that the company’s headquarters, one square mile of land outside Seattle, was “occupied by the Sammamish, Duwamish,
						Snoqualmie, Suquamish, Muckleshoot, Snohomish, Tulalip, and other coast Salish people... since time immemorial.” She noted that the tribes are “still there” but offered no connection between the past and today. Few if any of the baffled viewers would
						deny the historic presence of these peoples amid the sacred groves that later produced PowerPoint and Clippy, the Microsoft Word mascot. But in the absence of context, the effect of this parade of names was to suggest that for thousands of years the
						Indigenous peoples were crammed onto the Microsoft campus uncomfortably like canned salmon, doing who knows what, until Bill Gates arrived in the late 20th century to turn them into programmers.</p>
					<p>Maybe it is a victory for Indigeneity to have the name Muckleshoot even mentioned at a Microsoft conference. By far the most common defense of land acknowledgments is that they harm no one, and they educate Americans about a hidden history that
						took place literally where they stand. Do they not at least do that?</p>
					<p>No, not even a little. It is difficult to exaggerate the superficiality of these statements. What do members of the acknowledged group hold sacred? What makes them unique and identifies them to one another? Who are they, where did they come from,
						and where are they going? The evasion of these fundamental questions is typical. The speaker demonstrates no knowledge of the people whose names he reads carefully off the sheet of paper. Nor does he make any but the most general connection between
						the event and those people, other than an ancient one, not too different from the speaker’s relationship with the local geology or flora.</p>
					<p>At ceremonies and events in my home city of New Haven, Connecticut, I have heard acknowledgment that we are on “Quinnipiac land.” This statement is never accompanied by mention of the basic fact that the Quinnipiac all but ceased to exist as a
						people more than 150 years ago, and there is no currently recognized Quinnipiac tribe. I suspect that few in the audience know this, and that few of the speakers do. (There is an “Algonquian Confederacy of the Quinnipiac Tribal Council.” Its leader,
						<a href="https://www.houstoniamag.com/news-and-city-life/2014/07/iron-thunderhorse-wanted-by-the-law-july-2014">Iron Thunderhorse</a>, is currently in prison in Texas for rape, and projected to be released in
						<a href="https://inmate.tdcj.texas.gov/InmateSearch/viewDetail.action?sid=02408848">2051</a>, at the age of 107. He is half-Italian, was born William Coppola, and according to a
						<a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1064754714734954829&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;as_sdt=6&amp;amp;as_vis=1&amp;amp;oi=scholarr">legal filing</a>
						by the Texas prison authority, was not listed as Native American on at least one of his purported birth certificates.)</p>
					<p>Some people argue that land acknowledgments are “gestures of respect.” I’m not sure one can show respect while also being indifferent to a people’s existence. The statements are a counterfeit version of respect.
						<em>Teen Vogue</em>
						<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/indigenous-land-acknowledgement-explained">put it well</a>, if unintentionally: “Land acknowledgment is an easy way to show honor and respect to the indigenous people.” A great deal of nonsense about identity
						politics could be avoided by studying this line, and realizing that respect shown the “easy way” is just as cheap as it sounds. Real respect occurs only when accompanied by time, work, or something else of value. Learning basic facts about a
						particular tribe might be a start.</p>
					<p>Most of these acknowledgments are considered (by the speakers, anyway) moral acts, because they bear witness to crimes perpetrated against Native peoples and call, usually implicitly, for redress. If you enjoy moral exhibitionism, to say nothing
						of moral onanism, land acknowledgments in their current form will leave you pleasured for years to come. (Cartoon history serves this purpose well; reality, less so. Do you acknowledge the Quinnipiac, or the tribes they at times allied with the
						English to fight? Or both?) The acknowledgments never include any actual material redress—return of land, meaningful corrections of wrongs against Indigenous communities—or sophisticated moral reckoning. Nor is there an “easy way” to reckon with this
						past. In the early 1600s, as many as 90 percent of the Quinnipiac were
						<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2957993/">wiped out</a>, along with other coastal Native Americans, by chicken pox and other diseases imported by Europeans. How does one assign blame for the spread of disease, hundreds of years
						before anyone knew diseases were something other than the wrath of God? (Does China owe Europe reparations for the Black Death, which came, like COVID-19, from Hubei? Or should China take two Opium Wars and call it even?)</p>
					<p>Without time, work, or actual redress, the land acknowledgment that implies a moral debt amounts to the highwayman’s receipt. “To acknowledge Indigenous homelands and to return those lands are related, but the former alone allows for rhetoric
						without further action,” Dustin Tahmahkera, a professor of Native American cultural studies at the University of Oklahoma, told me. If Microsoft truly felt bad about the location of its offices, it could move its operations to soil less blood-soaked.
						(There aren’t many such places, alas.) Not every Microsoft conference needs to be an announcement of a real-estate deal. But if Microsoft is going to acknowledge a debt, it should also pay it.

					</p>
					<p>If the practice of land acknowledgment persists, it should do so in a version less embarrassing to all involved. I would propose restricting such acknowledgments to forms and occasions that preserve their dignity and power.</p>
					<p></p>
					<p>Follow these rules, and object to any land acknowledgments that violate them:</p>
					<p></p>
					<ul>
						<li>The acknowledgment should reveal a specific relationship between the event and the people who are acknowledged. Boilerplate language is an insult.</li>
						<li>It should not smell of self-congratulation, either by the speaker or the institution. If it makes you look good, you are doing it wrong. Note that one form of self-congratulation is pedantic self-criticism.</li>
						<li>If the acknowledgment calls for restitution, it should specify the reasons for the restitution and the means for making it. If you think land should be given back or other payment made, say so. Venture a magnitude of the repayment and explain
							why. Even the highwayman’s receipt lists the jewels and coins taken.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>These reforms in land acknowledgment would leave plenty of cynicism to go around—nearly all warranted, I think. Land acknowledgments are a classic culture-war issue, Nick Estes, an American-studies professor at the University of New Mexico, told
						me via email. They can be “a pantomime of caring or outrage mostly by professional class elites and educational institutions.” Meanwhile, he asked, what of “the real issues facing Indigenous peoples—housing, employment, child removal, generational
						poverty, lack of adequate healthcare, police violence, racism, and erasure; in other words, real colonialism”?</p>
					<p>Land acknowledgments are just words, and words can distract from real issues, in particular the ultimate one, which is Native American tribal sovereignty. But some words are honest, even loving, and others are hollow and nauseating. As an
						American, and as a once and future member of an audience at ceremonies and events, I would be thankful for more of the former and fewer of the latter.</p>

				<id>tag:theatlantic.com,2021:50-620828</id>
				<content type="html">
					<p dir="ltr">Back in 2020, I might’ve imagined the end of the pandemic being something like that
						<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxm7Hu-IHJs">gum commercial</a>: everyone together, vaccinated, picking the same time to come safely and communally out of lockdown and get back to the way things were before, so grateful to be alive we
						practically leapt into one another’s arms as soon as we got the chance. That is not, of course, the way
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/omicron-coronavirus-variant-what-we-know/620827/?utm_source=feed">things have gone in 2021</a>. But the closest I’ve felt to that gum-commercial feeling came from being in the audience at
						the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on a recent Monday night, an experience I’ve played and replayed in my head since learning that Stephen Sondheim died suddenly on Friday at 91.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">November 15 was the reopening night for Sondheim’s
						<em>Company</em>, which had abruptly ceased previews in mid-March 2020. This production, directed by Marianne Elliott, had previously run in London, and it makes the formerly male protagonist of the show, Bobby, a female Bobbie instead. My colleague
						Sophie Gilbert has aptly
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/10/rosalie-craig-and-patti-lupone-shine-in-a-gender-flipped-company/573262/?utm_source=feed">described</a>
						Elliott’s reimagining of the musical as “a kind of 21st-century Lewis Carroll fever dream.” Bobbie becomes our latter-day Alice, a disoriented but intrepid navigator trying to make sense of the strangeness of contemporary bourgeois life. In that way,
						it is sort of a perfect show for right now, when a lot of us feel a bit like observers trying to relocate our place as participants in the world. “It’s much better living it than looking at it,” Bobbie’s friends say. They’re talking about love and
						marriage, but the line takes on a more expansive meaning during a pandemic. In the audience, it was hard not to feel elated to be living.</p>
					<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr">
						<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/10/rosalie-craig-and-patti-lupone-shine-in-a-gender-flipped-company/573262/?utm_source=feed">Sophie Gilbert: Marianne Elliott’s gender-flipped Company mines modern ambivalence about marriage</a>]</i>
					</p>
					<p dir="ltr">The nervous excitement in the crowd reminded me of the opening-night energy at a school musical, every member of the audience hoping for the best, just so proud and happy to be there. These were the die-hards, people who had waited
						throughout the pandemic for this moment. An older man and woman in the row ahead of me compared notes on the many versions of the show they’d seen over the years; the two people next to me kept turning to each other and shrieking. Every seat had a
						shiny party hat on it, and audience members gamely strapped them on—a nod to the evening’s celebratory mood and to the surprise birthday party at the center of the show.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">At first, when some people stood up and started clapping, I was confused; the show wasn’t starting yet. Then a few more joined, and soon most of the theater was standing, facing a row in the middle of the orchestra section. Sondheim
						himself was taking his seat for the evening.
						<em>How did he look?</em>
						everyone I later told about the performance wanted to know.
						<em>Did he seem well?</em>
					</p>
					<p>From the few, partial glimpses I caught of Sondheim from the mezzanine, he seemed better than well, smiling wide enough you could tell despite the mask. (He doesn’t seem to have been ill; indeed, he
						<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/theater/stephen-sondheim-dead.html">reportedly enjoyed a Thanksgiving dinner</a>
						with friends the night before he died.) He was so very alive, in fact, applauding so joyfully after every number, that his presence was utterly reassuring: We had, all of us, made it through. We could be surrounded, once again, by hundreds of
						strangers and not fear for our lives. It was tempting to think that everything, maybe, would actually be okay, and this genius composer who never really aged would live forever to help guide us through the difficult, confusing times ahead.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">I’m sure Sondheim knew better, though. He never believed in simple happy endings, but he knew exactly how to take advantage of his audience’s yearning for them. In
						<em>Into the Woods</em>, for which he wrote the music and lyrics, the characters end Act I singing the jaunty “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TFcsAEEJTI">Ever After</a>,” blissfully unsuspecting of the complications that await them in the second act.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">Sondheim’s work was at its strongest when it lingered in the pain of the dawning realization that no
						<em>ever after</em>
						ever lasts long. His music and lyrics looked squarely at life and insisted, gently and eloquently, that of course it was never going to be exactly how we wanted it to be, that messiness and ambiguity were to be expected, and could even be part of the
						beauty. Voices overlapped, words whizzed by, anxiety and sorrow and joy were written into the very structure of the songs. “I put it in as low a key as possible,” Sondheim once said of the opening of
						<em>Sweeney Todd</em>. “Always with a slight crescendo, so there’s always a little leaning in, as if something’s about to happen and then doesn’t. The feeling is of lifting the audience a little bit and then dropping, lifting and dropping.” I saw him
						give this explanation in a 2004 PBS documentary, but the footage is clearly from an unspecified time long before 2004.</p>

					</p>
					<p>He said it casually, as though this lifting and dropping of thousands of human beings were the easiest thing in the world to pull off. But to see Sondheim solely as a magician would be to miss the point. “Art isn’t easy” the refrain in
						<em>Sunday in the Park With George</em>
						goes. Sondheim loved collaborating, his
						<em>New York Times</em>
						<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/theater/stephen-sondheim-dead.html">obituary</a>
						says, but he often worked alone, late into the night, when writing or composing.
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/10/rosalie-craig-and-patti-lupone-shine-in-a-gender-flipped-company/573262/?utm_source=feed">He wasn’t necessarily convinced</a>
						by
						<em>Company</em>’s conclusion that being alone is incompatible with being truly alive. Or maybe, unlike so many generations of devoted theatergoers, he just didn’t see that as the show’s true conclusion.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">Before
						<em>Company</em>, Sondheim said in the 2004 documentary, musicals “would always lead to the so-called happy ending. We were saying something ambiguous, which is ‘Actually, there are no endings’; it keeps going on is what, really,
						<em>Company</em>’s about.”</p>
					<p dir="ltr">The night
						<em>Company</em>
						reopened, Times Square was eerily empty. Just north of 42nd Street, I heard a man announce to no one in particular, “Now you will all watch me take a COVID test.” He swabbed himself and I kept walking. I spent the subway ride home anxious about all
						the unmasked people riding the C train with me. So much for the romantic optimism of Sondheim’s
						<a href="https://genius.com/Stephen-sondheim-another-hundred-people-lyrics">city of strangers</a>.</p>
					<p>Which, I guess, is the point: It keeps going on. We haven’t reached the pandemic’s
						<em>ever after
						</em>yet, and if we do it won’t be in a single glorious
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/americans-need-moving-next-phase-pandemic/620793/?utm_source=feed">moment</a>. Cases are rising, again. A

						has arrived, about which we know little. Sondheim has departed. But
						<em>Company</em>’s run goes on too; you can watch it on 45th Street this winter, if you wear your mask. There are no endings.</p>

				<content type="html">
					<p dir="ltr">As fall dips into winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the coronavirus has served up the holiday gift that no one, absolutely no one, asked for: a new
						<a href="https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/">variant of concern</a>,
						<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern">dubbed Omicron by the World Health Organization on Friday</a>.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">Omicron, also known as B.1.1.529, was first detected in Botswana and South Africa earlier this month, and very little is known about it so far. But the variant is moving fast. South Africa, the country that initially flagged Omicron to
						WHO this week, has experienced a surge of new cases—some
						<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03552-w">reportedly in people who were previously infected or vaccinated</a>—and the virus has already spilled across international borders into places such as Hong Kong, Belgium, Israel, and the
						United Kingdom. Several nations are now selectively shutting down travel to impede further spread. For instance, on Monday, the United States will
						<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/26/world/americas/us-travel-restrictions-new-covid-variant-omicron.html">start restricting travel</a>
						from Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Malawi.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">It’s a lot of news to process, and it comes without a lot of baseline knowledge about the virus itself. Scientists around the world are still scrambling to gather intel on three essential metrics: how quickly the variant spreads; if it’s
						capable of causing more serious disease; and whether it might be able to circumvent the immune protection left behind by past SARS-CoV-2 infections or COVID-19 vaccines, or evade immune-focused treatments such as monoclonal antibodies. All are risks
						because of the sheer number of mutations Omicron appears to have picked up:
						<a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Implications-emergence-spread-SARS-CoV-2%20B.1.1.529-variant-concern-Omicron-for-the-EU-EEA-Nov2021.pdf">More than 30 of them</a>
						are in SARS-CoV-2’s spike protein, the multi-tool the virus uses to crack its way into human cells—and the snippet of the pathogen that’s the central focus of nearly all of the world’s COVID-19 vaccines. Alterations like these have been spotted in
						other troublesome variants, including Alpha and Delta, both of which used their super-speedster properties to blaze across the globe. (Omicron is only a
						<a href="https://nextstrain.org/ncov/gisaid/africa">distant cousin</a>
						of both, not a direct descendant.) If—<em>if</em>—Omicron moves even faster than its predecessors, we could be in for another serious pandemic gut punch.</p>

						<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/coronavirus-evolution-vaccines/619875/?utm_source=feed">Read: The coronavirus could get worse</a>]</i>
					</p>
					<p dir="ltr">But it’s way too early to know if that’ll be the case. What’s known so far absolutely warrants
						<em>attention</em>—not panic. Viruses mutate; they always do. Not all variants of concern turn out to be, well, all that
						<em>concerning</em>; many end up being mere blips in the pandemic timeline. As Omicron knocks up against its viral competitors, it may struggle to gain a toehold; it could yet be quelled through a combination of vaccines and infection-prevention measures such as
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/07/cdc-coronavirus-masks-vaccines-indoors/619592/?utm_source=feed">masks</a>
						and distancing.
						<a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-strategy-address-omicron-b11529-sars-cov-2">Vaccine makers</a>
						have already
						<a href="https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1464225637590310938">announced plans</a>
						to test their shots’ effectiveness against the new variant—with data to emerge in the coming weeks—and explore new dosing strategies that might help tamp down its spread. Omicron might be set up for some success, but a lot of its future also depends
						on us.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">To help put Omicron in perspective, I caught up with Boghuma Kabisen Titanji, an infectious-disease physician, virologist, and global-health expert at Emory University. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.</p>
					<hr class="c-section-divider"/>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Katherine J. Wu:</strong>
						Why don’t we yet know for sure how worried we need to be about Omicron?</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Boghuma Kabisen Titanji:</strong>
						What we do know about the variant is this: Some of its spike-protein mutations have been seen in other variants and other lineages described earlier on in the pandemic, and have been associated with increased transmissibility and the ability of the
						virus to evade the immune response. What we
						<em>don’t</em>
						know, and what is really hard to predict, is what the
						<em>combination</em>
						of mutations will do together. This particular variant now appears to be outcompeting other circulating variants in South Africa—there have been these clusters of cases. That is actually what led to this variant being identified in the surveillance
						systems that they have in place there. That raises the concern that the variant is more transmissible or may be escaping the effects of the immune response induced by vaccines or infection from earlier strains. But we really don’t know that for sure
						yet.</p>
					<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr">
						<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/coronavirus-tests-variants/619112/?utm_source=feed">Read: Coronavirus variants have nowhere to hide</a>]</i>
					</p>
					<p dir="ltr">The disconnect is this: The surveillance systems have worked exactly in the way they are designed to. It makes us know what to look out for. However, when these systems pick up a signal, we don’t immediately get the epidemiologic data we
						need to know all of the impacts a new variant can have. That takes time. Right now, we have a limited number of [viral genomic] sequences, and a limited number of cases. Now the alert is out. People will start looking for this new variant, not only
						in the countries that initially reported on this, but now worldwide. There’s now a search to make sure this variant is well-characterized. That’s when we will gain a better understanding of
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/06/coronavirus-evolution-virulence/619301/?utm_source=feed">whether it’s causing more severe disease</a>, how much it is escaping immunity, and how transmissible it is.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">It’s important to keep in mind that other variants of concern have emerged before, including immune-evasive variants like Beta, which was first identified in South Africa, but eventually petered out.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Wu:</strong>
						Could we have seen the arrival of Omicron coming?</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Titanji:</strong>
						Viruses are going to evolve regardless of what we do. There are things we can do to slow that down: barrier measures [such as masking], vaccinating. And there are things that we can do that can maybe speed up or aid the evolution of the virus. One is
						if we’re not doing what we need to do to prevent spread of the virus within the population. Every time a virus spreads, it gets another opportunity to infect a new host, and it gets another opportunity to evolve and change and adapt.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">All of this means that it is worth having a conversation about whether the slow rollout of vaccines globally has had an impact. In certain parts of the world, not enough people have been given a measure of protection to allow them to be
						able to withstand infection, and to slow down transmission of the virus. Are we actually giving the virus an opportunity to spread unrestricted in certain places and drive its evolutionary trend? It’s basically exposing ourselves to the emergence of
						more variants. So this
						<em>was</em>
						predictable. If the virus has the opportunity to spread unchecked in the population, then we’re giving it multiple ways in which to evolve and adapt.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">If we had ensured that everyone had equal access to vaccination and really pushed the agenda on getting global vaccination to a high level, then maybe we could have possibly delayed the emergence of new variants, such as the ones that
						we’re witnessing.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Wu:</strong>
						We’re still dealing with Delta, a previous variant of concern. Where do we go from here?</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Titanji:</strong>
						A good place to start is reminding people that we are definitely not where we were two years ago, when SARS-CoV-2 emerged. We now have a better understanding of how the virus is transmitted from person to person. We have
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/mercks-experimental-covid-pill-cant-fix-everything/620320/?utm_source=feed">antivirals</a>
						that are coming down the pike. We have a better understanding of how to manage and treat cases of people who do get infected. We have vaccines and incredible
						<a href="https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-strategy-address-omicron-b11529-sars-cov-2">mRNA technology that allows us to adapt quickly to a changing virus</a>, and we will have
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/05/spike-protein-vaccines-covid/618954/?utm_source=feed">second-generation vaccines</a>. It’s definitely not back to square one.</p>
					<p data-id="injected-recirculation-link" dir="ltr">
						<i>[<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/mercks-experimental-covid-pill-cant-fix-everything/620320/?utm_source=feed">Read: Timing is everything for Merck’s COVID pill</a>]</i>
					</p>
					<p dir="ltr">Secondly, this does not mean that the vaccines that people have are now completely useless—the doses they have received are not null and void. We have not yet seen a variant of concern emerge that has been able to completely escape the
						effect of vaccines. The immunity from the vaccines may be less protective, which may translate into more

						from a new variant, if it takes off. But that is yet to be determined.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">We also know that a
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/booster-shot-better-name/620300/?utm_source=feed">booster dose</a>
						really does boost the antibody response. A new variant could dent the [protection offered by the immune system], but that
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/antibody-evolution/618004/?utm_source=feed">usually happens in degrees</a>. There is still going to be immune responsiveness from previous immunizations, and
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/infection-immunity-covid-19-vaccines/620099/?utm_source=feed">infections from ancestral versions of the virus</a>. It may simply mean that you need more of those antibodies to be able to neutralize that new variant of concern. We also have T cells, which play a role and may not be as impacted by the variant.</p>

					</p>
					<p dir="ltr">This variant could not have chosen a worse time to emerge. We’re in
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/09/flu-season-2021/620163/?utm_source=feed">flu season</a>. This is a time when respiratory viruses tend to
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/covid-seasonal-winter/620766/?utm_source=feed">spread quite efficiently</a>. And we are in the
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/coronavirus-tests-thanksgiving/620663/?utm_source=feed">holiday season</a>, and there’s a lot of traveling, and a lot of people getting together with family. But it’s certainly not the time
						for people to let their guard down, or relax on nonpharmaceutical interventions. People have to be mindful of wearing their mask when they’re out in public, or in crowded areas with people whose vaccination status they may not know. People have to be
						mindful of
						<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/coronavirus-testing-still-confusing/620783/?utm_source=feed">getting tested when they feel unwell</a>, and isolating appropriately and doing all of those things that we have learned how to
						do over the course of the past two years, and that we know are effective in mitigating the spread of virus. The same measures will still work while we figure out just what this new variant means for us. Get your boosters. We’ll figure it out.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Wu:</strong>
						Several countries instituted travel bans this week, many of them primarily focused on African countries, where surveillance systems detected Omicron not long ago. How big of an impact might that make?</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Titanji:</strong>
						Historically, there is a lot of evidence that by the time a travel ban is instituted, the virus has already gone … and potentially well beyond the borders of the countries that [the ban is] restricting travel from. Instituting travel bans as a
						knee-jerk reaction can send the wrong message to countries that are contributing to the global effort of virus surveillance. We could end up disincentivizing countries from reporting because they fear retaliation. There are other measures that could
						be taken to ensure that travel is safe. For example, to get an international flight, you have to be fully vaccinated as a requirement for most countries, or show proof of negative tests.</p>
					<p dir="ltr">We will be better served if we put the emphasis on the countries that have seen the highest number of cases of this new emerging variant: providing them with the resources to actually contain the variant, and making sure that they have
						the resources for testing, for isolating cases, for doing the science that we need to better understand Omicron.</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Wu:</strong>
						Some countries are already deep into their rollout of booster shots, and have, in recent months, lifted many restrictions; others are still barely making a dent in administering
						<em>first</em>
						doses. Regardless of where we go with Omicron, what does this say about our approach to COVID-19 as a global society?</p>
					<p dir="ltr">
						<strong>Titanji:</strong>
						What this reiterates is that the world is so interconnected. We are in a
						<em>global</em>
						pandemic, and we cannot address this fully if we only have regional solutions. The solutions really have to be with a global mindset. And that global mindset means that the resources we have—vaccination, testing, access to therapeutics, and also the
						support to carry out appropriate surveillance—need to be equally accessible and equitably distributed in all parts of the world.</p>

					</p>
					<p dir="ltr">We can’t leave people behind. The virus will catch up with us regardless of where you are, regardless of what country you’re located in. You may be fully vaccinated, you may have had your booster, but you’re not that disconnected from
						the person who lives in a country where only 2 percent of the population is vaccinated, and who doesn’t have access to any of the treatments. We need to have less of an inward-looking focus. Because otherwise we’re just going to prolong how long we
						stay in this pandemic.</p>
