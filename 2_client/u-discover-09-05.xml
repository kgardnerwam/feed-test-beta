														<p>Burgeoning star <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/stunna-4-vegas-the-one/">Stunna 4 Vegas</a></strong> continues his scorching run with the Icewear Vezzo-assisted &#x201C;BMF.&#x201D; After releasing a string of hearty tracks, Stunna taps his one-time production partner D.A. Got That Dope for the tuneful new track. The record is an incendiary effort by Stunna and Vezzo, who throw a barrage of punchlines to stun the competition.
</p><p>Along with releasing his new song, Stunna announced his new album <em>Rae Rae&#x2019;s Son</em>, which is slated to drop soon. This year, Stunna kept fans enthralled with his fiery streak, releasing songs like &#x201C;Pay Me To Speak,&#x201D; &#x201C;The One,&#x201D; and D.A. Got That Dope-produced track &#x201C;Suspect.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Stunna announced his new tour. Titled Rae Rae&#x2019;s Son Tour, Stunna will partake in a multi-city jaunt beginning this May and land in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas before his June 11 finale in Denver. YRB Teez and SSG Splurge will accompany the Billion Dollar Baby star on his trek.
</p><p>Since he joined Billion Dollar Baby and Interscope in 2019, Stunna 4 Vegas has emerged into one of the roster&#x2019;s most promising talents, with over 816 million streams in the U.S. alone. His frenetic energy and ear for top-tier street anthems launched the run of success that began with his <em>Big 4X</em> mixtape release that cracked the top 50 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.
</p><p>He built on that initial success with the January 2020 release of his debut album, <em>Rich Youngin</em>, which shot into the top 30 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and the top 20 of the Rap Albums list on the heels of hits such as &#x201C;DO DAT&#x201D; featuring DaBaby and Lil Baby and &#x201C;Up the Smoke&#x201D; with Offset. Stunna 4 Vegas kept grinding with a heavy touring lineup in 2021, including featured performer slots at Rolling Loud, Made in America, and OVO Fest, as well as headlining his own national tour.

														<p>Coming off of numerous highs including the announcement of his signing to Yo Gotti&#x2019;s CMG record label and his most recent album <em>Untreated Trauma</em> becoming his highest Billboard charting project to date (#19), Oak Park native <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/mozzy-cmg-real-ones-roddy-ricch/">Mozzy</a></strong> continues to push full steam ahead dropping visuals for his latest track &#x201C;Tell The Truth&#x201D; featuring Shordie Shordie.
</p><p>Set in his hometown stomping grounds, &#x201C;Tell The Truth&#x201D; holds true to Mozzy&#x2019;s signature street record anthems and paints a picture of unfiltered and harsh politics and realities of street life. The Suzy directed video sheds light on affiliates who present an unrealistic persona and presses them to be real with themselves. Tapping in Shordie Shordie for the head bobbing hook, Mozzy and the &#x201C;Bitchuary&#x201D; rapper last collaborated on &#x201C;So Lonely&#x201D; off of Mozzy&#x2019;s 2020 <em>Beyond Bulletproof</em> album.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/360_M39p_Mg?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/360_M39p_Mg?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>As one of the most respected lyricists in the genre, Mozzy&#x2019;s &#x201C;Tell The Truth&#x201D; follows his Roddy Rich assisted February release of &#x201C;Real Ones&#x201D; as well as <em>Untreated Trauma</em>, which also earned his first Billboard Top 10 R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart slot sliding in at number 10 respectively, and <em>Kommunity Service</em>, a joint project with YG.
</p><p>&#x201C;Real Ones&#x201D; underlines why Mozzy has been one of the most celebrated figures in rap for more than half a decade. In 2015, he began a mixtape run that many hip-hop fans point to as an all-time effort. As Complex wrote back then, &#x201C;This year alone the acclaimed artist released four solo full-lengths, several collaborative albums, and a flurry of flawless guest spots. In the process, he&#x2019;s built up a tremendous street buzz.&#x201D; Since then, Mozzy has dropped a number of groundbreaking releases, including 2015 mixtape <em>Bladadah</em>, and his 2017 studio debut, <em>1 Up Top Ahk</em>.
</p><p>With <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/est-gee-moneybagg-yo-bigger-than-life-or-death-deluxe/">Yo Gotti&#x2019;s CMG</a></strong> (Moneybagg Yo, 42 Dugg, EST Gee) by his side, Mozzy has the support needed to take his brilliant street tales and witty flexes to a much wider audience. New track like &#x201C;Tell The Truth&#x201D; and the massive, radio-ready &#x201C;Real Ones&#x201D; are important steps towards becoming one of the biggest names in rap.

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
														<p>Over the course of his six-decade-long career, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/dr-john-musical-legacy-and-influence/"><strong>Dr. John</strong></a> embodied a near-mythic multitude of musical identities: global ambassador of New Orleans funk and jazz and R&amp;B, visionary bluesman, rock and roll innovator, one-time top 10 hitmaker, self-anointed and massively revered high priest of psychedelic voodoo. On <em>Things Happen That Way</em>, due September 23, 2022, the six-time Grammy-winning Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Famer otherwise known as Malcolm John &#x201C;Mac&#x201D; Rebennack Jr. reveals yet another dimension of his cosmically vast musicality: a lifelong affinity for classic country &amp; western music.
</p><p><em>Things Happen That Way</em> arrives as the latest and final studio album from an artist who remained wholly unpredictable, alchemizing the charmed simplicity of traditional country into a wildly enchanting body of work.</p>
<p>The first single from the album &#x2013; a haunting and hypnotic new rendition of &#x201C;I Walk On Guilded Splinters&#x201D; (which originally appeared on Dr. John&#x2019;s ground-breaking 1968 debut<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/dr-john-musical-legacy-and-influence/"><strong><em> Gris- Gris</em></strong></a>) &#x2013; is out now. You can check it out below.
</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWxlUEgEbpk?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWxlUEgEbpk?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>Country-rock powerhouse Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real joined Dr. John for the newly recorded version of the classic track. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a great honor to attempt to interpret the work of Dr. John,&#x201D; says Lukas. &#x201C;His music has inspired me since childhood. He was a friend to many, and we all miss him dearly. His music is medicine.&#x201D;
</p><p><em>Things Happen That Way</em> marks the fulfilment of a longtime goal of the legendary singer/songwriter/pianist, who first began plotting a country inspired album decades ago. In bringing his album&#x2019;s songs to life, Dr. John drew on a line-up of musicians befitting of a universally beloved luminary. Along with an elite cadre of New Orleans session players, the album&#x2019;s personnel include icons <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/willie-nelson/"><strong>Willie Nelson</strong></a> and Aaron Neville, and rising stars Lukas Nelson &amp; Promise of the Real.
</p><p><em>Things Happen That Way</em> opens on the delicate surrender of the Willie Nelson-penned &#x201C;Funny How Time Slips Away,&#x201D; a track whose soulful harmonies and smoldering horns never overpower the sheer vulnerability of Dr. John&#x2019;s performance on piano and vocals.
</p><p>A co-conspirator of Rebennack&#x2019;s for countless years, Nelson shares a warm remembrance that perfectly encapsulates the album&#x2019;s transportive power: &#x201C;Dr. John had the most unique musical style and language that would take me to another time and place whenever I heard him play or sing.&#x201D;
</p><p>Spotlighting his endless ingenuity as a song interpreter, Dr. John also masterfully reimagines <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/hank-williams/"><strong>Hank Williams&#x2019;</strong></a> &#x201C;Ramblin&#x2019; Man&#x201D; and &#x201C;I&#x2019;m So Lonesome I Could Cry.&#x201D; Elsewhere on the album, Aaron Neville joins in for a joyfully brass-heavy take on The Traveling Wilburys&#x2019; &#x201C;End of the Line,&#x201D; while Willie Nelson lends his balm-like vocals and signature guitar work to a soul-stirring rendition of the traditional gospel song &#x201C;Gimme That Old Time Religion.&#x201D;
</p><p>Though much of <em>Things Happen That Way</em> bears an exquisitely reflective mood, the album also offers up several new uptempo originals from Dr. John: &#x201C;Holy Water&#x201D; (a savvy and poignant look back at his early-&#x2019;60s criminal charge for narcotics and subsequent two-year prison sentence, with backing vocals by Katie Pruitt), &#x201C;Sleeping Dogs Best Left Alone&#x201D; (a swinging and self-aware piece that knowingly speaks to the danger in playing with proverbial dynamite), and &#x201C;Give Myself A Good Talkin&#x2019; To&#x201D;(a world-weary but high-spirited reflection on the vicissitudes of human nature).

														<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/kendrick-lamar/">Kendrick Lamar</a></strong> has returned with &#x201C;The Heart Part 5,&#x201D; which is likely one of the tracks from his forthcoming album, <em>Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers</em>, out May 13.
</p><p>The song was produced by Beach Noise, the production and songwriting trio of Matt Schaeffer, Johnny Kosich, and Jake Kosich, whose other production credits include multiple tracks by Baby Keem. &#x201C;The Heart Part 5&#x201D; also includes instrumental contributions from Kyle Miller and Bekon.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAPUkgeiFVY?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uAPUkgeiFVY?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>On the track, Lamar showcases his signature rapid-fire flow, and the lyrical assassin drops some memorable bars. &#x201C;I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor/&#xA0;Rebellious and Margielas&#x2019;ll chip you for designer/&#xA0;Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence/&#xA0;Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment,&#x201D; he raps.
</p><p>Lamar announced the <em>DAMN.</em> followup last month, when he <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/kendricklamar/status/1516114615477825537" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a></strong> a new link to his &#x201C;Oklama&#x201D; website. The webpage contained a folder which provided <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/kendrick-lamar-new-album-mr-morale-and-the-big-steppers/">the release date and title</a></strong> of his new album.
</p><p>The official document on the website says, &#x201C;The following statement was released today&#xA0;by oklama, through his company pgLang at 11:00am PT in Los Angeles, CA: Album: &#x201C;Mr. Morale &amp; The Big Steppers,&#x201D; Release date: 5/13/2022, All factual information for this release will come directly from this source only.&#x201D;
</p><p>In August of 2021, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/kendrick-lamar-new-album-oklama/">Lamar first debuted the &#x201C;Oklama&#x201D; website</a></strong>.&#xA0;Kendrick initially confirmed that <em>Oklama</em> would be&#xA0;the title of his new album, although now it&#x2019;s set to be <em>Mr. Morale &amp; the Big Steppers</em>.
</p><p>The minimal, bare-bones website initially only featured a folder titled &#x201C;nu thoughts,&#x201D; which revealed a written statement from the MC announcing his next studio album, signed as &#x201C;oklama.&#x201D; Among other revelations, Lamar also referred to it as his &#x201C;final TDE album,&#x201D; shouting out his fruitful partnership with LA-based <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/kendrick-lamar-black-panther-album/">Top Dawg Entertainment</a></strong>.
</p><p>Lamar, who has been mum about any new projects since <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/kendrick-lamar-damn-album/"><em><strong>DAMN</strong>.</em></a> was released in 2017, has kept fans guessing with mercurial statements and a few appearances scattered throughout his half-decade sabbatical.
</p><p>In response to Lamar&#x2019;s note, Anthony &#x201C;Top Dawg&#x201D; Tiffith, CEO and founder of Top Dawg Entertainment, wrote, &#x201C;With this being Dot&#x2019;s last album on TDE, this is more of a VICTORY LAP, a celebration. I know he will be successful in whatever it is he decides to do and will have our FULL support.&#x201D;

<p>His distinctive style as a recording artist has attracted a cult following, and last year he released <em>Mixing Colours</em>, his first duo album with brother <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/brian-eno/"><strong>Brian Eno</strong></a>, which gained <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/roger-brian-eno-mixing-colours-expanded/"><strong>widespread critical acclaim</strong></a>.

<p>Alongside his brother, Roger has contributed to scores for major films, including David Lynch&#x2019;s Dune, Dario Argento&#x2019;s Opera and Adrian Lyne&#x2019;s <em>9&#xBD; Weeks</em>. Their score for Danny Boyle&#x2019;s BBC mini-series <em>Mr. Wroe&#x2019;s Virgins</em> was nominated for a BAFTA. As a solo composer, Roger scored Trevor Nunn&#x2019;s highly acclaimed production of Harold Pinter&#x2019;s <em>Betrayal</em> at London&#x2019;s National Theatre. and Nick Hornby&#x2019;s celebrated TV series <em>State of the Union</em>.
</p><p>Roger Eno was born in the Suffolk market town of Woodbridge. He became immersed in music at school and bought a battered upright piano with money earned every Saturday as a butcher&#x2019;s boy. His musical education continued at Colchester Institute School of Music. After a brief interlude playing jazz piano in private clubs in London, he returned to East Anglia.
</p><p>For many years Roger has lived in a small town on the border of Suffolk and Norfolk. Those two rural counties, with their quiet lanes, medieval churches, and waterways, have given focus and intensity to the natural introspection of his music. He has described his creative process as one of &#x201C;decomposing&#x201D;, of finding and sleeping on an idea, waking early the next morning and stripping away all excess from it to reveal its essence.

														<p>Bono and The Edge of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/u2/"><strong>U2</strong></a> gave a surprise performance in a metro station now being used as a bomb shelter in Kyiv, Ukraine, yesterday (8). The gesture follows a personal invitation by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
</p><p>A social media post by U2 at lunchtime in the UK yesterday read: &#x201C;President @ZelenskyyUa invited us to perform in Kyiv as a show of solidarity with the Ukrainian people and so that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ve come to do. &#x2014; Bono and The Edge #StandWithUkraine.&#x201D; In April, they took part in Global Citizen&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/u2-billie-eilish-appear-in-stand-up-for-ukraine-livestream/"><strong>#StandUpForUkraine</strong></a> social media rally, performing an acoustic &#x201C;Walk On.&#x201D;</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9cyq5VDQbw?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9cyq5VDQbw?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>Accompanied by The Edge on acoustic guitar, Bono sang U2 hits such as &#x201C;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&#x201D; &#x201C;Vertigo,&#x201D; &#x201C;Desire,&#x201D; &#x201C;Angel of Harlem,&#x201D; &#x201C;With or Without You,&#x201D; &#x201C;Pride (In The Name Of Love),&#x201D; &#x201C;Walk On,&#x201D; and &#x201C;One.&#x201D; They also included a version of Ben E. King&#x2019;s soulful perennial &#x201C;Stand By Me.&#x201D;
</p><p>A crowd of approximately 100 people were present at the event, with the stars joined by Ukrainian soldiers and members of the Ukrainian band Antytila. Bono said: &#x201C;Your president leads the world in the cause of freedom right now. The people of Ukraine are not just fighting for your own freedom, you&#x2019;re fighting for all of us who love freedom. We pray that you will enjoy some of that peace soon.&#x201D;
</p><p>Zelenskyy said in his daily video address that he was &#x201C;grateful&#x201D; to the band &#x201C;for supporting our people and drawing even more attention to the need to help our people.&#x201D;
</p><p>During their visit to the war-torn country, Bono and The Edge also paid a visit to Bucha, the city in which hundreds of bodies were found in a mass grave in March. The Free Ukraine account posted: &#x201C;Bono has been involved in charitable activities in different parts of the world for decades, today he saw with his own eyes the consequences of the Russian invasion for Bucha.&#x201D;

														<p>Mabel has joined the line-up for this year&#x2019;s LooseFest. The 26-year-old singer &#x2013; whose hits include &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Call Me Up&#x201D; and &#x201C;Boyfriend&#x201D; &#x2013; will perform at the music festival <a href="https://www.festicket.com/festivals/loosefest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, England, on July 31</strong></a>.
</p><p>Dean Saunders, who is one of the founding members of LooseFest, said: &#x201C;We are delighted to add Mabel to our LooseFest 2022 line up! We absolutely love her new track &#x201C;Good Luck&#x201D; and we can&#x2019;t wait for her to join us, on what is quickly becoming one of the most anticipated weekends of the year this summer!&#x201D;</p>
<p>Mabel released her debut album, <em>High Expectations</em>, in 2019 and has already surpassed 4.5 billion streams during her career.
</p><p>The chart-topping star will be joined at the festival by the likes of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/black-eyed-peas/"><strong>The Black Eyed Peas</strong></a>, AJ Tracey, Clean Bandit, Example, Hybrid Minds, Jamie Jones, Joel Corry, and Roger Sanchez.
</p><p>LooseFest is being billed as the largest music festival ever to take place in Newcastle, and the exciting event will feature multiple all-weather stages, as well as a ferris wheel and a street food village.
</p><p>Mabel previously revealed she&#x2019;s determined to have fun during her stage shows. The singer doesn&#x2019;t worry too much about the finer details of her shows and is instead focused on entertaining her fans.
</p><p>She said: &#x201C;It isn&#x2019;t about hitting all the notes or having a perfect stage show, it&#x2019;s about letting go and enjoying it.&#x201D;
</p><p>Mabel is also open and honest about her ambitions in the music business. The singer &#x2013; who is the daughter of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/neneh-cherry/"><strong>Neneh Cherry</strong></a> and Cameron McVey &#x2013; admits she wants to &#x201C;sell loads of records&#x201D; during her career.
</p><p>She said: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not embarrassed to say that I want to be really successful and I want to sell loads of records.&#x201D;
</p><p>Last Month, the British-Swedish singer and songwriter teamed up with powerhouse DJs and producers Jax Jones and Galantis for &#x201C;Good Luck,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/mabel-jax-jones-galantis-good-luck-single/"><strong>a blazing, upbeat track about clearing mental clutter</strong></a>.
</p><p>Speaking of the song, Mabel described &#x201C;Good Luck&#x201D; as &#x201C;the empowering song you need when getting ready to go out: when you&#x2019;re feeling low about someone, and your friends will take you out to get that person off your mind.&#x201D;

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
														<p>A trailer for the new docuseries <em>Dear Mama</em>, which centers around 2Pac (<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/tupac-shakur-wake-me-when-im-free-exhibit/"><strong>Tupac Shakur</strong></a>) and his mother Afeni, has been released by FX. You can check it out below.
</p><p>The brief teaser for the five-part <em>Dear Mama</em> was released to coincide with Mother&#x2019;s Day in the US. It shows images of Shakur, with a voiceover from Afeni describing a lesson she taught her son.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was my responsibility to teach 2Pac how to survive his reality,&#x201D; Afeni Shakur says in the clip. &#x201C;So, 2Pac do something wrong, take your little sorry self in that corner, get the New York Times and let&#x2019;s have a debate about it. Not a discussion, a debate. Let me hear what your idea is, stand up, defend it.&#x201D;
</p><p><em>Dear Mama</em> is named after the 1995 2Pac track, which is a tribute to Afeni and the love and respect that the rapper held for his mother. The docuseries is directed by Allen Hughes and &#x201C;told through the eyes of the people who knew them best&#x201D;.

<p>Hughes was behind the July 2017 HBO documentary <em>The Defiant Ones</em>, which focused on the creative and business partnership between <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/dr-dre/"><strong>Dr. Dre</strong></a> and Jimmy Iovine.
</p><p>The 2Pac docuseries was initially teased in 2019, when Hughes was given the blessing of the late rapper&#x2019;s estate.
</p><p>Shakur was killed in a drive-by shooting in September 1996 at the age of 25. After his death, Afeni created the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts in Georgia in his honor. She passed away in 2016 at the age of 69.
</p><p>Recently, a biopic on the life of Afeni Shakur called <em>Peace, Love &amp; Respect; the Afeni Shakur/Panther 21 Story</em> was also announced. The new biopic will follow a crucial two years in her life between 1969 and 1971, and her involvement in the Black Panther Party.
</p><p>The new biopic is set to be executive produced by Jasmine Guy and Jamal Joseph, while Dina LaPolt is producing. The film has also received the backing of the Shakur estate.

														<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/kanye-west/">Ye (Kanye West)</a></strong> has released a music video for the Andr&#xE9; 3000-assisted <em>DONDA</em> track &#x201C;Life of the Party.&#x201D;
</p><p>The new video includes deepfake performances from photos of West&#x2019;s childhood, and it arrives alongside the rapper&#x2019;s Balenciaga-engineered Yeezy Gap collection. Those items will be available for purchase on May 25. Portions of West&#x2019;s video also appeared in a TV commercial for the launch. The video does not include Andr&#xE9; 3000&#x2019;s verse.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/401hZy6Hipw?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/401hZy6Hipw?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>Back in March, West released a music video for another <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/donda-deluxe-edition-andre-3000/"><em>DONDA</em></a></strong> track, &#x201C;Hurricane.&#x201D; In the video, an animated group of prisoners break free from a prison before a character based on Kanye rises from the waters and inspires his followers to follow him and soar into the sky.
</p><p>The &#x201C;Life of the Party&#x201D; video is a shift in aesthetic direction for West, who released a number of other <em>DONDA</em> videos in a unified theme. &#x201C;Heaven and Hell,&#x201D; much like &#x201C;Hurricane,&#x201D; follows figures dressed all in black with their faces covered by black material as they move around a shadowy and gloomy urban environment. Later, a figure presumed to be West appears in the middle of a swirling mass of bodies, which go on to form a slow-moving tornado high above the clouds.
</p><p>The visuals end with still pictures of what appear to be battle scenes in apocalyptic landscapes. The Yeezy Gap logo is also superimposed over the last few images, highlighting the rapper&#x2019;s new collaboration between his Yeezy clothing brand, high street chain Gap, and fashion house Balenciaga, much like the video for &#x201C;Life of the Party.&#x201D;
</p><p>Recently, West was the subject of the critically acclaimed documentary trilogy <strong><em><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/jeen-yuhs-documentary-interview-netflix-playlist/">jeen-yuhs</a>,&#xA0;</em></strong>directed by Coodie &amp; Chike, who previously worked with West on the music videos for 2003&#x2019;s &#x201C;Through The Wire,&#x201D; and the third version of &#x201C;Jesus Walks.&#x201D;&#xA0;The duo followed West over the course of 21 years, and the doc shows the megastar in his early days, trying to break through in the music scene, and later, once he had established himself as a hip-hop icon.
