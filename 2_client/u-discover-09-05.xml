        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
														<p>Masked alternative artist BoyWithUke has released his debut album <em>Serotonin Dreams</em>, available now via Republic Records. The record arrives alongside a conclusive music video for the viral musician&#x2019;s latest single &#x201C;Understand.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;The album is my magnum opus. All produced on my iPad. It completes the &#x2018;Dreams&#x2019; saga. I&#x2019;m waking up,&#x201D; BoyWithUke shared in a statement. &#x201C;&#x2018;Understand&#x2019; is the highlight of the album. I had a lot of fun writing it. Very important lines in this one.&#x201D;</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2fjQrsKbAM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2fjQrsKbAM?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>The visual for &#x201C;Understand&#x201D; flashes back to 2012 where a young boy unboxes a mysterious package containing a ukulele. The instrument then acts as a window to the changing world around him. When he comes face to face with BoyWithUke, the musician removes his mask, offering up to the young boy instead.
</p><p>&#x201C;Girl, I hope you understand, I wanted to hold your hand / But I can&#x2019;t, wanted to be your man back then,&#x201D; he sings on the final chorus. &#x201C;And too bad I know I can&#x2019;t wake up because I lost my way / And you don&#x2019;t give a fuck about me, this could be a dream / I can&#x2019;t see the things that you see.&#x201D;
</p><p>In the comment section for the video, BoyWithUke revealed that he appears at some point in the video without his mask on &#x2013; though he insists it isn&#x2019;t where most viewers would expect.
</p><p>&#x201C;Growing up, I was in a very judgmental environment and I was bullied for my voice,&#x201D; BoyWithUke told <em>Billboard</em> earlier this year. &#x201C;I was afraid of how people would view me if they knew it was me singing. Having the mask, it allows me to be myself without fear of judgment from others. And I want people to really pay attention to the music, rather than what I look like.&#x201D;
</p><p><em>Serotonin Dreams</em> features collaborations with blackbear (&#x201C;<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/boywithuke-idgaf-blackbear-music-video/"><strong>IDGAF</strong></a>&#x201D;), mxmtoon (&#x201C;Prairies&#x201D;), and Powfu (&#x201C;Contigo&#x201D;).

														<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/westside-boogie-shelley-fka-dram-aight/">Wetstside Boogie&#x2019;s</a></strong> hot streak continues with his new single, &#x201C;Stuck,&#x201D; out now via Shady Records/Interscope Records.
</p><p>With emotional strings, somber piano chords, and G-funk-inspired synths, &#x201C;Stuck&#x201D; provides a rich, multi-layered soundtrack for the California rapper&#x2019;s contemplative bars. The track&#x2019;s unfiltered, reflective tone is perfectly captured by the Khufu-directed visual. Boogie also recently shared a moving performance of the song introducing all of his alter egos (Anthony, RatchetBoog &amp; Superblood Boog) through COLORS.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k3--5vljPE?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k3--5vljPE?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>On &#x201C;Stuck,&#x201D; Boogie documents daily life in Compton, his drive for rap domination, and the hold his neighborhood still has on him. &#x201C;Tell my momma that I love her, I don&#x2019;t do that s__t enough,&#x201D; he spits. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a bro bro and a cutta, I love the hood &#x2014; you know I&#x2019;m stuck.&#x201D; The confessional track finds Boogie torn between two worlds as he tries to reconcile his past with his bright future. It&#x2019;s the kind of raw, unflinchingly honest rap that Boogie does best. The MC&#x2019;s internal conflict is expertly conveyed in the powerful video.
</p><p>&#x201C;Stuck&#x201D; follows the blistering &#x201C;Aight&#x201D; as the second cut from the rap heavyweight&#x2019;s hotly anticipated sophomore album <em>More Black Superheroes</em>. Boogie&#x2019;s new era comes after a brief hiatus that stretches back to 2020&#x2019;s &#x201C;Outside.&#x201D; That song, which features Pro Era general Joey Bada$$, paid subtle homage to Eminem&#x2019;s 2000 classic &#x201C;The Way I Am&#x201D; while unloading a barrage of jabs at foes, and declaring Boogie&#x2019;s status as one of the greatest rappers going.
</p><p>With &#x201C;Stuck,&#x201D; Boogie shows off even more dimensions to his skills, turning in a razor-sharp anthem that showcases the pain that follows him, even when he&#x2019;s topping the charts.
</p><p>Few hip-hop artists command a space as purposefully anomalous as Long Beach-born, Compton-bred Anthony Dixson, whose stage name, Boogie, foreshadows his intrinsic talent for writing music that is rooted in realities that are simultaneously melancholy and joyfully uplifting. Oscillating between a soundscape underpinned by ardent praise rhythms and the gritty memories of a youth spent immersed in gangbanging, Boogie&#x2019;s brand of rap is as much a credo of the streets as it is a constant reflection on purpose and growth.

														<p>Indie rocker <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/s-g-goodman-all-my-love-is-coming-back-to-me-teeth-marks/">S.G. Goodman</a></strong> is back with a new single &#x201C;Heart Swell,&#x201D; an ethereal indie rock ballad about the inescapable, physical pain of heartbreak.
</p><p>Released alongside a live performance video filmed in Atlanta, GA, the single is from her highly anticipated new album <em>Teeth Marks</em>, set for release June 3 via Verve Forecast.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9sgyjESSBw?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u9sgyjESSBw?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>Goodman states of this song &#x201C;I wrote this song on my back porch in Kentucky and was reminded of how intense the cicadas had been in 2015, when  I just so happened to be going through a break&#x2013;up. The intensity of the cicada calls was what I felt like on the inside. Heartache was buzzing, it was constant, and there was no escaping it.&#x201D;
</p><p><em>Consequence</em>, who premiered the track, said &#x201C;&#x2018;Heart Swell&#x2019; showcases her distinct, conversational vocal style and intimate lyrics, one piece of what promises to be another rich tableau from the artist.&#x201D;
</p><p>On &#x201C;Heart Swell,&#x201D; Goodman uses a roomy call-and-response that was inspired in part by her upbringing in the church and choir. Goodman also plays drums on the track&#x2014;a first for her. An intimate live performance video of the single was also released, filmed at the famed Factor&#x2019;s tailoring studio in Atlanta and featuring guitarist Michael Ruth and singer Jordan Reynolds.
</p><p>Mining garage rock, Appalachian folk and post-punk influence, Goodman&#x2019;s sophomore album <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sg-goodman-teeth-marks/"><em>Teeth Marks</em></a></strong> finds her stirring vocals and emotionally astute songwriting draped in a sonic patchwork of southern indie rock. Currently on tour with Son Volt, Goodman will continue touring across the US, opening for Jason Isbell and more, plus headline dates including June 7 at New York&#x2019;s Mercury Lounge. She is also performing at KCRW&#x2019;s School Night on May 24 at The Sun Rose in Los Angeles, CA.
</p><p>Raised in Western Kentucky on the Mississippi River Delta in a strict church going family, Goodman went from singing in church three times a week to a prominent, politically active member of the Murray, KY indie rock scene.

														<p>Acclaimed L.A.-based dance producer <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/onerepublic-gryffin-you-were-loved/">Gryffin</a></strong> is back with a new single &#x201C;Alive,&#x201D; a soaring collaboration with Swedish singer/songwriter Calle Lehmann.
</p><p>Released via Darkroom/Interscope Records and accompanied by a lyric video, &#x201C;Alive&#x201D; showcases the powerful creative chemistry that Gryffin and Calle have previously brought to smash singles like the RIAA gold certified &#x201C;All You Need to Know&#x201D; with SLANDER. Earlier this week, Gryffin officially announced &#x201C;Alive&#x201D; as the title track for his highly anticipated forthcoming album nearly three years after his smash 2019 debut <em>Gravity</em>.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRKFeXJnWtI?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YRKFeXJnWtI?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m so proud to release the title track to my sophomore album, <em>Alive</em>. It&#x2019;s always a fun experience working with my longtime collaborator Calle Lehmann, and we&#x2019;re particularly excited to put this one out,&#x201D; says Gryffin of the track. &#x201C;&#x2018;Alive&#x2019; is an emotional record at its core, but has a euphoric dance beat driving it that feels like pure summer to us. We&#x2019;re thrilled to have it out and hope you enjoy it as much as we do.&#x201D;
</p><p>Not only a testament to Gryffin&#x2019;s masterful use of dynamics, &#x201C;Alive&#x201D; once again proves Gryffin and Calle&#x2019;s shared gift for transforming heartache into pure euphoria. Along with &#x201C;All You Need to Know&#x201D; &#x2014; a 2019 release that marked the first single from Gryffin&#x2019;s chart-topping debut album <em>Gravity</em> &#x2014; their past work includes 2021&#x2019;s &#x201C;After You,&#x201D; a collaboration between Gryffin and Jason Ross praised by outlets like <em>EDM.com</em>.
</p><p>&#x201C;Alive&#x201D; premieres as Gryffin moves forward with his nonstop run of live shows and festival dates. Known for his explosive and emotionally charged live set, the multi-instrumentalist will take the stage next month at Bonnaroo, in addition to continuing his successful Las Vegas residency at The Wynn&#x2019;s Encore Beach Club and XS Nightclub. On Friday, October 21, he&#x2019;ll also return to Red Rocks Amphitheatre to headline the legendary venue for the very first time.

														<p>The <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/peter-gregson-moby-extreme-ways-remix/"><strong>latest release</strong></a> from Moby&#x2019;s forthcoming <em>Reprise &#x2013; Remixes</em> album, scheduled for release on May 20 via Deutsche Grammophon, comes from the British-born, Berlin-based musician planningtorock. The singer-songwriter, composer, producer, and director reimagined the acclaimed artists&#x2019; take on <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/david-bowie/"><strong>David Bowie&#x2019;</strong></a>s classic single &#x201C;Heroes.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;I really liked the gently paced cover version of &#x201C;Heroes&#x201D; Moby made, especially the soft, calm vocals by Mindy Jones,&#x201D; planningtorock shared in a statement. &#x201C;For this remix I wanted to take those beautiful vocals and make them even more serene and stately by pitching them down just a little.&#x201D;</p>
<p>They added: &#x201C;Then I wanted to contrast that serene energy with a driven, trance-like club track that would embody both my northern English musical roots and my 20 years of living and producing music in Berlin.&#x201D;
<!-- Video ID H2tTDw1r5QY restricted in US or is no longer live -->
</p><p>The release arrives alongside a moving music video directed by David S&#xE1;nchez Valenciaga. The visual stars activist Natalia Lane as she campaigns for the rights of trans people and sex workers in Mexico.
</p><p>Moby&#x2019;s rendition of &#x201C;Heroes&#x201D; originally appeared on his orchestral album <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/moby-reprise/"><em>Reprise</em></a></strong>, released in 2021.

<p>&#x201C;Even after all this time, I&#x2019;m still humbled and amazed that I got to be friends and neighbors with David Bowie,&#x201D; Moby shared in a statement last year. &#x201C;The greatest and most inspiring musician of all time.&#x201D;
</p><p>The musician shared a brief video discussing his friendship with Bowie and the inception of his &#x201C;Heroes&#x201D; cover on Reprise. Recalling a moment where he performed the song on acoustic guitar at his home alongside the late icon, he explains: &#x201C;We sat on the sofa in my living room with the sun coming through the window and the sun coming through the windows. Just the two of us there, we played a very simple, vulnerable version of Heroes.&#x201D; And it stands as one of not just the greatest moments of my musical moments, but one of the greatest moments of my life &#x2013; of my spiritual life, my professional life, my creative life.&#x201D;

														<p>DNCE has made its return with an irresistible new single, titled &#x201C;Move&#x201D; &#x2013;&#xA0;the band&#x2019;s first piece of new material in four years.
</p><p>Led by <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/joe-jonas-devotion-film/">Joe Jonas</a></strong>, the group recently hinted a comeback was on the cards when it made an appearance on <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/kygo-zoe-wees-love-me-now/">Kygo</a></strong>&#x2019;s boisterous banger &#x201C;Dancing Feet.&#x201D; It has already helped propel that track to over 38 million Spotify streams and over 6 million YouTube views of the music video.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<em>All I&#x2019;m trying to do is make you get up out that chair and make you move</em>,&#x201D; Jonas sings in a fiery falsetto on the funky new single, which boasts slippery seventies-style guitars, head-nodding bassline, and swaggering beat. &#x201C;<em>Grab that drink and meet me on the dancefloor baby, let&#x2019;s get crazy, move</em>.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;&#x2018;Move&#x2019; is the song that convinced me DNCE had more music to release into the world,&#x201D; says Jonas said of the track. &#x201C;I wrote it with my friend Ryan Tedder just for fun and immediately knew it was something special and needed the DNCE treatment! We can&#x2019;t wait for everyone to hear it and perform it live.&#x201D;

<p>According to a press release, &#x201C;Move&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t the only thing to expect from the band in 2022, with more promised soon.
</p><p>DNCE makes its return to pick up where it left off, as a critically and commercially successful act that dominated both radio airwaves and streaming stats alike. Its RIAA quintuple-platinum certified single &#x201C;Cake By The Ocean&#x201D; instantly permeated pop culture upon its release in 2016, ending the year as one of the most played songs on Top 40 radio.
</p><p>In its first stint, the band &#x2013;&#xA0;completed by drummer Jack Lawless and guitarist JinJoo Lee &#x2013; also earned 3.2 billion global streams with its self-titled debut album and nods at the 2016 MTV European Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards.

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
														<p>Mickey Gilley, the prolific country hitmaker and actor closely associated with the rise of the urban cowboy movement, died yesterday (7) in Branson, Missouri. He was 86 and had recently returned from his latest tour dates, a ten-show run in April, before his health failed in the last week. He passed away peacefully with family and close friends by his side. Last night&#x2019;s show at Nashville&#x2019;s Grand Ole Opry included recognition of the news.
</p><p>Gilley&#x2019;s contemporary country star T.G. Sheppard wrote on social media: &#x201C;He truly altered the course of country music. I was fortunate to have gotten to see one of his last concerts 3 weeks ago. Prayers for Cindy, family and his fans.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Gilley was born in Natchez, Mississippi on March 9, 1936 and was raised in Ferriday, Louisiana. His cousins were rock&#x2019;n&#x2019;roll original Jerry Lee Lewis and future evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, and he grew up alongside them playing boogie-woogie piano, working in construction but also playing in the nightclubs of Louisiana.
</p><p>His first country chart appearance, on the Paula label, was with the modest success &#x201C;Now I Can Live Again&#x201D; in 1968. It would be the first of 46 entries, but his popularity on record came in the wake of his 1971 opening, with co-owner Sherwood Cryer, of the nightclub Gilleys in Pasadena, Texas. It led to a chain of the venues.
</p><h2>&#x2018;A huge impact on my career&#x2019;</h2>
<p>With its famous mechanical bull, the club inspired the 1980 film <em>Urban Cowboy</em>, starring John Travolta and Debra Winger, after Aaron Latham wrote an article in <em>Esquire</em> about the relationship between two Gilleys regulars. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s impossible to tell you how grateful I am for my involvement with <em>Urban Cowboy</em>,&#x201D; Gilley said in 1982. &#x201C;That film had a huge impact on my career, and still does.&#x201D;
</p><p>The singer hit No.1 on the country bestsellers for the first time, on the Playboy label, in 1974 with &#x201C;Room Full Of Roses,&#x201D; a remake of Sammy Kaye&#x2019;s 1949 pop hit. He went on to achieve a remarkable 17 chart-toppers, including three more in a row with &#x201C;I Overlooked An Orchid,&#x201D; &#x201C;City Lights,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Window Up Above.&#x201D;
</p><p>From 1980, when <em>Urban Cowboy</em> took his profile to new levels, he scored six No.1s in a row and ten out of 11 releases, with covers of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/buddy-holly/"><strong>Buddy Holly</strong></a>&#x2019;s &#x201C;True Love Ways,&#x201D; Ben E. King&#x2019;s &#x201C;Stand By Me,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/ray-charles/"><strong>Ray Charles</strong></a>&#x2019; &#x201C;You Don&#x2019;t Know Me,&#x201D; Little Willie John&#x2019;s &#x201C;Talk To Me,&#x201D; and such originals as &#x201C;That&#x2019;s All That Matters&#x201D; and &#x201C;Fool For Your Love.&#x201D; The <em>Urban Cowboy</em> soundtrack reached No.3 on the <em>Billboard</em> album chart and contained six Top 40 hits.
</p><p>Gilley went on to star in hit TV shows including <em>Murder She Wrote, The Fall Guy, Fantasy Island, </em>and<em> The Dukes of Hazzard</em>. He won six Academy of Country Music Awards, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2011. His last Top 10 hit was with &#x201C;Doo-Wah Days&#x201D; in 1986 but he maintained a strong presence on the road, including at the Mickey Gilley Grand Shanghai Theatre in Branson, which he helped to run.

														<p>Beats by Dre (Beats) teams up with Grammy Award-winning artist <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/hot-97-summer-jam-lil-baby-pusha-t-city-girls/">Lil Baby</a></strong> and NBA All-Star Ja Morant in its latest campaign. The 90-second video will air in Game 3 of the NBA Playoffs, during which Morant will be playing.
</p><p>The campaign is centered around Lil Baby and Ja Morant&#x2019;s friendship and mutual admiration, which ultimately led to Lil Baby writing &#x201C;Dark Mode&#x201D; about the player. Both the track and the campaign play off Morant&#x2019;s ethos around basketball, which can be summed up with the phrase, &#x201C;welcome to the dark.&#x201D; While many want to bask in the spotlight, one&#x2019;s work ultimately illuminates itself as a result of relentlessly honing their craft in the darkness.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9N6qD-c4a4?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;span data-mce-type=&quot;bookmark&quot; style=&quot;display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;&quot; class=&quot;mce_SELRES_start&quot;&gt;&#xFEFF;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k9N6qD-c4a4?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">&#xFEFF;</span></iframe></div>
<p>Lil Baby&#x2019;s track focuses on &#x201C;going into dark mode,&#x201D; a behavior which has ultimately made Morant one of the most exciting players to watch in the league. The spot also visually reflects darkness, with both superstars appearing solely in monochromatic black and white throughout the entirety of the video.
</p><p>&#x201C;Ja has been one of my favorite players to watch. We&#x2019;ve been locked in,&#x201D; said Lil Baby. &#x201C;This is not my first time partnering with Beats, but we took it up a notch with this original song. The world gets to experience &#x2018;Dark Mode&#x2019; for the first time in a way that&#x2019;s crazy!&#x201D;
</p><p>Beats first partnered with Lil Baby on its 2020 award-winning campaign titled &#x201C;You Love Me,&#x201D; while Ja Morant was recently signed as an ambassador to the brand. In the new spot, Lil Baby sports Beats Studio Buds in Moon Gray and Morant wears Beats Studio Buds in Sunset Pink, available exclusively at Target.
</p><p>Lil Baby recently dropped <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/lil-baby-frozen/">&#x201C;Frozen,&#x201D;</a> </strong>which was preceded by singles&#xA0;&#x201C;Right On&#x201D; and &#x201C;In A Minute,&#x201D; both of which crashed into the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.
</p><p>April was a busy month for the acclaimed rapper. As well as dishing out a bevvy of tracks, the star lit up Coachella&#x2019;s main stage across the festival&#x2019;s two weekends with a fiery performance and was <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/olivia-rodrigo-winners-2022-grammy-awards/">triumphant at the 2022 Grammys</a></strong> in Las Vegas. Lil Baby picked up a trophy for Best Melodic Rap Performance for his powerful verse on &#x201C;Hurricane&#x201D; with <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/kanye-west/">Kanye West</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-weeknd/">The Weeknd</a></strong>.

														<p>Burgeoning star <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/stunna-4-vegas-the-one/">Stunna 4 Vegas</a></strong> continues his scorching run with the Icewear Vezzo-assisted &#x201C;BMF.&#x201D; After releasing a string of hearty tracks, Stunna taps his one-time production partner D.A. Got That Dope for the tuneful new track. The record is an incendiary effort by Stunna and Vezzo, who throw a barrage of punchlines to stun the competition.
</p><p>Along with releasing his new song, Stunna announced his new album <em>Rae Rae&#x2019;s Son</em>, which is slated to drop soon. This year, Stunna kept fans enthralled with his fiery streak, releasing songs like &#x201C;Pay Me To Speak,&#x201D; &#x201C;The One,&#x201D; and D.A. Got That Dope-produced track &#x201C;Suspect.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Stunna announced his new tour. Titled Rae Rae&#x2019;s Son Tour, Stunna will partake in a multi-city jaunt beginning this May and land in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, and Dallas before his June 11 finale in Denver. YRB Teez and SSG Splurge will accompany the Billion Dollar Baby star on his trek.
</p><p>Since he joined Billion Dollar Baby and Interscope in 2019, Stunna 4 Vegas has emerged into one of the roster&#x2019;s most promising talents, with over 816 million streams in the U.S. alone. His frenetic energy and ear for top-tier street anthems launched the run of success that began with his <em>Big 4X</em> mixtape release that cracked the top 50 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.
</p><p>He built on that initial success with the January 2020 release of his debut album, <em>Rich Youngin</em>, which shot into the top 30 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and the top 20 of the Rap Albums list on the heels of hits such as &#x201C;DO DAT&#x201D; featuring DaBaby and Lil Baby and &#x201C;Up the Smoke&#x201D; with Offset. Stunna 4 Vegas kept grinding with a heavy touring lineup in 2021, including featured performer slots at Rolling Loud, Made in America, and OVO Fest, as well as headlining his own national tour.
