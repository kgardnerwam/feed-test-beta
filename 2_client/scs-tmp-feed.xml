        <![CDATA[ <section class="article-content "> <p class="speakable-content">If anyone was expecting the NBA&#x2019;s trade market to be action-packed, they&#x2019;ve certainly been let down thus far, as none of the bigger names that are reportedly available have been moved. The <a href="https://spacecityscoop.com/">Houston Rockets</a> have two of the most high-profile names that are expected to be moved in <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/o/oladivi01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" ref="nofollow">Victor Oladipo</a> and <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/tuckepj01.html?utm_campaign=Linker&amp;utm_source=direct&amp;utm_medium=linker-" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" ref="nofollow">P.J. Tucker</a>, who are both on expiring deals and have each rejected the Rockets&#x2019; offer for a contract extension.</p><p class="speakable-content">The rumors surrounding both players have been heating up, as the latest news on Tucker is that 70 percent of the league is interested in him. In Oladipo&#x2019;s case, it&#x2019;s been reported that the Miami Heat and New York Knicks have the most interest, with most people believing that the Knicks will be most likely to make a trade offer, as the Heat don&#x2019;t present a compelling enough package, and especially without fan favorite Tyler Herro, who Miami wasn&#x2019;t willing to even include in the James Harden sweepstakes when the Houston Rockets were shopping him.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Have the Knicks lost interest in Houston Rockets guard Victor Oladipo?</h2><p>But the latest chatter regarding the Knicks&#x2019; interest in Oladipo doesn&#x2019;t seem nearly as positive as the initial reports. ESPN&#x2019;s Zach Lowe <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kirk-goldsberry-on-the-growing-imbalance-in-the-nba/id986595124?i=1000513228943" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently discussed the state of affairs</a> on <em>The Lowe Post</em>.</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;m just not sure, if I&#x2019;m one of the teams that have been rumored. I know the teams that have been linked, I wrote this about the Knicks before the season.</p><p>They were taking a we&#x2019;ve gotta wait and see with Victor, after the injury and the very short season last season.</p><p>I&#x2019;m not sure anything they&#x2019;ve waited and seen would convince me that I need to go get Victor Oladipo right now for the stretch run. So I&#x2019;m not sure where Houston is going to find a deal there but my guess is that they will look.&#x201D;</p></blockquote><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="{&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;light&quot;}" data-text="Why Oladipo could be stuck with the Rockets" data-url="https://spacecityscoop.com/2021/03/16/houston-rockets-rumor-victor-oladipo-not-traded/" data-call-to-action="Related Story"> <div class="story-link-related"> <a class="story-link-related-btn" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-related-shortcode" href="https://spacecityscoop.com/2021/03/16/houston-rockets-rumor-victor-oladipo-not-traded/"> <span class="call_to_action">Related Story:</span> Why Oladipo could be stuck with the Rockets </a> </div></div><p>On Tuesday, Sirius XM&#x2019;s Justin Termine spoke on the possibility of the Knicks making a move for Oladipo on <em>Give and Go</em>, and Termine echoed the sentiments of Lowe.</p><blockquote><p>&#x201C;I just hope they don&#x2019;t make a mistake and go and get Victor Oladipo. My God.</p><p>Whether it&#x2019;s New York or Miami, I mean can you make a bigger mistake than Victor Oladipo?&#x201D;</p></blockquote><p>For what it&#x2019;s worth, Oladipo has played well of late, which figures to be his best chance of raising his value between now and the March 25th trade deadline.</p><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">Victor Oladipo&#x2019;s last 4 games: </p><p>29.0 PPG<br>4.2 RPG<br>5.8 APG<br>43% FG <a href="https://t.co/UFurQXOHZ2">pic.twitter.com/UFurQXOHZ2</a></p><p>&#x2014; NBA Central (@TheNBACentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheNBACentral/status/1372012150739329031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><p>As if this wasn&#x2019;t impressive enough, Oladipo has also caught fire from long-range during that span, shooting 37.1 percent from deep (13-of-35). If the Knicks do have interest in adding the 28-year-old guard, they&#x2019;d be wise to make a trade for him now, because they don&#x2019;t have the luxury of waiting until his contract ends to make a move for him, as the Miami Heat would seem to have the upper hand on adding Oladipo in free agency, as that&#x2019;s where it&#x2019;s been reported that he has the most interest in playing.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="{&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;dark&quot;}" data-text="4 trades to send Aaron Gordon to the Rockets" data-url="https://spacecityscoop.com/2021/03/16/4-trades-to-send-aaron-gordon-to-houston-rockets/" data-call-to-action="Next"> <div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background: #CC0000" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://spacecityscoop.com/2021/03/16/4-trades-to-send-aaron-gordon-to-houston-rockets/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span> 4 trades to send Aaron Gordon to the Rockets </a> </div></div><p>For a team that has missed on several high-profile players of late, the Knicks&#x2019; best chance of rebuilding their brand while also improving their roster this season would be to make a move for Oladipo, and especially with his play of late.</p> </section> ]]>
