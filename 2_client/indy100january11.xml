Now it’s up to the Attorney General to see if he is going to do something.”</p><p>This claim by Trump has been refuted by a 93-page report by the Maricopa County Elections Department which identified misleading or false claims in the partisan audit of Trump’s “loss” <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/election-officials-rebut-claims-republican-led-arizona-review-trumps-2020-loss-2022-01-05/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported.</p><p>It showed that 22 claims that were misleading, 41 that included flawed or misstated analysis and 13 that were demonstrably false and found no evidence of double voting.</p><p>“We determined that nearly every finding included faulty analysis, inaccurate claims, misleading conclusions and a lack of understanding of federal and state election laws,” the report said.</p><p>Meanwhile, Trump also praised Bobb and OAN for their coverage of the “rigged” election, and told the host: “You cover this better than anybody, and you know what you do and what OAN does is so important.” </p><p>It should be noted that Bobb assisted in the campaign to get the 2020 election result overturned and was one of six people present at Trump’s “war room” at the Willard Hotel as they tried to prevent Biden’s win from being certified -

You must follow these rules even when they set a ‘higher bar’ than other external regulations unless you have specific approval to the contrary from a senior executive.</p><p>The Editorial provisions of the Code are applicable to all employees, workers, and contributors to the Group's publications, whether contracted or freelance or otherwise commissioned. While individuals take personal responsibility for their own compliance, managers should also ensure this Code is understood and complied with by employees, workers and contributors in their own areas. If managers believe that they or those working for them have insufficient knowledge about the legal and regulatory environment within which they work, they must contact the managing editor’s office.</p><p>In addition to this Code, you must adhere to the general law and any other external regulations as required by the Group - notably the Editors’ Code of Practice in respect of material published by indy100.com and including official social media channels.</p><p>Many staff will work primarily for one company within the Group. Managers should be aware, therefore, that individuals may require advice and guidance on regulatory questions if they are contributing to a platform that is outside their usual sphere of operations.</p><p>If you have any queries about relevant regulations or legal matters, please contact the managing editor or head of legal as appropriate.</p><p><strong>The public interest</strong></p><p>Breaking rules can sometimes be justified where there is a legitimate 'public interest' in publishing a story. This can include such things as detecting or exposing crime or impropriety, protecting the security of the general public and preventing people and communities from being misled by the behaviour of another individual or organisation. The public interest is not, of course, the same thing as ‘being interesting to the public’. Context is vital to making judgements about what might be in the public interest.</p><p>With regard to the law, it is no defence to certain criminal offences (e.g. phone-hacking) that any resulting story would be in the public interest. In other areas of the law (for instance the Data Protection Act), the public interest might be a factor but you should seek legal advice if you believe that your journalistic activity may result in a breach of any legislation.</p><p>If you believe that a story breaches this Code or industry best practice but has a public interest justification you should discuss the terms of that justification as precisely as possible with your line manager and, if necessary, with other senior editorial executives. If circumstances permit, it may be useful to take a brief note of such discussions, although the Group recognises that it will often not be feasible because of deadline and other time pressures. If in doubt, speak in the first instance to your line manager. If you are planning an undercover investigation (i.e. any investigation where you are deliberately hiding the fact that you are a journalist) you should always seek prior approval from the managing editor’s office, bearing in mind the information in this Code below.</p><p>PREPARING FOR PUBLICATION</p><p><strong>Pre-publication editorial and legal clearance</strong></p><p>You must fully cooperate with the editors in the area you are working in or for, and undertake whatever pre-publication checks and research are requested by those editors or by the companies’ legal advisers or other relevant executives.</p><p>Legal claims can be hugely expensive to the Group as well as damaging to its reputation. To be in the best position to defend a claim or complaint it is important that the people involved in preparation and publication of the story ensure that:</p><ul><li>their pre-publication conduct is beyond reproach;</li><li>they use their best efforts to get all the facts right;</li><li>they do the necessary research and;</li><li>they seek a response from the subject of an article if appropriate (which it usually will be). </li></ul><p>Always ask for advice about any specific issues you are not sure about. Also, be mindful of the need to remain up to date with all information provided on legal and compliance subjects, and make sure you familiarise yourself with legal bulletins and notices sent out by your department heads, by the companies’ head of legal, the managing editor’s office or by other senior executives.</p><p>It is your duty to raise, in a full and frank manner and making full disclosure, any issues that could have a bearing on whether publication of any material you are involved in complies with all legal and regulatory requirements as well as any issues to do with staff conduct.</p><p>If in doubt about regulatory matters please contact your line manager or the managing editor.</p><p><strong>Identifying yourself and dealing with the public</strong></p><p>In the course of your work you will speak to a great many people. Except in exceptional circumstances (see below), you should be up front about the fact you are a journalist and you must always identify who you are and who you work for when asked, unless there are public interest reasons for not doing so.</p><p>You must not intimidate or harass individuals nor engage in persistent physical pursuit. If you are asked to stop questioning, contacting, filming or photographing someone you must do so. Public interest exemptions can apply in this area but they are relatively rare. In the first instance you should consult your line manager if there is any complaint about your conduct (more information about what to do if someone makes a complaint is set out below).</p><p>The same rules apply when contacting somebody via email, Facebook or Twitter that apply in relation to face-to-face meetings and phone conversations: if someone says they don’t want to be contacted further, you should stop – whatever the platform you are communicating on.</p><p>In cases involving grief, you must conduct your enquiries with particular sympathy and discretion. If you plan to approach somebody who is in hospital (or any medical institution, including a care home) you are likely to require consent from the hospital’s authorities before doing so. You must not approach children at school without the consent of parents <em>and </em>the school authorities.</p><p><strong>Sources</strong></p><p>If an investigative story or any allegation of wrongdoing depends on the word of a single source you should try and get it corroborated by at least one other, unconnected and trustworthy source. In some circumstances you will need to formalise the evidence that you have obtained from a key source (eg by preparing a witness statement). You may in such cases need to speak to the Group’s head of legal.</p><p>If a source needs to remain confidential you should ensure that they cannot be identified – directly or indirectly - from your notes, or any data on your mobile phone or other device.</p><p><strong>Researching online</strong></p><p>You should be cautious how you use the internet or social media to obtain material for a story, both in terms of trustworthiness of the information or identification, and also the rights in the material (eg copyright).</p><p>From the point of view of rights ownership, you should bear in mind that what you see online, including on social media, is not free for use just because it is free to view. So, not only must you consider questions of accuracy and privacy, you should also assess whether material can lawfully be reproduced or even drawn on without the consent of the rights holder and whether re-use of that material may carry a fee. In any event, you must always attribute content as fully as possible so that readers know its origins.</p><p>Consider too whether material – especially from social media or from historic sources – might constitute a contempt of court in relation to current, ongoing legal proceedings.</p><p><strong>Dealings with children</strong></p><p>There is no blanket prohibition on journalists talking to children or on using what they say for publication. However, you must not – unless there is an <u>exceptional</u> public interest – speak to a child under 16 on any subject that touches on his/her, or another child’s, welfare (that is, probably any personal issue) without the consent of whoever has legal custody of the child. It is usually <u>not</u> adequate to rely on consent from a teacher, a non-custodial parent or other family member, e.g. grandparent.</p><p>If in doubt, ask a child how old they are and get confirmation if you are still unsure. The onus is on you to establish an accurate age.</p><p>If you have any uncertainty about the public interest requirements or any other matter, do talk to your department head and then, as appropriate, the managing editor’s office, the Group’s head of legal or another senior executive.</p><p><strong>Putting the story to the subject</strong></p><p>It is not only good, responsible journalism but also a keystone of how we might defend a libel complaint, that any potentially critical or damaging reference is put to the subject before publication. This ensures that the subject is given the opportunity to point out any errors in a story as well as to comment on it so that their response can be included in the article in the interests of fairness. The more serious the allegation, the more important it is to provide the subject with a proper opportunity to respond. You should consider whether it would be appropriate to email a request in which you set out each allegation and give the subject an adequate amount of time to respond (sometimes it may be useful to send a repeat request). Always try to be realistic in your requests: bearing in mind the possibility that different time-zones and weekend/evening availability may have an impact on a subject’s ability to respond. And make sure you are as specific as possible in the questions you ask.</p><p>Contributors, especially to broadcast material, should be informed of the wider context within which their comments will be placed and – where applicable – be told about who else may be contributing to the same programme or article.</p><p><strong>Note-taking and Record-keeping</strong></p><p>You should where possible make detailed notes or keep other contemporaneous records of pre-publication conversations or exchanges, and these should be retained, bearing in mind that you may have to produce them as evidence in court.</p><p>It is acceptable to audio-record key telephone conversations with people to whom you have identified yourself as a journalist provided you only use the recording as a background aid in place of or in addition to handwritten notes. If you intend to publish the recording you must make that clear at the outset and obtain consent (note: subterfuge, and its public interest justifications, is dealt with below).</p><p>If you have obtained material from the internet it is important that you retain copies of relevant pages, tweets, pictures or posts. Since information can easily be taken offline, you should take screen-grabs of any material that could be contentious or disputed.</p><p><strong>Use of freelance journalists and due diligence procedures</strong></p><p>When commissioning material from a freelance individual or entity, for example an outside investigative company, you should take steps to consider whether their track-record suggests they are professional, reliable and trustworthy.</p><p>If you are in any doubt, refer the issue to your department head. Any freelance you intend to use should be directed to this Code of Conduct and to the Terms for Freelance Contributions on the Group’s websites with which they are required to comply.</p><p><strong>Payments for information/sources</strong></p><p>We do not pay individuals or agencies for information about third parties that could breach their rights. However, there are exceptional circumstances when it could theoretically be acceptable: where the story would be in the public interest. If you are considering paying a source for such information you must fill in an Approval Form (see Appendix A), and submit it for approval to your line manager and the managing editor.</p><p>Parents should not be paid for information involving their child’s welfare, unless payment can be shown genuinely to be in the child’s interest.</p><p>In line with industry best practice there can be no payments or promises of payment to witnesses in criminal trials; there can be no payments to those who might reasonably be expected to be witnesses in future trials unless there is a public interest; and there can be no payments to convicted criminals or their associates for any material relating to their crime, unless there are exceptional circumstances (in which case you must discuss the case with your line manager and the managing editor).</p><p>Crucially, you must be aware that any payment to a police officer or public official will breach the law without exemption.</p><p><strong>Subterfuge and the use of improper or illegal journalistic methods</strong></p><p>No one should break the criminal law in their work for the Group.</p><p>Anyone engaging in any form of deception for journalistic purposes (and this includes where they do not make it clear they are a journalist when making enquiries) should seek approval in advance by completing an Approval Form (see Appendix B). It is important that this happens at an early stage in order that a proper record of the decision-making process is made which can be produced subsequently if necessary.</p><p>The form should be completed after discussion with your department head and the managing editor, if possible before you embark on any sort of undercover investigation, no matter how apparently insubstantial. Failure to get advance approval could lead to non-compliance with the company’s Code or a tainting of crucial legal evidence.</p><p>If you genuinely did not have an opportunity to seek approval in advance, or an external journalist or entity has come to us with evidence obtained through subterfuge, you must refer it urgently to your department head and the managing editor so that the situation can be properly assessed.</p><p><strong>*****************</strong></p><p><strong>Conflicts of Interest</strong></p><p>You should be transparent about any outside political, philosophical, religious or financial interests that might conflict with your journalistic independence or integrity, or could be perceived to do so. You should declare an interest before publication to your department head when you are involved with something with which you have a significant connection. The desk head should then decide whether a declaration should appear in any relevant article or broadcast, referring the matter to the managing editor as appropriate. For more information see the Conflicts of Interest Policy.</p><p><strong>Financial Reporting</strong></p><p>Even where the law may permit it, our journalists - whatever their status: employed, contracted, freelance or any other - should never use for their own profit financial information they receive in the course of their work before such information is published, nor should they pass such information to others. You must inform your department head of any significant interest in any shares or securities that you know you or your close family/ associates hold before writing or broadcasting about such shares or securities. You must not buy or sell, directly or through nominees or agents, shares or securities about which you have written recently or intend to write or which you have discussed in broadcast material.</p><p>If anyone writing about financial information is concerned about a potential conflict of interest, they must raise their concerns immediately with their department head. There are special rules for those working on business and city desks whereby journalists must ensure that an accurate and updated record is kept by their desk head or the managing editor of all relevant investments and interests.</p><p><strong>Confidentiality and other agreements</strong></p><p>If you are presented with a confidentiality agreement – a book or speech embargo for example – you must pass it to your desk head and, where appropriate, discuss the matter with the managing editor or the head of legal. Signature of such an agreement might bind not only your desk, but you and the company (or Group). You should not sign it or take on such a commitment without consulting whether that is in the Group's interests.</p><p>If you agree with a content provider that our use of a story, picture or video material should be restricted, either in terms of our initial publication or our syndication or exploitation of it, then you should inform the syndication department who will, in liaison with the head of legal and/or managing editor’s office, issue the appropriate restricted rights warning.</p><p>PUBLICATION</p><p><strong>Offensiveness</strong></p><p>We do not set out to offend the general reader or viewer and you should always consider how people will respond to our material. That is not to say that we should necessarily shy away from publication simply for fear that it might provoke a negative reaction in some quarters.</p><p><strong>Accuracy</strong><br/></p><p>It is our primary endeavour to publish information that is accurate and will not mislead readers. You must take care not to distort information either by disingenuous phrasing or by omission.</p><p>If you think that material has been published or broadcast that is wrong, you should notify your line manager and the managing editor’s office. It may be necessary to take corrective action but you should not generally proceed without discussion.</p><p><strong>Elections</strong> </p><p>Exit polls or partial results must not be published on the day of an election before polls have closed. Seek advice if you are not sure.</p><p><strong>Attribution</strong></p><p>All substantial material and quotes should be attributed correctly (ie. by author and/or by title of the publication), whatever the source of such material, including another media outlet, agency, writer or journalist. Sources should be identified unless their security or a prior agreement of confidentiality dictates otherwise. The principle is to be transparent. Images should, similarly, be appropriately captioned. If you have sourced comments from social media or other websites you should take care to ensure that you do not present the material as if it has been provided as part of an interview. And remember that there may be a cost attached to re-using material whether you attribute it properly or not.</p><p><strong>Quotes - direct and anonymous</strong></p><p>If quoting someone directly, you should generally use their exact words. If you do not want to use the way they have expressed something then, if it is editorially justified, you should not quote directly but paraphrase their words in indirect speech, taking care not to change the actual meaning.</p><p>You should exercise caution if you want to quote someone anonymously. Ask yourself what their motivation is if they are not prepared to go on the record, and whether an improper purpose could taint their reliability as a source (and thus make defending our published or broadcast material more difficult).</p><p><strong>Copy/picture approval</strong></p><p>In order to ensure the integrity and independence of our editorial content we should not offer copy or picture approval to any subject. If this is the only way to secure an interview, approval must be sought in advance from your desk head or relevant senior executives.</p><p><strong>Reporting suicide</strong></p><p>Evidence suggests that media reporting of suicide can influence others who are suicidal or mentally fragile to take their own lives. When reporting suicide you should avoid excessive detail about the method used: information that amounts to a step-by-step guide will be too much. Care should also be taken not to glamorise suicide or its victims; and not perpetually to repeat details of past suicides at a particular place.</p><p><strong>Victims of sexual assault</strong></p><p>When reporting on stories involving sexual assault, the utmost care should be taken to avoid identifying the victim. Legally, victims (and alleged victims) have a right to anonymity. However, this is not just a question of omitting an individual’s name; any identifying details should be avoided. Remember, a seemingly innocuous detail may be very revealing to members of a local community. You should also be aware of the possibility of jigsaw identification, where a combination of small details effectively identifies the victim. Remember, identifying a victim of a sex crime is itself a criminal offence.</p><p>On occasion, an individual may waive their right to anonymity, or the court may permit the identification of the victim. In such circumstances, you should obtain clear evidence that consent has been granted before proceeding with publication in order to remove any possibility of confusion. Waivers of anonymity by a victim must be in writing. If in doubt, seek advice from the managing editor or the head of legal.</p><p>Under no circumstances should a child victim of sexual assault or witness in a sex case be identified. Again, be wary of what details you include in the report; if the case involves incest, you can either identify the defendant but ensure that there is no suggestion of their relation to the victim, or report the incestuous nature of the crime, but ensure the defendant is not identified. You should be cognisant of how other media have reported the case to guard against accidental jigsaw identification.</p><p><strong>Discrimination</strong></p><p>Care should be taken not to discriminate against people on the basis of, for instance, their sexual orientation, religion or race (or by virtue of an illness or disability). This means avoiding pejorative references to those aspects of their lives; but it also means not referring to them at all unless relevant to story.</p><p><strong>Privacy – general provisions</strong></p><p>We should avoid intrusions into people's privacy: that is, reporting details about their personal lives unless there is a clear public interest in doing so. For example, you should take care if thinking about reporting: addresses (or identifying private homes directly or indirectly); medical information; and information obtained in personal communications including email or limited access social media. The English law can be used to protect an individual’s privacy rights no matter where in the world that person is based.</p><p>In cases involving bereavement or shock, sensitivity and discretion are especially important, not only because of the personal impact on individuals but also because, in line with industry-wide guidelines, we do not permit any public interest justification for intruding into a person’s grief. We should not report gratuitous information about a person’s death or make light of genuine tragedies. Images of dead bodies (especially if the individual is identifiable) should be avoided except in exceptional circumstances, for instance in connection to reporting atrocities of war.</p><p>The Data Protection Act has the potential to impact journalists in two ways: 1) you might try to obtain information from people or organisations that will cite the Act as a reason for refusing to divulge information; and/or 2) as a person who is processing data, you have to comply with the Act when writing about personal information. More information about this is contained in the Data Protection Policy, and you should seek advice from your department head or the Group’s head of legal if you have any queries.</p><p><strong>Privacy - and pictures</strong></p><p>Individuals must not be photographed or filmed in places where they have a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ – nor should we knowingly publish material resulting from such photography/filming, whether created by us or by another person. This does not only refer to private property owned by the individual in question. Churches, cafes, places of work and hotels have all been regarded as places where there can be a reasonable expectation of privacy, and even public beaches. However, each case must be judged on its merits and you should discuss with relevant senior executives, the managing editor’s office or the Group’s legal advisers if in doubt.</p><p>If material is well-established in the public domain, that may over-ride the usual privacy protections. However, you must not work on the premise that, because you can access a picture publicly, it is therefore automatically safe for use.</p><p><strong>Privacy - pictures of children and vulnerable adults</strong></p><p>Under-16s must not be photographed or filmed on subjects about their welfare – or the welfare of other children – without the consent of their custodial parent/guardian. It is imperative that there is no room for debate about whether consent has been granted and you should always seek clarity before photographing/filming, if there is any doubt. This restriction, as well as the restriction on interviewing children referred to above, carries over into publication. In essence, even if the information or pictures have not come directly from the child him or herself (eg they might have come from another person who knows them), we should consider whether their <u>use</u> without permission might infringe their privacy.</p><p>A public interest justification for breaching these requirements must be classed as ‘exceptional’. You should seek advice from your department head and, if appropriate, from the managing editor’s office. You may also need to seek legal advice.</p><p>You must also be particularly careful not to do anything which could amount to taking advantage of vulnerable adults, which means those who are or may be in need of care services by reason of ‘mental or other disability, age or illness’ and who may be unable to protect themselves against ‘significant harm or exploitation’. If you are entering a non-public area of a hospital (or similar institution) you will need to obtain permission from a senior executive of the hospital, unless there is a public interest justification for not doing so.</p><p><strong>Privacy – material from social media</strong></p><p>Social media provides a wealth of information, some of which may legitimately be used by mainstream media. However, the internet can present an ethical vacuum and you should not assume that simply because something appears online it can be published by us. You must make a careful assessment of the veracity of information you find online – and of its apparent origins. For instance, can you be sure who uploaded the information: how do you prove that the person who apparently tweeted, commented or uploaded a photograph actually did so themselves?</p><p>It is also vital to consider whether republication in a major news outlet might invade someone’s privacy. Some of the things to consider in this regard are:</p><ul><li>What is the nature of the material (is it intrinsically private)?</li><li>Who uploaded it and why? Did they intend that it be widely published?</li><li>How widely has it been/can it be seen?</li><li>Has that person waived their right to privacy in whole or as regards this particular aspect?</li><li>Is there the public interest to justify a possible invasion of privacy?</li></ul><p>Remember that a person’s right to privacy is not automatically lost simply because material about them has circulated online to some degree.</p><p><strong>Your use of social media</strong></p><p>As a journalist employed by or associated with the Group, material which you publish– for example, tweets, blogs, comments and images – helps our titles and websites gain exposure, audience and profile. However, there is potential for the Group to suffer reputational damage as a consequence of what you publish, even if you intend it only to be in a personal capacity. Despite the apparent informality and carefree feel of such online activities, they are publications in law and carry all the same implications.</p><p>If you have concerns about the conduct of another social media user towards you, please raise it immediately with your department head and, if appropriate, the managing editor’s office.</p><p>See the Social Media and Online Activities Policy for more information.</p><p><strong>Responsibility of editorial staff and contributors</strong></p><p>It is the responsibility of every department head, but also everyone working for the Group, whatever their status, to ensure that you follow up anything that might appear to you to be incorrect, even to a minor extent, or which raises any alarm bells from a legal or editorial point of view - whether or not you yourself are responsible for that material. You should pass any concerns to the managing editor or the head of legal as appropriate.</p><p>AFTER PUBLICATION</p><p><strong>Complaints Handling</strong></p><p>If you receive any kind of complaint about a story you have been involved with, you should direct complainants to the online complaint forms available – and in serious or urgent cases forward concerns directly to your department head and the managing editor as soon as possible. You should generally not make any response on your own initiative, however insignificant it might seem. If you indicate that a remedial course of action might be possible - which could include an apology or correction, promising a change to the online article, or running a letter – this could be construed as an admission of liability on behalf of the Group. Hence, you should not do so without the express approval of the managing editor or the head of legal. You should co-operate fully with any investigations undertaken by the managing editor or the head of legal in response to such complaints, and make full disclosure of all information, including documentary evidence, in your possession or of which you are aware.</p><p><strong>Corrections</strong></p><p>If we publish information that turns out to be inaccurate it is important that the position be corrected. Sometimes an online amendment may be suitable, at other times it may be appropriate to publish a correction or an apology in print or broadcast a statement. Decisions about remedial action should be made in conjunction with the managing editor and, where appropriate, the head of legal.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:59:49+00:00</pubDate><guid>2656245461</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image"/><dc:creator>Indy100 Staff</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:59:49+00:00</dc:date><category>Service</category></item><item><title>User Commitment</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/service/user-commitment</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Here at indy100.com we want to make sure that by joining our community of users for whatever reason, whether to comment on our content or receive a more tailored experience, you are clear about what you are signing up for.

These cookies are designed to allow the website to recognise its users on subsequent visits, or to authorise other designated websites to recognise these users for a particular purpose.</p><p>Cookies do a lot of different jobs which make your experience of the Internet much smoother and more interactive. For instance, they are used to remember your preferences on sites you visit often, to remember your user ID and the contents of your shopping baskets, and to help you navigate between pages more efficiently. They also help ensure that the advertisements that you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. Some data collected is designed to detect browsing patterns and approximate geographical location to improve user experience.</p><p>Some websites may also use web beacons (also known as pixels or tags) to collect information, which are embedded in images. Web beacons only collect limited information, including a cookie number, a timestamp, and a record of the page on which they are placed. Websites may also carry web beacons placed by third party advertisers. These beacons do not carry any personally identifiable information and are only used to track the effectiveness of a particular campaign (for example by counting the number of visitors).</p><p>Information collected by cookies is now classed as personal data.</p><h3>Related links</h3><ul><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/user-policies" target="_self">User Policies</a></li><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/privacy-notice" target="_self">Privacy Notice</a></li><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/code-of-conduct" target="_self">Code of Conduct</a></li><li><a href="https://help.independent.co.uk/hc/en-us/requests/new" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Complaint Form</a></li><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/contact-us" target="_self">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/contact-us" target="_self"></a><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/external-contributors-policy" target="_self">External Contributors Policy</a></li><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/service/competition-ts-cs" target="_self">Competition Ts & Cs</a></li><li><a href="https://rebel.indy100.com/user-commitment" target="_self">User Commitment</a></li></ul><p><strong>How do we use cookies?</strong></p><p>We collect a number of cookies from our users for various reasons, not least to track our own performance – but also to let us serve you content tailored to your own specifications, hopefully improving your overall experience of the website.

We sometimes include links on our site to goods and services offered by third parties and we may be paid some commission if you subsequently decide to make a purchase. Cookies may be used to track your visits to third party sites to help ensure that we are paid the correct amounts. Please note that these commercial arrangements do not influence our editorial content in any way.</p><p>We believe that your experience of the site would be adversely affected if you opted out of the cookies we use.</p><p><strong>What types of cookie are there and which ones do we use?</strong></p><p>There are two types of cookie:</p><ul><li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> remain on a user’s device for a set period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.</li><li><strong>Session cookies</strong> are temporary. They allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.</li></ul><p>Cookies also have, broadly speaking, four different functions and can be categorised as follow: ‘strictly necessary’ cookies, ‘performance’ cookies, ‘functionality’ cookies and ‘targeting’ or ‘advertising’ cookies.</p><p><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> are essential to navigate around a website and use its features. Without them, you wouldn’t be able to use basic services like registration or shopping baskets. These cookies do not gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p><p>Examples of how we use ‘strictly necessary’ cookies include:</p><p>• Setting unique identifiers for each unique visitor, so site numbers can be analysed.</p><p>• Allowing you to sign in to Indy100.com as a registered user or subscriber.</p><p><strong>Performance cookies</strong> collect data for statistical purposes on how visitors use a website, they don’t contain personal information such as names and email addresses, and are used to improve your user experience of a website.</p><p>Here are some examples of how we use performance cookies:</p><ul><li>Gathering data about visits to the website, including numbers of visitors and visits, length of time spent on the site, pages clicked on or where visitors have come from.</li><li>For comparison with other websites using data collected by industry-accepted measurement and research companies.</li></ul><p>Information supplied by performance cookies helps us to understand how you use the website; for example, whether or not you have visited before, what you looked at or clicked on and how you found us. We can then use this data to help improve our services. We generally use independent analytics companies to perform these services for us and when this is the case, these cookies may be set by a third party company (third party cookies).</p><p>If you have registered with the website we can combine the data from the web analytics services and their cookies with the information you have supplied to us, so that we can make your experience more personal by recommending certain articles to you based on your reading behaviour or tailoring your emails with content you might find more interesting. We would only do this if you have given us permission to communicate with you. Sometimes the data used from the web analytics companies has been collected before you registered or signed in. In these cases, if we use this data to identify you, we use it only in accordance with our privacy notice.</p><p><strong>Functionality cookies</strong> allow users to customise how a website looks for them: they can remember usernames, language preferences and regions, and can be used to provide more personal services like local weather reports and traffic news.</p><p>Here are some examples of how we use functionality cookies:</p><ul><li>Storing your user preferences on Your Account page</li><li>Remembering if you’ve been to the site before so that messages intended for first-time users are not displayed to you.</li></ul><p><strong>Advertising cookies</strong> are used to deliver advertisements more relevant to you, but can also limit the number of times you see an advertisement, and be used to chart the effectiveness of an ad campaign by tracking users’ clicks. They can also provide security in transactions. They are usually placed by third-party advertising networks with a website operator’s permission, but can be placed by the operator themselves. They can remember that you have visited a website, and this information can be shared with other organisations, including other advertisers. They cannot determine who you are though, as the data collected is never linked to your profile.</p><p>The main ways we use advertising cookies are set out below:</p><ul><li>Interest-based advertising (or online behavioural advertising) is where cookies are placed on your device by our third party service providers which remember your web browsing activity and group together your interests in order to provide you with targeted advertisements which are more relevant to you when you visit independent.co.uk. Your previous web browsing activity can also be used to infer things about you, such as your demographics (age, gender etc). This information may also be used to make the advertising on independent.co.uk more relevant to you.</li><li>‘Retargeting’ is a form of interest-based advertising that enables our advertising partners to show you advertisements selected based on your online browsing activity away from the website. This allows companies to advertise to people who previously visited their website. These cookies will usually be placed on your device by third-party advertising networks and we have listed the main third party networks we work with in our consent management platform.</li><li>Social media. Occasionally we advertise our products and services to our readers who are on social media. This could be to promote our subscriptions offers or events. We use cookies to help with this process, and the social media operator (Facebook for example) can recognise Indy100.com readers who are on their platform and serve them advertisements on our behalf. You can opt out of this process by managing your preferences in our consent management platform.</li></ul><p>Without these cookies, online advertisements you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests.</p><p><strong>How do I manage my cookies?</strong></p><p>You should be aware that any preferences will be lost if you delete all cookies and many websites will not work properly or you will lose some functionality. We do not recommend turning cookies off when using our website for these reasons.</p><p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can alter the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. Generally you have the option to see what cookies you’ve got and delete them individually, block third party cookies or cookies from particular sites, accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is issued or reject all cookies.

VARIATION OF THESE TERMS</strong></p><p>1. These Terms will not be varied, the only exception to that would be in the event that a Director of the Company or the Editor has expressly agreed in writing to a variation. If any Freelancer or external contributor is not happy with these Terms then they should not offer the Company any Material, nor accept a commission, nor post any comments on the Website including Blogs. Any Material posted or supplied to the Company for publication is deemed to have been supplied in full knowledge and acceptance of these Terms.</p><p>2. The Company may change these Terms at any time by posting the changes online and it is your responsibility to check them every time you: submit Material for publication, access the blog or forum areas of the Company’s Websites or wish to make a comment. If any freelancer or blogger is not happy with these Terms then they should not offer us any Material or accept a commission from us. Any Material supplied to us for publication is deemed to have been supplied in full knowledge and acceptance of the most recent updated Terms as displayed on the Company’s Websites. Your continued or renewed use of the Company’s Websites after such changes are posted means you agree to be bound by these Terms as amended.</p><p><strong>C. EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTIONS COVERED BY THESE TERMS</strong></p><p><strong>Material supplied by:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Freelancers</strong></p><p>- The Company is happy to publish Material which is supplied by freelance contributors (‘Freelancers’); it is showcased in the titles daily and appreciated worldwide by readers and users of the Websites.</p><p>- Freelancers should be aware that these Terms are the terms of business that will apply to all Material you provide however supplied - commissioned, sent on spec or any other arrangement.</p><p><strong>2.Bloggers</strong></p><p>- The Company also considers and on occasion publishes Material which has been researched and written by ‘Bloggers’.

These Terms similarly apply to all Material that Bloggers provide to the Company whether commissioned or sent on spec.</p><p>- Section D contains specific additional terms and conditions relevant to you if you are a Freelancer or Blogger (see below).</p><p><strong>3. Contributors of User-Generated Content</strong></p><p>- The Company wishes to encourage the broadest exchange of news and information to encourage stimulating, informative and above all intelligent debate.

As is the case with other publishers, the Company needs to have certain rights to allow it to make further use of the contents of the newspaper titles and Websites.</p><p>In addition to the content of the Company’s publications appearing online on the Website, Material is also supplied by the Company to the websites of other third party hosts, thereby ensuring that the quality writing the Company publishes is widely available to interested readers on a variety of websites.</p><p>Content is further supplied by the Company to a range of newspapers, magazines, websites, on mobile and tablet apps, and other media outlets rights are licensed to a range of third parties.</p><p><strong>The Company will require the exclusive right to first publication in any medium in the case of commissioned Material; if not, this will be made clear to you in writing by your editorial contact at the Company. There may be occasions when there is a delay in publishing your Material. Should this be the case, after a reasonable time has elapsed from the date when you submitted your Material, it may be possible to request a waiver by the Company of its exclusive right to first publication of your Material. Such a variation to these Terms must be negotiated with your editorial contact at the Company in writing.</strong></p><p>Unless otherwise agreed:</p><p>(a).

You are free to store and allow access to your Material on databases for personal purposes provided nothing competes or conflicts with the rights you have granted the Company; and</p><p>(c)(ii) in respect of all of the above, the right to translate, amend, cut or alter your Material as the Company thinks appropriate.</p><p>(c)(iii) the right to authorise NLA Media Access (“NLA”) to distribute or license the distribution of your Material for NLA’s licensed acts and purposes as amended from time to time.</p><p>(d) The exercise by you of any of these rights is conditional on it not leading to any conflict of interest with the Company, and to your procuring a proper acknowledgement to the Company and its product is given on any further use of your Material together where possible with a link to the Material on the Website.</p><p>(e) You agree that the Company can use an image of you in association with your Material for purposes of publicity, promotion and any other activity related to the exercise of its rights under these Terms.</p><p><strong>D.2) PAYMENT / CONSIDERATION</strong></p><p>D.2.(a) If your editorial contact from the Company has agreed to pay you a fee for your Material, such a fee will be a single all-inclusive fee for all the rights granted above (including the syndication rights in D.1). If such a fee has been agreed, and there follows a one-off syndication of an individual Contribution to an end-user customer for print publication, you will additionally receive 50% of the net revenue received by the Company.</p><p>The Company operates a self billing system for the payment of freelance Contributions. New Freelancers should supply their payment details and email address to the commissioning editor or the person to whom they have arranged to supply their Material, on the first occasion of supply. Unless any other rate or fee is agreed at the time of commission/ agreement any payment will be made at the Company's prevailing rates.</p><p>Payment will be made at the end of the month following the month of publication of the Material.</p><p>D.2.(b) Whether or not a monetary fee has been agreed, you agree that for your Material to be considered for publication is adequate consideration for the rights granted herein.</p><p><strong>D.3) EDITORIAL STANDARDS</strong></p><p>The reputation of the Independent brand, in the UK and around the world, is based on the editorial independence, integrity and high journalistic standards of the Company's publications.

You will not at any time dispose of any materials which could be relevant to a potential complaint without our prior approval. You agree to notify us at once should you discover anything which could render your Material or a story wholly or partly based on your Material risky from a legal or regulatory point of view or potentially place you in breach of any of these Terms.</p><p>You agree that you will not talk to any person about a complaint without our prior approval and will maintain confidence in the story before publication and, as far as is appropriate, after publication.</p><p>One matter in the Company's Code of Conduct that requires immediate action is that you must tell us about any potential conflict of interest, whether actual or potential, as well as anything which could possibly be perceived as such. You should raise any issue, preferably in writing by email to the person with whom you have contact in the Company.</p><p>It is also a term of acceptance of your Material that you agree to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.</p><p>If you have any query on these points, or uncertainty about any aspect of conduct or the Material you are submitting, you should raise it with the person with whom you have contact in the Company.</p><p><strong>D.4) WARRANTIES, INDEMNITIES AND LIABILITY</strong></p><p>D.4.(i).

The Judges shall, unless provided otherwise in the competition instructions, be the Editor for the time being of indy100.com or of The Independent and/or his nominated representative(s), and "Judges" herein shall mean such person or persons. In the case of a competition involving the judging of skill there shall be at least one judge independent of  indy100.com/The Independent and any promoters, and the identity of that Judge may be given in the competition instructions. The identity of the Judges may be requested by sending a stamped addressed envelope to Promotions, Independent Digital News & Media Ltd, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT.</p><p>2.1 The general principle is fairness: entries or votes should be made or cast fairly. If, in the opinion of the Judges this principle has been flouted, they can declare any entries or votes invalid, void the competition, change the competition instructions, or adjust the entries or the voting to achieve fairness, as they think fit. The competition instructions may carry a specific indication, but in the absence of such an indication, only one entry/ vote per entrant (or household, computer or other unit as appropriate) will be permitted.</p><p>2.2 The decision of the Judges over every instance shall be final and unchallengeable and in their absolute discretion they may declare void any entry/ vote or the competition itself should they consider that there are no entries reaching a required standard, whereupon they can award prizes or not as they think fit. Judges shall have the right, at their discretion, to change the rules of a competition while it is running if it appears to them that it would be equitable or appropriate to do so, including the extension of the closing date whereupon there will be an announcement of any such extension at the first reasonable opportunity. No correspondence will be entered into or comment issued on any matters concerning any competition, and no reasons given for any decision made by the Judges.</p><p>3. All competitions are open to UK residents aged 18 or over unless any other age restriction is specified or implied. Where entrants are required to enter in one of several age categories, the applicable category shall be that appropriate to their age on the closing date of the competition. Entrants should, if under 18, obtain permission in advance from their parent or guardian and be able to demonstrate that to the Judges's satisfaction. Employees of IDNM, regular contributors and contractors, the promoters and individuals connected with any company involved in the competition, agents and members of the immediate family of the above people will not be eligible to participate.</p><p>4.1 All entries must be legible, written in ink or ballpoint pen, and made on the official form, if there is one, or the official page on the website (<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk" target="_blank">www.indy</a>100.com or any other website associated with IDNM as appropriate). They must be clearly marked with the entrant's name, address, email address and telephone number as requested. Any illegible, mutilated, altered, corrupted or multiple entry may be disqualified.</p><p>4.2 Entries must be made in accordance with the competition instructions. They are invalid if they are received any later than the specified closing time (which shall be London date and time).</p><p>4.3 In the case of token collect or voucher promotions, only originals are valid. No tokens or vouchers are redeemable for cash. The provisions of Rule 11 apply to such promotions unless expressly excluded.</p><p>4.4 All questions must be answered and all other entry requirements fulfilled, including in any ‘pay to enter’ competition each entry must be accompanied by the appropriate entry fee or proof of purchase as appropriate.</p><p>4.5 Proof of submission or of posting of a form will not constitute proof of delivery and no responsibility will be accepted for lost, corrupted, delayed or mislaid entries.</p><p>4.6 The winner will be chosen in accordance with the competition instructions and the exercise of their residual discretion by the Judges, and either will be the first correct entry drawn from the total entries or all entries will be examined and the prize awarded to the entry that the Judges consider to be the best.</p><p>4.7 Other prizes will be awarded in accordance with the order of priority as stated in the individual competition.</p><p>5. IDNM reserves the right to publish the names of the winners and runners-up, and the winning entries themselves, and all winners are required to give their full co-operation to all requests by IDNM or a promoter in connection with publicity for the competition, their entry, the prize or otherwise.</p><p>6. IDNM shall have the following rights over all winning entries:- the exclusive, irrevocable, worldwide licence to first publication; and a non-exclusive licence to publish, syndicate, distribute, reproduce and exploit the material in all present and future media and formats and to sub-license these rights to others. Entries, however submitted, will not be returned by IDNM.</p><p>7. There will be no cash or other alternative to the prize offered and prizes are not transferable.</p><p>8. Where applicable, prize winners will be responsible for organising valid passport(s) and for securing any necessary visas or complying with other regulation. They are also strongly advised to take out adequate insurance and health advice. Dates, destinations and other specific details of a prize are subject to availability.</p><p>9.1 IDNM will not be liable for any circumstances beyond its reasonable control that prevent the competition being fulfilled, a winner or winners being chosen, or any prize being taken up or fully enjoyed by a winner. IDNM excludes liability to the extent permitted by law for any cost, claims or losses howsoever caused that arise by reason of any person's entry into a competition or the award, or non award, to them of a prize. In the event of any error, whether printing, technological or otherwise, which affects the competition in any way, the Judges reserve the right to administer the competition as though the error had not occurred.</p><p>9.2 If any winner of a competition is unable to take up a prize for any reason, or if IDNM has not been able, after making reasonable efforts, to make contact with the winner, IDNM reserves the right to award that prize (without notice to the first winner chosen) to an alternative winner, in which case the first winner chosen shall not be eligible for any share of the prize whatsoever. IDNM shall not have any liability in such eventuality.</p><p>10. Where necessary in order to determine an outright winner or winners in a competition, the Judges reserve the right to require that entrants take part in an eliminating contest (or 'tie breaker'). If for any reason there are more winners than prizes, whether or not that has arisen as an unforeseen eventuality or is part of the competition structure, the Judges reserve the right to conduct a draw to determine the winner or winners of the prizes.</p><p>11. In any competition where there are only a limited number of prizes, unless it is otherwise provided no purchase of the newspaper or otherwise is necessary for entry, except in competitions of skill or where competition instructions clearly specify otherwise.</p><p>12. Names of major prize winners will be available on receipt of a request enclosing a stamped addressed envelope to: Promotions, IDNM, 2 Derry Street, London, W8 5TT, and this information may be published on the website at the Judges' discretion.</p><p>13. Entrants may be asked to indicate their wish, by ticking or checking a box provided in the competition instructions or otherwise, to receive or decline to receive communications with information or carefully selected commercial opportunities from IDNM or agents on their behalf. IDNM will hold any personal details it is entitled to hold on its own or a duly authorised agent's registered database for the purposes of optimising its editorial and commercial offering to readers and website users, actual or potential. Entrants will also be asked to indicate their consent to have that data used from time to time by other carefully selected organisations who may be licensed by IDNM to use it.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:27:02+00:00</pubDate><guid>2655937906</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image"/><dc:creator>Indy100 Staff</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 15:27:02+00:00</dc:date><category>Service</category></item><item><title>CHecking</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/test-feed/checking</link><description><![CDATA[<p>CHecking</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 12:15:06+00:00</pubDate><guid>2656244274</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image"/><dc:creator>Francisco Rebel Alternative</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 12:15:06+00:00</dc:date><category>Test Feed</category></item><item><title>Health minister can’t answer how many NHS staff have left because of Brexit in excruciating interview</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/politics/brexit-nhs-staff</link><description><![CDATA[<p>A minister was unable to answer how many NHS staff have left the country due to Brexit in an embarassing interview on Wednesday morning.</p><p>Care and mental health minister Gillian Keegan fumbled during an interview on <em>Good Morning Britain </em>after Susanna Reid pressed her on the figures amid rising staff absences in hospitals throughout the UK due to coronavirus.</p><p>She said: “I don’t have that number” before trying to change the subject by explaining the government’s EU resettlement scheme.</p><p>Reid tried to ask again and Keegan said again “I don’t have that number” to which Reid replied “I’m asking you why not?”</p><p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/newsletters?itm_channel=native&itm_campaign=footer&itm_audience=prospecting&itm_content=newsletters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>Sign up</strong></a><strong> to our new free Indy100 weekly newsletter</strong></p><p>“We don’t measure our NHS staff by where they come from,” Keegan said.</p><p>“We have more NHS staff in general and they’ve come from all over... and there’s also lots more medical schools and nursing schools been set up here to help our own young people or people who want to retrain...”</p><p>Reid said: “So according to figures, and this is two years ago, more than 22,000 EU nationals have left the NHS since the Brexit referendum.
