    <content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;T&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;wo years on&lt;/span&gt; from the start of the coronavirus pandemic, let me tell you what life is like in my Hong Kong neighborhood. Playgrounds are wrapped in red-and-white
      caution tape and barricaded with plastic fencing to keep children out, and the swings have been tossed over the crossbar to ensure that no illicit amusement takes place. The government’s disastrous public messaging about a possible citywide lockdown
      has led to widespread panic-buying, so gossip swapped while I’m out walking my dog focuses on which shops have restocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All restaurants have to close at 6 p.m., and bars aren’t open at all. A restaurant down the street from my
      apartment now offers happy-hour deals starting at 10 a.m. Gyms, movie theaters, campsites, and beaches have been shut down entirely. If I want to take a walk on my own in a remote country park, I am legally required to wear a
      mask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This situation feels all the more shocking because in early 2020, Hong Kong was ahead of the COVID curve, not lagging behind it. As soon as news emerged of a still-mysterious virus, everyone here began wearing masks and
      adapted to social distancing almost immediately; I wrote article after article about what life would look like in the weeks to come in America, having seen the future myself. While the West was caught off guard, Hong Kong felt
      prepared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now medical facilities are overwhelmed with sick patients, and because morgues have struggled to keep pace, body bags are piled up in hospitals alongside patients still receiving treatment. Coffins are being shipped in to
      meet the demand. Construction workers are racing to build isolation facilities, including one that looks like a wartime field hospital on the border with the mainland. Some 300,000 people are in isolation or under home quarantine. After recording
      only 213 deaths and about 13,000 cases of COVID-19 from January 2020 to early 2022, the city is swamped by the current Omicron wave, which began at the start of the year and has led to more than 960,000 cases and more than 4,600
      deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong was lauded for controlling the coronavirus’s spread with its “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/china-covid-zero-policy-restrictions/621476/?utm_source=feed"&gt;zero-COVID
      strategy&lt;/a&gt;.” It has ample vaccine doses. It is wealthy enough to support its poorest people if it chooses to. It has effectively shut down swaths of its economy, including its lucrative tourism sector, to battle the
      virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yet this month, it recorded one of the highest COVID death rates &lt;em&gt;in the world. &lt;/em&gt;What just happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;H&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;ong Kong has employed&lt;/span&gt;
      its zero-COVID strategy since the onset of the pandemic. The approach has not been as restrictive as the one used in mainland China, which calls for &lt;a
      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-03-13/china-places-all-shenzhen-residents-under-lockdown-afp"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; whole metropolises and testing their population over a handful of COVID cases. The city has an aggressive
      test-and-trace program, as well as toughened border controls, to catch infections and break transmission lines, and enacts social-distancing measures when cases spike. All of this helped Hong Kong buy itself time in the early stages of the pandemic,
      when vaccines were not available, keeping deaths to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now it clings to measures not based on sound science, and which experts have dismissed as largely performative (while also being heavily damaging to its travel- and
      service-based economy). Neither has it pivoted to a more flexible approach, nor prepared for an outbreak that analysts repeatedly warned was inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The missteps are almost too numerous to recount, but the worst ones have to do
      with Hong Kong’s singular inability to vaccinate its population. The government’s efforts were from the start imbued with politics and marred by poor messaging. It initially rushed through approval of the China-made Sinovac vaccine, and city leaders
      made a show of being inoculated with it, despite a better option—BioNTech’s mRNA jab—being available. (The large majority of deaths have been among the unvaccinated, but officials refuse to disclose data on which vaccine was administered to those who
      died after being vaccinated.) Press releases highlighting, with little context, the vaccine’s adverse effects were amplified by the media, leading to intense skepticism. Distrust in the government, still lingering from its handling of prodemocracy
      protests in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/04/hong-kong-trust-vaccine/618469/?utm_source=feed"&gt;did not help the cause&lt;/a&gt;. And most troubling has been the poor vaccination rate among the city’s
      elderly population, a persistent problem. Today, just 55 percent of people older than 80 have received &lt;a href="https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk/en/dashboard/"&gt;one vaccine shot&lt;/a&gt;, and 36 percent have received two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lam
      Ching-choi, a physician and a member of Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s cabinet, told me that the government’s early reliance on family doctors to advise patients on vaccination was a mistake: Many warned the elderly to be cautious about receiving the
      vaccine. Predictably, COVID has swept through residential care homes—more than 29,000 eldery care-home residents have been infected during the current wave. Lam also told me that the government should have offered at-home vaccination for residents
      with mobility issues, and said the authorities would soon begin implementing that program. Yet it will start only next week, more than two months into the surge and more than a year after the vaccine rollout initially began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
      21-day hotel quarantine required for all arrivals into Hong Kong, even for those without COVID, is &lt;a href="https://www.otandp.com/blog/is-hong-kongs-21-day-quarantine-evidence-based-or-justified"&gt;dangerous and unscientific&lt;/a&gt;, experts
      told me, but the government has continued the practice anyway, leading to cross infections and a spike in cases. A &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-393X/9/7/696"&gt;government-funded study&lt;/a&gt; published last year warned about vaccine
      hesitancy, but officials did little beyond sloganeering and a perfunctory poster drive. The government also insisted on issuing compulsory testing notices to residents even when testing and quarantine facilities were already overloaded, leading to
      more stress on a teetering health system. Flight bans from countries including the United States and Britain are scheduled to be in place until next month, though the government’s own advisors say there is no reason for this to
      continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sum, decision makers ignored public-health expertise, driven instead by politics and overly enthusiastic efforts to show fealty to Beijing. The result has been an embarrassingly shambolic effort that has created a
      preventable public-health disaster, yet another glaring failure of governance from an administration whose defining characteristic is catastrophic ineptitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The question to ask, not unreasonably, would be: How come we either
      didn’t have a good plan or didn’t execute a good plan?” Gabriel Leung, the dean of medicine at the University of Hong Kong and a pandemic-response adviser to the government, told me. When I asked whether he had any thoughts on the answer to that
      question, Leung responded, “Suffice to say that we have done our very best to generate the best science to inform policy decisions. And, as Margaret Thatcher once said, ‘Advisers advise; ministers decide.’ Let’s put it at that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

      &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;M&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;uch of the world&lt;/span&gt; has struggled with various phases of the pandemic, but Hong Kong’s difficulties are in no small part due to the fact that the city no longer has even
      its previous limited democratic accountability to push the government to review public-health decisions, thanks to a crackdown by Beijing and the imposition of a draconian national-security law. For varying reasons, many residents believed the
      government’s fiction that only a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sp8nPxZgn-4"&gt;small minority&lt;/a&gt; of people would be affected by these changes, but the mishandling of COVID has highlighted how the reengineering of Hong Kong will
      touch all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With opposition voices &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/03/hong-kong-prodemocracy-protesters-trial/618356/?utm_source=feed"&gt;silenced&lt;/a&gt;, Hong Kong’s rulers
      claimed they could more efficiently govern. But in the city legislature, overhauled last year to ensure that nationalism and obedience are valued over competence and political know-how, suggestions on how to tame the outbreak have included the wildly
      impractical (using cruise ships as temporary isolation facilities) and the patently absurd (dropping fresh food into Hong Kong by drone). Even this newfound sense of urgency on the part of lawmakers and the government has emerged only after Chinese
      President Xi Jinping spoke last month of the “overriding mission” to bring the current outbreak under control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, pro-Beijing pundits and mainland officials have cast pandemic response, and adherence to “dynamic zero
      COVID,” as a loyalty test. (Determining what exactly “dynamic zero COVID” means is futile; the description shifts from official to official and day to day. Nevertheless, authorities insist that it shouldn’t be questioned.) The director of China’s
      Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said this month that “patriotic forces must forcefully expose, criticize, and sanction with laws the anti-China destabilizing forces who launched smearing attacks, spread rumors, and created panic to disrupt the
      anti-pandemic efforts.” Addressing the United Nations, a Hong Kong doctor said that the idea of living with the virus was tantamount to the U.S. creating “biological terrorists,” in a &lt;a
      href="https://www.tkww.hk/a/202203/09/AP6227ef10e4b0cd9e1ce40580.html"&gt;melodramatic &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tkww.hk/a/202203/09/AP6227ef10e4b0cd9e1ce40580.html"&gt;screed&lt;/a&gt; that seemed scripted for a comic-book villain. Hong
      Kong’s civil service has become a targeted group, fingered as being polluted by Western ideas for questioning the COVID strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Hong Kong’s pandemic response definitely shows the NSL [national-security law] new order is not only
      about election and activists, but extends to all realms of life,” Ho-Fung Hung, a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and the author of the forthcoming book &lt;em&gt;City on the Edge: Hong Kong Under Chinese
      Rule&lt;/em&gt;, told me by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they did with the imposition of the national-security law, mainland officials felt the need to step in to address COVID-related problems that the Hong Kong government had created for itself, a
      move that has been met with slavish praise. Newspapers controlled by the Chinese government here have splashed their pages with adoration for workers arriving from over the border. Pro-Beijing lawmakers have rushed to social media to post their
      gratitude to the “motherland” for its support. My inbox fills up daily with statements thanking Beijing for taking control. The city’s secretary of health applauded the mainland’s donation of traditional Chinese medicine. (&lt;a
      href="https://www.hsa.gov.sg/announcements/news/advisorycovid-lianhuaqingwen"&gt;Authorities in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, by contrast, have warned that there is “no scientific evidence” that one such remedy, called lianhua qingwen, can be used “to prevent
      or treat COVID-19,” while Australia has &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-17/banned-chinese-medicine-lianhua-qingwen-in-australia-covid/100837934"&gt;banned the sale of the treatment entirely&lt;/a&gt;.) The endless, unrestrained
      flattery seems akin to the celebration of an arsonist who lights his house on fire, cuts the water hose, and then cheers as the fire brigade arrives to extinguish the flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the while, the broader political purge and repression
      of rights that was already under way in Hong Kong has carried on undisrupted. Half a dozen people were arrested and charged with sedition last month. In early March, the former head of the bar association, a British lawyer, was questioned by
      national-security police before he left the city, followed through the airport by reporters from Chinese state media. Authorities accused a &lt;a
      href="https://www.hongkongwatch.org/all-posts/2022/3/14/hong-kong-watch-co-founder-and-ceo-benedict-rogers-threatened-under-national-security-law"&gt;U.K.-based rights group of endangering national security&lt;/a&gt; and demanded that it take down
      its website. Carrie Lam, the city’s chief executive, employs wartime rhetoric as an excuse to exercise emergency powers. The longer the coronavirus outbreak persists, the more policies to combat it become intertwined with the ever-expanding security
      apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;L&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;isting Hong Kong’s mistakes&lt;/span&gt; triggers a sense of déjà vu: a politicized and inept response, an unwillingness to adapt existing strategies to the virus’s
      mutations, an inability to overcome vaccine skepticism, long-running fissures in society torn open by COVID. For years, we were told by pro-Beijingers that these were the West’s problems, not ours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, we looked at the
      U.S. and Europe, dumbstruck at how badly they were managing the pandemic. Two years on, we are experiencing what Siddharth Sridhar, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, &lt;a
      href="https://twitter.com/sid8998/status/1503581695357841409"&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as a “plane crash in slow motion,” having apparently learned little from the West’s—or our own—experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      creating devices that he hoped would help patients recover from serious brain trauma such as strokes. And he believed strongly in the potential of rehab technology—that with the right robot, he could relieve a whole array of brain
      injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then, one spring day in 2020, there was a horrible accident. And suddenly James had to apply everything he knew about science and rehabilitation to help fix his own family. The &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; senior

      href="mailto:conor@theatlantic.com"&gt;&lt;i&gt;conor@theatlantic.com&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;. I’ll publish a selection of correspondence in Friday’s newsletter.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conversations of
      Note&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debate is especially important during wartime, when the stakes of many judgments are higher, solidarity is more likely to be valued, and groupthink can cloud the judgment of whole nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the
      free-speech protections and culture that help safeguard our ability to debate here in America are never as threatened as they are during wars: It is historically commonplace in wartime for state officials and regular citizens alike to call for the
      criminalizing of dissent. Indeed, the ACLU was founded in 1920 amid the free speech crackdowns of World War I, when its founders &lt;a
      href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/free-speech#:~:text=The%20fight%20for%20freedom%20of,objectors%20and%20anti%2Dwar%20protesters."&gt;were&lt;/a&gt; “driven by the need to protect the constitutional rights of conscientious objectors and anti-war
      protesters.” The lessons of U.S. history are still lost on some Americans, judging by recent calls for authoritarian crackdowns on speech related to the war in Ukraine, including remarks from former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who is
      accused of spreading false Russian propaganda for expressing concern about “U.S. funded biolabs” in Ukraine and her worry that pathogens therein could escape as a consequence of fighting in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Tulsi Gabbard is parroting
      false Russian propaganda,” Senator Mitt Romney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/1503113473819041796?s=20&amp;amp;t=6Q5HXIm_Abxtp4UwC6HO0A"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt;. “Her treasonous lies may well cost lives.” But Gabbard engaged in
      constitutionally protected speech, not treasonous speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the ABC daytime talk show &lt;i&gt;The View&lt;/i&gt;, several hosts &lt;a
      href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-view-wants-doj-to-probe-tucker-carlson-and-tulsi-gabbard-for-russian-propaganda"&gt;suggested&lt;/a&gt; that Gabbard and Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host, should be investigated by federal authorities for
      peddling Russian propaganda. The broadcaster Keith Olbermann &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/1503467489572921346?s=20&amp;amp;t=-UBJc2mlBZTEosUcU5KOIw"&gt;agreed&lt;/a&gt;, telling his nearly 1 million followers, without
      evidence, “They are Russian Assets and there is a war. There’s a case for detaining them militarily. Trials are a sign of good faith and patience on the part of democracy.” In fact, there is no lawful case for detaining either of them militarily, and
      trials are a due-process right, not a courtesy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexandraChalup/status/1503578146137939968?s=20&amp;amp;t=EQEFqZ12_rsi89axf9sbZw"&gt;Alexandra Chalupa&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer,&lt;b&gt;
      &lt;/b&gt;tweeted,&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;“&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TuckerCarlson"&gt;@TuckerCarlson&lt;/a&gt; needs to be tried at The Hague as a disinformation agent in Putin’s war. Carlson is a war criminal aiding and abetting a hostile enemy
      of the U.S. while thousands of American veterans are risking their lives helping Ukraine defend the free world from Putin.” But Carlson has not, in fact, perpetrated any war crimes. Observers can and should challenge what Gabbard and Carlson say, but
      not their right to say it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Putin the Anti-Liberal&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cathy Young offers &lt;a href="https://quillette.com/2022/03/12/ukraine-and-the-pro-putin-right/"&gt;a detailed fisking&lt;/a&gt; of favorable Putin commentary on
      the populist right and concludes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The greatest irony of all, perhaps, is that the Western democracies’ powerful response to Russia’s aggression against Ukraine is precisely the kind of thing the “anti-woke” should
      celebrate—at least if they are genuinely committed to freedom. It is a perfect moment to push back against progressive narratives that denigrate the West and dismiss liberal democracy as little more than a façade for racist, misogynist, and
      homophobic “systems of oppression.” It is a moment when democratic capitalist countries are at last, perhaps for the first time since the early 1990s, rediscovering their identity as the Free World—and when the global tide of illiberalism could be
      reversed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/i&gt;, Paul Berman &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/13/putin-russia-war-ukraine-rhetoric-history/"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that Vladimir Putin is motivated by “a
      belief that dangers to the Russian state are external and ideological, instead of internal and structural.” More specifically, he fears that “liberal philosophy and republican practices from the West … will collide with the icy clouds of the Russian
      winter, and violent storms will break out, and nothing will survive.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;a href="https://www.eui.eu/news-hub?id=ukraine-and-the-clash-of-civilisation-theory-an-interview-with-oliver-roy"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;, the
      French political scientist Olivier Roy argued that in recent years, Putin’s Russia has been perceived by many conservative Christians in Europe and the U.S. as “the bulwark of traditional values, anti-LGBT and anti-abortion,” but invading Ukraine
      squandered that advantage:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Putin sacrificed all the soft power he had acquired over the last twenty years, which allowed him to be a global player, for a purely territorial vision of Russian power. The whole
      geostrategy of alliance with the populist right and Western religious conservatives, which made it difficult to exert pressure and sanctions against Moscow, vanished in thin air. In this respect, it is easy to see how &lt;a
      href="https://www.nouvelobs.com/election-presidentielle-2022/20220224.OBS54946/le-pen-et-zemmour-confrontes-a-leur-volte-face-sur-la-russie-de-poutine.html"&gt;his admirers are all backtracking&lt;/a&gt; … Today, Putin has become unjustifiable
      because he scares us. Today, all Europeans have a reflex of distrust. All Putin sympathisers or those who were in favour of finding agreements with the Russians … are now devalued. Their reaction is eloquent, they are dumbfounded, and they cannot
      even find a semblance of justification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Anti-Green Environmental Rules&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ezra Klein &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/opinion/berkeley-enrollment-climate-crisis.html"&gt;argues&lt;/a&gt; that in the present climate crisis, the government’s unduly onerous environmental regulation is a key problem:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;To conserve anything close to the climate we’ve had, we need to build as we’ve never built before, electrifying everything and constructing the green energy infrastructure to generate that electricity cleanly. As the climate writer Julian
      Brave NoiseCat once &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/opinion/texas-climate-change.html"&gt;put it to me&lt;/a&gt;, “If you want to stand athwart the history of emissions and yell ‘stop,’ you need to do really transformational
      things.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s where the environmental victories of yesteryear have become the obstacles of this year. Too many of the tactics and strategies and statutes are designed to stop transformational or even incremental projects from
      happening. Modest expansions to &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-ed-el-mercado-lorena-lawsuit-20180421-story.html"&gt;affordable housing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a
      href="https://sf.curbed.com/2017/2/7/14535206/geary-brt-lawsuit"&gt;bus service&lt;/a&gt; are forced to answer for their environmental impact. But the status quo doesn’t have to win any lawsuits or fill out any forms to persist. “The problem is a
      bunch of the regulatory law doesn’t penalize or regulate pollution,” Alex Trembath, the deputy director of the Breakthrough Institute, an environmental think tank that favors technological solutions, told me. “It penalizes and regulates technology,
      infrastructure and growth—often quite explicitly. That’s how putatively environmental regulations are used to block laws that would lower pollution or make society more resource efficient.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Fool GOP Twice, Shame
      on GOP&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;National Review&lt;/i&gt;, Charles C. W. Cooke &lt;a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/03/no-to-trump-in-2024/"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that Donald Trump was a loser in his 2020 campaign against Joe Biden
      and insists that Republicans would be foolish to nominate him in 2024:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The idea should be absurd, risible, farcical, outré. It should be a punchline, a mania, the preserve of the demented fringe. Politics matters.
      And because politics matters, it is a bad idea to allow politics to be held hostage by someone who, in his heart of hearts, doesn’t really care. Donald Trump is an extraordinarily selfish man, and he is only too happy to subordinate your interests to
      his own. Why let him? It is one thing to say, “Well, he may have been a fickle boor, but I liked some of what he did once he was in office”; it’s quite another to put yourself through four more years of the man when you don’t have to.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;And please don’t tell me that the GOP should choose Trump again because “he fights.” The Republican Party now has a whole host of other candidates who “fight,” and none of them come with Trump’s baggage, his torpidness, his ill-discipline,
      his self-indulgence, his abject disregard for our constitutional order, or his pathological, unyielding, surrealistic dishonesty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Daylight Saving All-the-Time&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a tweet posted with the
      hashtag #LocktheClock, Senator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1503831261596499974"&gt;Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt; announced this week that “we passed out of the Senate my bill to make Daylight Savings Time permanent.” Senator &lt;a
      href="https://twitter.com/SenWhitehouse/status/1502721335453110274?s=20&amp;amp;t=EQEFqZ12_rsi89axf9sbZw"&gt;Sheldon Whitehouse&lt;/a&gt; added, “Americans are tired of changing their clocks twice a year. When winter comes, nobody wants to be sitting
      in the dark,” and called the time change an “outdated ritual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jbarro/status/1503811188269879297"&gt;Josh Barro&lt;/a&gt; dissented. “Permanent daylight saving would mean sunrise at
      8:58 in Detroit and 9:11 in Grand Rapids in December,” he pointed out. To which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/1503817325681602564"&gt;James Surowiecki&lt;/a&gt; retorted, “I never understand the assumption that ‘sunrise at
      8:58 in Detroit’ is self-evidently worse than sunset at 4:30 in Detroit in December, since to me the latter seems obviously worse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AliceFromQueens/status/1503834286687936520"&gt;Alice from
      Queens&lt;/a&gt;: “Daylight savings time discourse is just Early Birds vs Night Owls, with both types insisting they speak for everyone. For a night owl it’s not a tough decision. I’m never awake at 8 a.m. unless I’ve been up all night, in which case
      the last thing I want to see is the sun.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amid such disputes &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/therealbradbabs/status/1503815585326632969?s=20&amp;amp;t=EQEFqZ12_rsi89axf9sbZw"&gt;Bradley Babendir&lt;/a&gt; attempted to play
      peacemaker: “Whether you prefer standard time or daylight savings time, remember that those who disagree are not the enemy,” he wrote. “The duplicitous sun itself, hoarding its light while we fight for scraps, is the true
      enemy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Senate bill, which includes no sunset provision, will now go to the House.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Provocation of the Week: Against Tracking Until Trial&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;, two law
      professors, Kate Weisburd and Alicia Virani, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2022-03-15/electronic-monitoring-pretrial-bail-mass-incarceration"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; to an explosion in the number of people forced to wear electronic
      ankle monitors as a condition of pretrial release––in Los Angeles County, the figure rose from just 24 people in 2015 to more than 1,200 in 2021, as if monitoring were the new default. “For people who would otherwise be in jail, monitoring may be
      preferable,” they argue. “But for people who are monitored instead of being released on their own recognizance, monitoring reflects a dangerous expansion of the carceral state.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They add:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like in
      jail, people on monitors have &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3808657"&gt;little privacy&lt;/a&gt; and must comply with dozens of strict rules governing every aspect of daily life. Failing to &lt;a
      href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/incarcerated-home-rise-ankle-monitors-house-arrest-during-pandemic-n1273008"&gt;charge the monitoring device&lt;/a&gt;, changing a work or &lt;a
      href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-wp-md-cr-federal-prisoners-home-confinement-20210701-hoqdc5y7pna6jkrevr6pvak2vq-story.html"&gt;school schedule&lt;/a&gt; without permission or making an unauthorized trip to the grocery store can land
      someone back in jail for a technical violation. It is hardly surprising that in L.A. County, technical rule violations, not new criminal offenses, led to more than 90% of the terminations and reincarcerations applied to people on electronic
      monitors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to know what effect, if any, pandemic considerations had on the 2021 numbers, and what percentage of the more than 1,200 people monitored in that year would have been jailed
      otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Thanks for your contributions. I read every one that you send. By submitting an email, you’ve agreed to let us use it—in part or in full—in the newsletter and on our website. Published feedback may include a

      E20 Writeup — Drive My Car -----&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; is a special movie. It’s a film about language, but its silences carry the most powerful moments of communication. It’s a three-hour drama about grief, but the experience
      of watching it is breezily loose and oddly comforting. And it’s one of very few adaptations of the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/haruki-murakami-translators-david-karashima-review/616210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;renowned
      Japanese writer&lt;/a&gt; Haruki Murakami’s work, although the moments that best capture his style were invented by the director Ryûsuke Hamaguchi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these contradictions make &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; an &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/01/drive-my-car-murakami-adaptation-film-review/621293/?utm_source=feed"&gt;electrifying watch&lt;/a&gt;, but a difficult one to properly summarize. Now streaming on HBO Max and competing at the
      Academy Awards, it’s finding wider audiences that can experience its magic for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That awards attention marks another revealing contradiction: Despite Japan’s rich film history, including the filmmakers Akira Kurosawa and
      Hayao Miyazaki, &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; is the country’s most-nominated movie ever at the Oscars and its first to get the nod for Best Picture. It’s also the first non-English-language film from any country selected as Best Picture by all
      three major American critics groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recognition comes at a time of tentative hope for the future of international film. &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; won Best Non-English Language Film at the Golden Globes, an award whose
      last two winners were Lee Isaac Chung’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/02/minari/618009/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Minari&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and Bong Joon Ho’s &lt;em&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/parasite-and-curse-closeness/600385/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Parasite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt;’s nomination was &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/minari-and-the-invisible-stars-of-asian-led-movies/618169/?utm_source=feed"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; as a film set in Arkansas that deals with very American experiences around immigration
      and isolation. Despite having a script in both English and Korean, &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt; was nonetheless relegated to the foreign-language category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With international films making &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/minari-and-the-invisible-stars-of-asian-led-movies/618169/?utm_source=feed"&gt;halting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/parasite-oscars/606310/?utm_source=feed"&gt;hopeful&lt;/a&gt; progress toward recognition outside the old categories then, will they also find audiences? Will they—as Bong famously urged in
      2019—“overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen to David Sims, Shirley Li, and Lenika Cruz discuss on an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;’s culture podcast &lt;em&gt;The Review&lt;/em&gt;, where they break

      Car&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenika Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; is based on a Murakami short story of the same title. It follows a theater actor, playwright, and director named
      Yūsuke Kafuku as he directs an adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s &lt;em&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/em&gt; for a festival in Hiroshima. He suffers a loss at the beginning of the story and ends up forming this connection with a young woman who the festival hired
      to drive him in his red Saab 900. He resists this at first. But he’s won over by this quiet young chauffeur named Misaki Watari, and the two of them develop this interesting, quiet friendship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a film by a Japanese director
      based on an original work by a Japanese writer, but the play at the center is multilingual. The actors cast in it speak their native tongue: Japanese, Mandarin, Tagalog, and Korean Sign Language. And so the notion of people reaching across the
      distance of language is baked into the plot. It’s about the fundamental question of how we relate to one another: To what extent can we be comfortable with the things we don’t understand about one another and still feel
      empathy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, it’s digging into the gulfs between people that are spoken and unspoken. It is a difficult movie to summarize and yet, once you’re watching it, it’s not an inscrutable film at
      all. It’s not the kind of art film that feels very distancing. It is a very &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; drama about humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, the basics are pretty straightforward, but what sticks with you goes
      beyond the plot. It’s about the things that are not said, often between characters in the same scene. It’s the things that they intuit from the silences in between their words. It’s a really magical film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/03/drive-my-car-hamaguchi-language/626561/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Drive My Car pushes the limit of
      language&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;It is so fascinating to watch Kafuku’s acting process play out. He’s dealing with actors who at times grow frustrated because they don’t know what their acting partner
      is saying. They don’t know what to react off of. The style seems to be shutting down traditional models of communication, but Kafuku just tells them to do the work and it’s all going to make sense. What was your takeaway from his method and what the
      movie’s saying about language?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shirley Li: &lt;/strong&gt;The rehearsal scenes became really meditative for me. The actors were just reading instead of emoting. That felt like a moment when Hamaguchi was actively
      saying, “This is what you need to pay attention to. Pay attention to the spaces.” For a couple of years now, we’ve been talking about how foreign-language films are accessible. Bong Joon Ho said &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/movies/movies-subtitles-parasite.html#:~:text=%E2%80%9COnce%20you%20overcome%20the%20one,traction%20that%20%E2%80%9CParasite%E2%80%9D%20has."&gt;that great line&lt;/a&gt; about how subtitles are just a
      one-inch barrier that we need to get over. I appreciated that this film didn’t try to indicate what language was even being spoken in the subtitles. Even if I looked away, I still understood the scene as it was playing out because I wasn’t trying to
      focus on exactly what was being said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;And at no point does it explain the plot of &lt;em&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/em&gt; or what parallels it might have to &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt;, because it’s
      not about that. Kafuku is constantly telling the actors to let the text live within you. Just be the vessel for the text and say the words. And once you get the rhythm of the words, some transformation will happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li:
      &lt;/strong&gt;It’s about the creative process and how you reach the core of a character. Reading interviews, I found &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/books/letter-from-tokyo-brando-the-stones-and-banana-yoshimoto.html?timespastHighlight=It%E2%80%99s,enough,for,a,book,to,be,a,book,murakami?timespastHighlight=It%E2%80%99s,enough,for,a,book,to,be,a,book,murakami"&gt;one
      from 1990&lt;/a&gt; where Murakami said he didn’t want his works to be adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes, he’s against his novels being adapted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li: &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s enough for a
      book to be a book,” he said. And I take the rehearsal scenes as a direct argument against that. You can make a Chekhov play absolutely understandable just through emotions and spaces and intonation, rather than the language
      itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;I am a bit of a Murakami superfan. I have read the short story “Drive My Car,” which is in the collection &lt;em&gt;Men Without Women&lt;/em&gt;. And this movie also pulls from another
      couple of stories in that collection. But none of the stories have the high-concept &lt;em&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/em&gt;. That’s one of the many embellishments Hamaguchi is throwing onto this movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what I was amazed by when I first
      watched this movie is that it’s very difficult to nail the slightly removed, aloof tone of Murakami. It is not something that feels automatically visual and cinematic. And Hamaguchi really just understands that atmosphere better than anyone else I’ve
      seen try to do it. And I really do like some of the work on the adaptations. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve enjoyed Haruki Murakami. I’m glad you mentioned the short story. In it you see Kafuku’s
      backstory unfold through these conversations with his driver. But Hamaguchi chose not to use flashbacks. He wanted people to see the entire story from the beginning. And it’s so effective, I think, because, with a lot of stories about grief and loss,
      those flashbacks act as explanations for why a character is the way they are. But if you are just there from the beginning and you see this relationship with his wife as a living, breathing person before she dies, that simmers underneath the rest of
      the text and the rest of his interactions with people. You’re waiting for it to bubble up as opposed to having him just tell you. This is a movie that really shows, and tells very little. You’re constantly reading between the lines. And I think that
      creates a little bit of that remove you’re talking about, David. It doesn’t feel forced or cold. It’s a very warm and humane movie. And so I was also impressed by how he managed to get that tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li:
      &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, he doesn’t adapt Murakami in a way that you might expect, considering the way Murakami plays with memory and nested realities, but the visuals of this film are evocative of Murakami. It’s kind of a film that I think traffics in a
      lot of contradictions. It’s dealing with all of these intangible emotions and ideas, and yet it feels so grounded. It earns its long running time because it needs you to immerse completely into the reality of the story itself so that you start
      reading between the lines. There’s one scene in particular that I think we should talk about: in the back seat of the car, when Kafuku talks to the man he’d seen his wife cheat on him with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, on the surface, you could sum it up
      as a conversation between two men who share a love for the same woman. But the way Hamaguchi films it, the way the shadows move across the younger man’s face and across the older man’s face, and the way that you see the landscape continue to move
      around the car, it becomes spooky. It becomes much richer. And that’s what Murakami gets at: something very simple on the surface, but thoroughly rich and complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s very
      meditative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li: &lt;/strong&gt;Yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/01/drive-my-car-murakami-adaptation-film-review/621293/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: An electrifying adaptation of Murakami’s Drive My Car&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims:
      &lt;/strong&gt;When I was a teenager, I was in a bookstore and I picked up a book called &lt;em&gt;Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World&lt;/em&gt;, which is the first Murakami book I ever read. It’s still my sentimental favorite, even
      though I think he’s written better novels. When I was 15 years old, I was excited about a cool noir, sci-fi plot, but there’s a very early scene where a character in an elevator talks about the difference between understanding that the elevator is
      moving and not moving. Murakami has always been very good at framing this meditative space your brain can enter even in a mundane moment. And in &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt;, Kafuku’s resistant to having someone else drive his red Saab 900
      because clearly—like his wife does when they have sex in the early parts of the movie—he enters this kind of peaceful fugue state in the car. That’s where he is at his most balanced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so he’s not sure if he wants Misaki Watari to
      drive him around. But then—and it’s a scene I love; it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/01/drive-my-car-murakami-adaptation-film-review/621293/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the lede of my review&lt;/a&gt;—early on at dinner with
      the theater festival people, Kafuku is asked about her driving and he says, “I think it’s great. When she speeds up or slows down, it’s very smooth and doesn’t feel heavy at all. I sometimes forget that I’m even riding in a car. I’ve ridden cars
      driven by other people, but this is the first time it’s been this comfortable.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s the Murakami vibe! He’s saying it out loud! I went to the short story and tried to find that line, but it’s not in there. Hamaguchi just gets
      what is so important about that frame of mind. That’s what this character is craving and that’s why he forms this unspoken bond with Watari. Ah! This movie is so good!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s so good! I’ve watched it
      multiple times, and each time, new things jump out at me. There are so many little paths you can go down with this movie, all equally fascinating and rich. You could be talking about each of them for hours. One of the characters I found mesmerizing
      was Lee Yoon-a, the nonverbal actress cast in the [&lt;em&gt;Uncle Vanya&lt;/em&gt;] role of Sonya. She’s introduced during the audition phase and her scene almost brought me to tears. It’s fairly short, but the way she communicates with her body and
      with her eyes—you can see immediately why she was cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s a perfect example of what we’re talking about with language and how we can say things without the traditional modes of communication. I just feel like I could talk about
      this movie forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, there are little eddies you can explore every time you watch it. This movie is obviously smaller than &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; or whatever, but it is a movie that
      was given a shot during Omicron—a tough time for theatrical exhibition in general—and people went to see it. Critics and awards bodies highlighted it. Oscar voters paid attention. It’s a three-hour movie with subtitles. It seems like a tougher sell
      than it actually is. If people see it, they get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/09/haruki-murakami-translators-david-karashima-review/616210/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How Haruki Murakami’s
      translators shaped his early novels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love Murakami unreservedly. I know he’s got his faults, but he was big for me as a younger reader. But he is often like, “I smoked my 18th cigar and poured my 14th glass of Cutty
      Sark.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughs.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: “&lt;/strong&gt;I put on a sonata and fed my cats some sardines … And then I went to the kitchen to
      make some meal that sounds completely fabulous using whatever was in the cupboard … And then I reminisced on some insanely hot sex I had with someone.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li:
      &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;“… And then the phone rang and it was a secret agent!”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughs.&lt;/em&gt;) Like, he’s got his vibes. And this movie
      zeroes in on the particular melancholic aspects of Murakami. It’s a little less cool. I mean, it is cool, but no one owns a jazz club or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;I watched this film before I read the
      story. And if you’ve read Murakami, you know that when Misaki Watari’s character appears for the first time, he probably wrote something like “a very quiet and unassuming young woman” and probably described her in great physical detail. And indeed,
      the story is like, “She was a very plain and homely young lady.” And so there are some obvious Murakami elements to it, but I’m glad that Hamaguchi did not include the material in the first few pages of the short story where Kafuku expresses how he
      thinks women aren’t great at driving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, and the character is supposed to be won over by this female driver. I’m now thinking of other Murakami adaptations. I assume you’ve seen
      &lt;em&gt;Burning&lt;/em&gt;, which was a wonderful Korean film from a few years ago that’s also based on a short story. Almost everything is based on a short story. I’ve never seen the &lt;em&gt;Norwegian Wood&lt;/em&gt; annotation, which is his
      only novel I know of that’s been adapted. Murakami was not thrilled with that movie, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li: &lt;/strong&gt;He’s thrilled with this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, he likes
      &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li: &lt;/strong&gt;Yeah, he’s said that he likes this one. And Bong Joon Ho &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/02/movies/bong-joon-ho-ryusuke-hamaguchi-drive-my-car.html"&gt;also loves it&lt;/a&gt;. He said, “I would compare this to the sound of a bell that resonates for a long time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims:
      &lt;/strong&gt;Bong Joon Ho, who is of course the director of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/parasite-and-curse-closeness/600385/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Parasite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which won Best
      Picture a couple of years ago. And in terms of the Oscar conversation for this movie—and we talked about this a little bit on the&lt;em&gt; Power of the Dog&lt;/em&gt; episode, how the voting membership’s clearly changed—there have been efforts to
      diversify and young-ify the voting pool, which have reaped very interesting rewards. Do you think there’s a change in how audiences are approaching international film?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cruz: &lt;/strong&gt;The year after
      &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt;, when &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt; came out, the comparisons were made. It now feels like each year for the past few years, there’s a hot non-English-language Best Picture contender. And I’m grateful for that, if only for
      the fact that these movies are more in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/minari-and-the-invisible-stars-of-asian-led-movies/618169/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Minari and the invisible
      stars of Asian-led movies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li: &lt;/strong&gt;I largely feel the same way, Lenika. I think it’s great that there’s room at the Oscars for foreign-language films to be recognized. Sometimes we may be too hasty
      to see a film like &lt;em&gt;Parasite&lt;/em&gt; winning as a harbinger for everything being great from here on out though, you know? For last year’s Golden Globes, &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt; was only nominated for Foreign Language
      Film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Right, because the Golden Globes have a sort of annoying rule where if it counts as a Foreign Language Film, it doesn’t count as a drama or comedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li:
      &lt;/strong&gt;Right, and &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt; is also a deeply American story, so we saw there was a lot of &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/minari-and-the-invisible-stars-of-asian-led-movies/618169/?utm_source=feed"&gt;debate around that&lt;/a&gt;. I just think it’s great that there’s a space for foreign-language films to be
      recognized on this level, but I also don’t think they should only be seen as foreign-language films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sims: &lt;/strong&gt;Japan has one of the richest cinema histories of any country. And so it’s sort of shocking that
      this is the first Japanese film to get a Best Picture nomination. It’s great that the Oscars are expanding, but it does feel like there’s only space for a movie or two to break out in that way. It’s still baby steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just
      that this is a foreign-language film; it’s that this is a very quiet, very spare, three-hour emotional drama about feelings slowly being drawn out, car ride after car ride. The Oscars used to have some real middle-of-the-road tastes, and
      &lt;em&gt;Drive My Car&lt;/em&gt; is in the left lane, baby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Li: &lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky addressed a Joint Session of the U.S. Congress from his desk in Kyiv, bitter thoughts must have crossed his mind. Not so long ago, Donald Trump wouldn’t let Mike
      Pence attend the Ukrainian president’s inauguration. Zelensky spent the first year of his administration begging for an invitation to the White House that never arrived. While members of Congress greeted him rapturously, Zelensky put his hand over
      his heart, but he must have also thought to himself: &lt;i&gt;It would have been nice to have received this love a bit sooner&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelensky’s hovering visage presented a sharp contrast with the institution
      he was addressing. The Ukrainian president styles himself as a general defending democracy’s eastern front against the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/?utm_source=feed"&gt;onslaught of
      authoritarianism&lt;/a&gt;. This morning he wore a green military T-shirt. The U.S. members of Congress, in their suits and ties and dark blazers, reflected their sclerotic institution, constrained by antiquated rules, incapable of shoring up a
      democracy that’s beginning to crumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/volodymyr-zelensky-ukraine-president/622938/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Franklin Foer: A
      prayer for Volodymyr Zelensky &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That contrast is a reason for the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/zelensky-ukraine-president-jewish-hero/622945/?utm_source=feed"&gt;heroic
      status&lt;/a&gt; that Zelensky has achieved in the U.S. and Western Europe. With his rhetorical approach and personal style, he’s evinced something that Western publics crave deeply for themselves, a democratic example that’s badly missing. Through
      his wartime performance, he has demonstrated to countries that have slipped into rancor how to successfully deploy persuasion to build consensus without succumbing to accusation. Despite having every reason to hate Russians, he uses his videos to
      reason with them. The admiration for Zelensky that’s obvious and pervasive on social media is both genuine and a form of wish fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The telling moment in his congressional address came when he invoked—but never cited by
      name—Martin Luther King Jr.: “‘I have a dream.’ These words are known to each of you today. I can say I have a need. I need to protect our sky. I need your decision, your help, which means exactly the same. The same you feel when you hear the words
      ‘I have a dream.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a rhetorically bracing move—to attach the Ukrainian cause to the American struggle for racial equality. But by quoting that famous speech, Zelensky was laying his strategic cards on the table. He has run
      Ukraine’s wartime diplomacy as if it were a movement. Like any effective movement leader, he has tapped into a latent sense of idealism. When he declared, “I have a need”—the ultimate expression of self-interest—he was doing so on behalf of a cause
      greater than his own nation’s survival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And like any good movement tactician, he has pushed hard for big goals that he will never achieve, with the pragmatic hope of winning piecemeal victories. Having spent the past two weeks
      clamoring for NATO to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, he backed away from that demand ever so slightly in his congressional speech. He argued, “To create a no-fly zone over Ukraine to save people. Is this too much to ask? A humanitarian no-fly
      zone, something that Russia would not be able to terrorize our free cities. If this is too much to ask, we offer an alternative.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cleverness of that passage was its humility—“Is that too much to ask?” He seemed to acknowledge
      that his imperative to protect his people might not match the strategic interests of the nation he was addressing. By adding that rhetorical question, he wrapped his righteousness in self-awareness, which meant that he never conveyed ingratitude. It
      allowed him to pivot to request the next best alternative: the aircraft and air defenses that would help mitigate Russia’s superiority in the skies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again the contrast between Zelensky and his audience was sharp. Over the past year,
      crucial pieces of legislation (especially Build Back Better) have withered because politicians didn’t understand when they needed to settle for less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Zelensky took another unexpected turn. He proposed creating new global
      institutions to replace the inert postwar ones that have failed in the face of Russian aggression. Perhaps this proposal was a strategic gambit, setting up a negotiated settlement with Russia that will lean on some new international body to protect
      Ukraine’s security in lieu of NATO. But the passage had a haunting irony. The man who might not live to see the next week, who really just needs a few more airplanes to get through the day, is also the only global leader to have expressed a vision of
      what the future might look like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/volodymyr-zelensky-courage-ukraine-russia/622948/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What
      Zelensky’s courage says about the West&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he ended his speech, his last chance to extract help from the U.S., he returned to a familiar theme: mortality. “Now I’m almost 45 years old. Today, my age stopped
      when the hearts of more than 100 children stopped beating. I see no sense in life if it cannot stop the deaths.” By calling attention to his own age, however inadvertently, he was offering a final contrast to the politicians on the other end of the
      screen, the world’s most powerful gerontocracy. Resigned to his own death, he has become the mythical leader who has placed his people’s interests ahead of his own.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: Ben Affleck, resplendent with stubble and weary eye bags, is a rich but bored husband with a beautiful (but also bored) wife, rattling around in a giant house wondering what to do
      with himself. Soon enough, a dead body appears. That’s the premise of &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;, a sultry new thriller starring Affleck and Ana de Armas as his wayward partner, but I could just as easily be describing &lt;em&gt;Gone
      Girl&lt;/em&gt;, David Fincher’s superlative 2014 thriller about another Affleck-led relationship that goes sour. That tension is what the actor brings to the table these days: In any scene, you’re not sure whether you should kiss him or call the
      police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since the once–boyishly charming A-lister entered his 40s, he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/ben-affleck-and-way-back/607537/?utm_source=feed"&gt;leaned into&lt;/a&gt; roles that
      emphasize a haunted past without sacrificing his marquee-friendly looks. &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Adrian Lyne, is a healthy throwback to a previously dominant genre—the erotic drama. Lyne was once a master of the form, churning
      out hits such as &lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Indecent Proposal&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Unfaithful&lt;/em&gt; before &lt;a href="https://uproxx.com/hitfix/what-ever-happened-to-adrian-lyne/"&gt;seemingly retiring&lt;/a&gt; 20
      years ago. His return plays to his strengths, stringing together tasteful sex and murder-mystery material to create a perfectly dependable two hours of grown-up fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/ben-affleck-and-way-back/607537/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Ben Affleck gives the performance of his career&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because this is 2022, however, that grown-up
      fun has been relegated to a streaming service. (&lt;em&gt;Deep Water &lt;/em&gt;will debut on Hulu this Friday.) The film started shooting back in 2019, but its release was delayed time and again thanks to COVID; we’ve waited so long to see it,
      Affleck and de Armas even had an offscreen relationship that’s already run its course. Fox, &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;’s original studio, has now been subsumed under Disney, and the family-friendly House of Mouse has decided to keep the adult
      story out of cinemas. (Disney has not commented on this decision.) That’s a sad fate for &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;, given that it represents a comeback for a type of movie that used to pack houses. (&lt;em&gt;Fatal Attraction &lt;/em&gt;was one
      of the biggest hits of 1987.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, taking in all the steamy silliness from the comfort of your own home is enjoyable enough. In &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;, which is based on a 1957 Patricia Highsmith novel (itself a &lt;a
      href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-journal-book-club-gillian-flynn-on-patricia-highsmith-1398362234?tesla=y"&gt;cited inspiration&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;), Affleck plays Vic Van Allen, a retired microchip designer
      living in a fancy New Orleans mansion with his wife, Melinda (de Armas), and adorable daughter, Trixie (Grace Jenkins). Though the couple’s partnership is not without sexual spark, Melinda’s eye constantly wanders, and she fearlessly parades a series
      of men in front of her husband over the course of the film, canoodling with them at parties under his nose. Early in the movie, Vic takes Melinda’s latest squeeze aside and hints that he might have had a hand in the disappearance of her last supposed
      lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the comment a bit of jealous braggadocio, or is Vic actually a cold-blooded killer? That’s the keep-you-guessing appeal of &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;, which sees Vic and Melinda’s relationship vacillate between
      tenderness and simmering rage. In Highsmith’s novel, their marriage has entirely desiccated; Vic merely tolerates Melinda’s transgressions as long as she doesn’t ask for a messy divorce. But this update, written by Zach Helm and Sam Levinson, is a
      lot less clear on how officially “open” the couple are, and whether Melinda’s affairs are an attempt to catch her husband’s attention or push him away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Affleck is therefore well cast; he can play Vic as a piece of dead weight while
      still winking at the movie-star magnetism that lurks underneath, teasing it out as the story develops. The role is far darker (and pulpier) than the one he played in the inspirational drama &lt;em&gt;The Way Back&lt;/em&gt;, but whereas in that film
      he portrayed an alcoholic rediscovering his love of basketball, here his character’s true passion leads to a lot of suspicious disappearances. Once Vic makes his veiled threat to Melinda’s boy toy, he starts upping the menacing behavior around each
      subsequent lover (played by Jacob Elordi and Finn Wittrock, among others).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt='Ana de Armas gazing into the distance while sitting on a staircase in "Deep Water"' height="374"

      young stars around right now—&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/11/the-unlikely-hero-of-rian-johnsons-knives-out/602701/?utm_source=feed"&gt;her &lt;em&gt;Knives Out &lt;/em&gt;performance was revelatory&lt;/a&gt;, and
      she was the best thing about &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/no-time-to-die-review-james-bond/620299/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year. But she gets the short stick here,
      mostly glowering in the background as Melinda ponders whether Vic has turned as villainous as he’s intimating. Their scenes together have genuine sizzle, something many a modern Hollywood romance lacks. But &lt;em&gt;Deep Water &lt;/em&gt;could use a
      little more shading for its female lead, especially some further explanation of just how her relationship with Vic deteriorated. Instead, audiences are served up multiple moments of Vic communing with snails, which he keeps as pets (a reference to
      Highsmith herself, who &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/may/21/a-half-shaven-head-a-handbag-of-snails-at-a-cocktail-party-i-just-adore-a-true-eccentric-hannah-jane-parkinson"&gt;apparently&lt;/a&gt; once pulled gastropods out
      of her handbag at a dinner party).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in good whodunits, the setup is typically way more exciting than the payoff: For example, the first two-thirds of &lt;em&gt;Unfaithful&lt;/em&gt;, Lyne’s previous film, are alluring and
      skillfully performed, while the final act feels more perfunctory. In &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt;, viewers will have much more fun guessing at how dangerous Vic and Melinda’s cat-and-mouse game is going to get than watching the results unfold.
      Characters start making mistakes, the body count reaches implausible levels, and practical questions of just &lt;em&gt;who &lt;/em&gt;is keeping an eye on Vic and Melinda’s daughter during all this mayhem start to overwhelm the narrative. But
      &lt;em&gt;Deep Water&lt;/em&gt; is still a robust, well-acted thriller that lands most of its major twists gracefully; for that, all lesser sins can be forgiven.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do we ever really understand our parents? Certainly not when we’re children. If we’re lucky, we begin to understand them later. We might one day realize, for example, that they carried burdens we couldn’t see. Sometimes
      I wonder if I might have learned something important about what was to come in adulthood had I been paying closer attention when I was little, but no, I couldn’t have related then. It is only in recent years, when the most maddening, haunting fact of
      parenting has become clear to me, that I’ve realized my mom and dad must have known it all along: What parents want most of all—to keep our children safe forever––is the one thing that’s absolutely impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure

      ago. I was making lunch in my kitchen for myself, my husband, and our adolescent son and daughter. We were in the phase of life where our children were beginning to turn into adults, time ticking by as one teenager prepared to leave the nest after
      the other. As their lives grew busier with each passing year, I saw less and less of them. They were moving further out from under my wing, and I felt proud of them at the same time that I had a primal urge to swallow them whole, absorb them right
      back into my body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I sliced cabbage into ribbons for slaw, Dad told me about my mother’s garden project and a sci-fi movie he wanted to go see. Just as I was about to say goodbye, he asked if I’d heard about a new book by Garrett
      M. Graff. “It’s called &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781476735429"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raven Rock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a

      book. It was the true story of the secret underground bunkers the U.S. maintained for decades starting in the 20th century, intended to house and protect high-ranking government officials in the event of a nuclear attack. The book’s subtitle says it
      all: “The Story of the U.S. Government’s Secret Plan to Save Itself—While the Rest of Us Die.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My dad’s bedside table is typically stacked with paperback novels about what the world would be like if the planet were ruled by Russian
      robots or if America had been taken over by zombies. So when he asked if I’d order him this book about hidden subterranean government control centers, I said, “Sure, Dad. Sounds right up your alley.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It reminds me of when I worked
      there,” he replied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Worked where?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“... there?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, at Site R—at Raven Rock.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, of course. There. The secret underground bunker he had never
      mentioned to me once in my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You think you know somebody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reviewed what I knew—or what I thought I knew—about my father’s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Vietnam, my
      father was in medical school as well as the Army Reserve. While on a rotation in Hawaii, where he and my mother lived briefly before I was born, his responsibilities included treating soldiers and their families; across the ocean in the battle-bloody
      jungle, many of his peers were fighting. Born at the dawn of the Cold War, educated in the “duck and cover” years of hiding under classroom desks during bomb drills, he had never imagined war as some kind of vague, far-off possibility. He knew the
      truth, that whether it is happening here at home or on a continent far enough away to seem “foreign” to those who wish to distance themselves from it, conflict is raging somewhere at any given time. War is always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/virus-and-blitz/608965/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How to survive the blitz&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dad stayed in the army
      for a few more years after he and my mom left Hawaii, while he continued his specialized medical training. He went on to become a renowned surgeon, moving our family from city to city after I was born, dedicating his life to intellectual challenge
      and scientific innovation. In the operating room, he used cutting-edge equipment to restore people’s hearing and relieve patients of pain. He often traveled the world to share expertise in his highly specialized field of neurotology. When he couldn’t
      find the exact tools he wanted for performing microsurgery inside people’s ears, he invented them. He often prowled Home Depot for tidbits of metal and plastic, screws and hinges, then put them together and took them apart again in his basement
      workshop, creating prototypes for things he’d like to make on a smaller scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, I knew we had lived near the nation’s capital during the Bicentennial celebration of 1976, not because I remembered it—I was barely more than
      a baby—but because I’d seen pictures of my toddler self walking around the parade grounds waving a little American flag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it really possible that I had no idea what my dad had been doing when I was young?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It
      wasn’t as if our family stopped doing regular things while my father was doing this not-at-all-regular job. I went to nursery school. We planted a garden, and I stepped on a bee. We found a baby bird and tried to feed it in a shoe box and buried it
      when it died. I found a roll of cinnamon breath mints and ate the whole thing and for one long afternoon thought I could breathe fire. These are the things I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary doesn’t wipe out the ordinary. People get
      married in wartime. Babies are born during pandemics. My mom drew water for my bath and flung wet clothes into the dryer and taught me to tie my shoes while my father did test runs for the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr
      class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After my dad casually dropped this news, I pressed for some details. “But what exactly were you doing when we lived outside D.C.?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He explained that he had been a general medical officer
      stationed at the Fort Ritchie health clinic. He and some other officers were assigned the job of going to Camp David for routine tasks such as giving flu shots to the company of Marines stationed there. My dad was not the physician to President
      Gerald Ford—he was far too young then—but he was at Camp David sometimes when Ford visited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What about Raven Rock?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We called it ‘Site R.’ My army corpsman, George, and I would go over fairly frequently
      to check on things. Sometimes we’d take the Oldsmobile ambulance to the helipad when the secretary of defense came up. Good thing the helicopter never crashed.” He chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“But the thing with the drills, what did you
      practice?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We practiced the plan.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I know, but … what was the plan?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Well, the plan was, George and I would get over there fast to open up the hospital and hope the rest of the team would get
      there soon. I suppose we were there to keep people alive—the people who would run the country and the military in the event of a disaster.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/a-uniquely-perilous-moment/627040/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: This is a uniquely perilous moment&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Oh my God, Dad. How did you feel about all
      that?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Dazzled, at first! Then kind of bored. We were never put to use, thank goodness.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I asked if the existential weight of it ever got to him. He handed the phone to my mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every now and
      then … off he would go into the cave, and there we would sit at home,” she said. “I didn’t feel like we were in any real danger of having a nuclear attack—it was just drills. But every now and then I would look at you and think, &lt;em&gt;Well, what
      are we? Lunch meat?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graff’s book—which I bought and read after this conversation—includes a scene in which President Ford’s press secretary, Ron Nessen, tours one of the secret bunkers in 1976:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The
      last line of his evacuation instructions had been clear: ‘There are no provisions for families at the relocation or assembly sites.’ Would he have really abandoned all of his family in the country’s hour of need?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What a
      question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Was it strange for my father? To descend below the surface of the Earth, to go through the motions of what he would do if the president were rushed into an underground hospital while, above ground, human life ceased? Did
      he walk out of our house in the morning as I ate my toaster waffle imagining that if this thing he practiced ever came to be, he would one day walk out of this house and never walk in again? That my mother, our house, my baby brother, and I would all
      be blasted into hot dust?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wondered whether my dad ever thought the whole exercise was pointless. If humanity has nuked itself into oblivion and there’s no safe world left to return to above ground, it’s not like hunkering down in
      a man-made fallout fortress will be any more effective than ducking and covering beneath a desk. The end still awaits whenever they open up that chamber, meaning that no one is really saved, only temporarily protected. Getting ready for an atomic
      bomb to fall doesn’t predict or influence whether the bomb will fall. It’s all pretend, just busywork, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is a bomb shelter but either practice for something that will never happen or a postponement of the
      inevitable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was in college—oh, this is one of my favorite Dad stories—he used to send the most bizarre care packages. Other kids received Tupperware containers full of homemade brownies,
      maybe a pair of mittens or an envelope of cash if they were lucky. That’s what I got, too, if my mom was packing the box. But the packages from my dad almost never included a note and always contained canned food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a strange
      delight, toting those boxes across campus from the post office, knowing from their heft that they were filled with nonperishable items for a pantry I didn’t have. It became a joke between my roommate and me. What would my dad send next––Vienna
      sausages, canned pineapple? Did he think I didn’t have access to food at school? That my dorm-mates and I might be building some sort of survival stockpile? We giggled every time one arrived—honest to God, we sometimes joked, “Here we go, another
      bomb-shelter box”—and stacked the cans under our beds. We ate the food, but not as fast as it accumulated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How strange,&lt;/em&gt; I thought then, but also &lt;em&gt;how sweet.&lt;/em&gt; My quirky dad, showing love via
      canned goods, of all things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am about 20 years older today than my father was when he worked in the bunker. My son left for college last fall. In two years, my daughter will leave home as well.
      I realize now that their leaving does not conclude my parenting, at least not in my heart. I will never stop worrying about them. I feel as if I’ve been walking around for decades now wearing an invisible explosive vest. The longer I live, the more I
      love, the larger this combustible bundle grows, the more I am in awe of my good fortune—and also aware that it could all blow up in an instant, flipping me head over heels into the air, vaporizing everything. Sometimes it almost knocks me down, this
      combination of gratitude and fear. I often feel like the universe entrusted me with so much more than I could possibly keep safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t understand when I opened those care packages in college. I do now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although
      the worst-case scenario my dad prepared for didn’t come to pass then, other horrors have over the years––and still do. My heart breaks for parents in Ukraine today, putting their children on trains with strangers to travel over a border to safety,
      watching their teenagers arm themselves to enter combat for which they haven’t been adequately trained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether in a hypothetical nuclear attack, in the brutal reality of ongoing war, or in the simple, mundane truth of being a
      living soul trapped in a mortal human body, it is a fact: We cannot really save anyone. Not permanently. The safeguards we set up all fall away. In the best-case scenario, our babies grow up healthy and strong under our watch, then leave to set out
      on their own. Worst case, our attempts to protect our loved ones fail, and they are felled by something we could not stop. Knowing this––as my parents surely did during the bunker years, and as I do now as a mother––could drive us
      mad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do we do, then, if we cannot stop time or prevent every loss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We carry on with ordinary acts of everyday caretaking. I cannot shield my beloveds forever, but I can make them lunch today. I can teach a
      teenager to drive. I can take someone to a doctor appointment, fix the big crack in the ceiling when it begins to leak, and tuck everyone in at night until I can’t anymore. I can do small acts of nurturing that stand in for big, impossible acts of
      permanent protection, because the closest thing to lasting shelter we can offer one another is love, as deep and wide and in as many forms as we can give it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take care of who we can and what we can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount
      of time that elapsed between my 2-year-old self toddling along the National Mall waving a flag and my 18-year-old self moving into a dorm feels vast in my memory. But I understand now that those years didn’t feel long to my father. Between the days
      when the siren called him down into the bunker and the days when he started packing boxes full of shelf-stable food to send to his baby, hardly any time passed at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;​​When you buy a book using a

    <id>tag:theatlantic.com,2022:50-627074</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crude oil, the world’s most important and ubiquitous commodity, is weird. It is weird both as a physical object and as a phenomenon that underpins the world economy. Every day, humanity sticks steel tubes several miles
      underground and sucks out magic rock juice, which is made of dead ocean bugs. After prospectors discovered petroleum in Titusville, Pennsylvania, in 1859, igniting the world’s first oil rush, northerners wondered whether petroleum was America’s
      divine reward for upholding “liberty and law” in the Civil War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even today, certain facts about oil can instill a sense of divine awe. Each gallon of gasoline comprises 98 metric tons of ancient sea life, compressed by geology and
      chemistry into a liquid that can propel a 2,000-pound car the distance that a man could walk in a day. Burning that gallon of gasoline also releases 20 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, where it will eventually warm the climate and
      acidify the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil market is weird too. Most of the time, the world doesn’t need to think about the pipelines, tankers, and on-land storage tanks that ferry oil around the world and allow for something like a spot market for
      it. Yet Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has brought the system to the fore. Over the past two weeks, the global oil benchmark has jumped to nearly $130 a barrel, only to fall below $100 today. Even though the United States imports relatively little
      Russian oil, domestic gasoline prices have surged. The global oil system has been disturbed enough that one of its central elisions is now of material effect to just about everyone in America. Because even though oil has a global price, oil is not
      really one &lt;i&gt;thing &lt;/i&gt;at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we call petroleum is actually more a general category of chemicals than a single substance. All oil falls along two axes. First, oil can be &lt;i&gt;sour &lt;/i&gt;or
      &lt;i&gt;sweet&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;a range that indicates how much sulfur is in the crude.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;Sour oil has a lot of sulfur; sweet&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; very little. Sulfur causes particularly nasty forms of pollution—when
      burned, it forms &lt;a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air/sulfur-dioxide-so2#:~:text=Sulfur%20dioxide%20(SO2)%2C%20a,other%20materials%20that%20contain%20sulfur."&gt;sulfur dioxide&lt;/a&gt;, which causes heart and lung problems, generates smog,
      and produces acid rain—so sour crudes need more refining and processing before they can become usable products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, oil can be &lt;i&gt;heavy &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;light&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;a trait called its
      “density.” This describes something more fundamental. Crude oil is a mix of hydrogen and carbon atoms bound together in chains. When a crude is heavy,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;those chains are long and enormous, giving the consistency of window putty or
      caulk. In a light crude, the chains are short and small, making the oil more like water. At the lightest end of this range, you’re left with a hydrocarbon so airy that it’s not liquid at all: the gas &lt;a
      href="https://scied.ucar.edu/learning-zone/how-climate-works/methane#:~:text=Methane%20is%20gas%20that%20is,is%20a%20powerful%20greenhouse%20gas."&gt;methane&lt;/a&gt;, just four hydrogen atoms bound to a carbon atom. Methane is the main hydrocarbon
      in natural gas. “Oil and gas are functionally the same thing—just varying different densities of hydrocarbon,” Rory Johnston, an oil-market analyst and the founder of the newsletter &lt;a href="https://commoditycontext.substack.com/"&gt;Commodity
      Context&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The petroleum products that we use to fuel cars, trucks, and planes also vary in density. Gasoline has shorter chains than diesel, which, in turn, has shorter chains than bunker fuel,
      the gunky sludge used to power cargo ships. Yet a heavy petroleum can still produce a light fuel. “With the right chemistry and equipment, you can convert that kind of stuff into something more like gasoline by just really cracking at it a while,”
      Johnston told me. That’s what a refinery does: hit longer chains of hydrocarbons with heat and chemicals over and over until they split into something more usable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot of all this is that heavy, sour crudes can fetch less
      money on the global market than lighter or sweeter crudes because they require more refining and processing to be turned into something economically useful. In December, the United States imported 405,000 barrels of petroleum and other oil products
      from Russia. More than half of these imports were classified as “unfinished oils” by the federal government. But in the industry, Johnston said, people use a different name for these barrels: “Russian sludge.” Those Russian fuels are some of the
      heaviest and most sour crudes in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is why, counterintuitively, the United States imports so much of them—and why replacing them is not entirely a matter of matching the volume lost to sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In
      the late 2000s, oil and gas companies expected that the United States would soon need to start importing much more oil and gas than it had needed historically. It would have to process cheap, dirty crudes—such as those drilled from the tar sands of
      western Canada—in huge volumes in order to satisfy its needs. The Gulf Coast had then, and still has, the largest fleet of oil refineries in the world, and firms began preparing these refineries for decades of heavy, sludgy imports. Today, America’s
      129 refineries excel at converting heavy, sulfur-ridden fuels into usable mid-grade fuels such as diesel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is kind of funny, because the forecast that justified their construction—that the U.S. would eventually depend on cheap
      crude oil from abroad—proved false. By the late 2000s, American engineers had learned to unlock the oil hidden deep beneath the surface using a technique called “hydrofracturing,” or fracking. These companies flooded the market with the biggest
      year-over-year increase in oil supply in history, Johnston said. And in a fitting punch line to aughts-era anxieties, shale produced some of the world’s sweetest, lightest crude. The refineries had invested tens of billions of dollars in processing
      heavy, sour crudes for a future that never arrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or … that never arrived &lt;i&gt;quite&lt;/i&gt; as they had imagined. Today, many Gulf Coast energy companies feed their refineries a financially optimized mix of sweet, light
      crudes and heavy, sour crudes, Johnston said. These produce a range of refined products—gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, bunker fuel—more cheaply than light shale oil would alone, Johnston said. With Russian-oil imports now banned, those refiners may have
      to run a less optimal mix of crude imports than they might like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s partly why the United States has begun tiptoeing toward importing oil from Venezuela, which produces a dirty, sour crude much like Russia’s. But the more
      important reason is that Venezuela—and Iran, which the Biden administration would also like to bring back on the market—has &lt;i&gt;barrels of oil&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;The world was once projected to burn 100 million barrels of oil a day in
      2022. Losing Russia cuts out 10 percent of those barrels, and even if Iran and Venezuela both sold oil again on the global market, they would make up less than half of Russia’s total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russia sanctions could also affect the
      global oil market for years to come. For now, the cargo on most Russian oil tankers was bought and sold before the war began, Johnston said. But if the country struggles to find a buyer for its oil, then it will still try to produce as long as
      possible, gradually filling up its tanker fleet and onshore storage. Only then would it consider shutting off production at some wells, Johnston said. But that carries risk for the country’s status as a producer, because “shutting in” wells damages
      their long-term ability to produce: It’s not easy, in other words, to turn a well off and on without permanently hurting it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Russia has to take the unprecedented step of shutting off its wells, then it may never recover their
      full production capacity. And given the number of Western oil companies that have withdrawn from the country completely, it may lack the know-how and investment needed to turn them back on, even if sanctions eventually do recede, Johnston said. In
      other words, even if gas prices fall in the short term, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/02/why-gas-got-so-expensive/622887/?utm_source=feed"&gt;they may be destined to rise for years to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The hunt for the next big, bad coronavirus variant is on. Scientists around the world are sampling wastewater and amassing nose swabs from the sick; they’re &lt;a
      href="https://www.ft.com/content/bdb5e0ff-65fc-4dd7-a7bc-7fe2510476de"&gt;scouring the microbe’s genetic code&lt;/a&gt; for alarming aberrations. The world of outbreak surveillance “is all virus,” says Danny Douek, an immunologist at the National
      Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. We’re laser-focused on getting eyes on &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/03/massive-global-hunt-variants-under-way/618230/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a variant that would be
      well-equipped to wallop us&lt;/a&gt;, then alerting the globe. But that, Douek told me, is just one half of the infectious playing field where offense and defense meet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The powers of pathogens change over time; so
      do those of the molecules and cells that our bodies use to fight them, including &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/waning-immunity-not-all-bad/620436/?utm_source=feed"&gt;antibodies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/t-cells-omicron-vaccine-immunity/620995/?utm_source=feed"&gt;T cells&lt;/a&gt;. Preparedness, Douek said, means keeping good tabs on both. So in the same way we survey viruses to see how
      they’re evolving over time, we might do well to canvass &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt; too.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Monitoring the status of our anti-disease protection would amount to a kind of &lt;a
      href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC8741221/"&gt;immune surveillance&lt;/a&gt; that could tell us “when immunity wanes, and when it needs to be augmented,” says John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. One
      obvious spot to start is with mass antibody testing, or serology, to figure out how drastically and quickly antibody levels are changing over time, and in whom. We could get a rough sense of which members of the population might be most susceptible
      in the event of another surge and prioritize them for boosters, tests, treatments, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/new-covid-variant-mitigation/626980/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The coronavirus’s next move&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The notion of using antibody data to
      identify vulnerable people (and ideal vaccination candidates) in a population &lt;a
      href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-infection/article/predicting-the-impact-of-measles-vaccination-in-england-and-wales-model-validation-and-analysis-of-policy-options/37019829C56F77FD4BBB1AF246480402"&gt;isn’t
      new&lt;/a&gt;. But regularly taking those sorts of samples on a massive scale, over long periods of time, “has never been done,” Anisha Misra, a clinical microbiologist at Mayo Clinic, told me. Building such a system would require massive federal
      investment and a huge infrastructural overhaul. “This is much harder than virologic surveillance,” Richard Webby, a flu virologist at St. Jude Children’s Hospital, in Memphis, told me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its most powerful,
      though, a strategy like this could act as an immunological fuel gauge, sounding the alarm before our antibody tanks run dry. The alternative is simply waiting for immunized people to catch a virus, and maybe even get seriously sick, &lt;em&gt;then
      &lt;/em&gt;revaccinating to fill in the defensive gaps. Although “it’s natural to just measure the cases” as they’re happening, that reactive approach can get us only so far, Jessica Metcalf, a disease ecologist at Princeton, told me. &lt;a
      href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/58989"&gt;Figuring out who’s vulnerable in advance&lt;/a&gt; could pinpoint the cracks in our shields before the virus exploits them. It could minimize the number of people who have to fall ill at
      all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr class="c-section-divider"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tech to manage this feat is already in hand. Even now, researchers can assess antibody levels through blood that’s collected via the prick of a finger—a procedure that some tests (not the
      Theranos kind) even allow folks to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33588354/"&gt;do at home&lt;/a&gt;. Wherry envisions collecting those samples every few months or so, whether at routine checkups or through a public-health campaign.
      Those community specimens could be supplemented with &lt;a href="https://www.covidroadmap.org/"&gt;samples from blood banks&lt;/a&gt;. The goal would be to track antibodies by two metrics, Douek told me: durability, or the length of time that the
      molecules’ levels stay acceptably high, and breadth, or the degree to which they zap different variants. A shortfall in either might prompt revaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/serology-surveillance/index.html"&gt;CDC&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a
      href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19latestinsights/antibodies"&gt;equivalent agencies abroad&lt;/a&gt;, have built up systems to scope out antibodies in the
      community before, including during the coronavirus pandemic. But those surveys have primarily used antibodies as a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/misuing-antibody-tests/617981/?utm_source=feed"&gt;proxy for past
      infection&lt;/a&gt;. Using antibodies alone to denote &lt;em&gt;immunity &lt;/em&gt;is a lot more fraught: Being chock-full of them is no guarantee of protection, in the same way that being somewhat low on them does not necessarily spell
      doom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/how-many-covid-19-booster-shots/621132/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Our relationship with COVID
      vaccines is just getting started&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what antibody levels &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/07/correlates-of-protection-vaccine-immunity/619508/?utm_source=feed"&gt;correspond to protection&lt;/a&gt; against infection or disease from SARS-CoV-2 would help. When we’ve found these
      so-called correlates of protection for other viruses, they’ve become über useful. They can tell us when people &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/rubella/pregnancy.html"&gt;hoping to get pregnant&lt;/a&gt; should nab a &lt;a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pregnancy/vacc-safety.html"&gt;rubella shot&lt;/a&gt;, or when health-care workers low on &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/adults/rec-vac/hcw.html"&gt;hepatitis B antibodies&lt;/a&gt; should sign up for a
      booster, Elitza Theel, a serology expert at Mayo Clinic, told me. With the new coronavirus, we’re close to a consensus on some correlates—in “a nice ballpark,” says Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale. We could imagine a future in which we call
      for boosters when, say, half the population drops below a defined threshold. But we &lt;a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jcm.00482-21"&gt;haven’t yet nailed the inflection point between &lt;em&gt;protected &lt;/em&gt;and
      &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even when we understand those numbers with more precision, we will face a tough decision: which correlate of protection to select as a booster cutoff. The
      number of antibodies necessary to stave off severe disease will be far lower than the number needed to block transmission, much less &lt;em&gt;any infection at all.&lt;/em&gt; “We need to ask what we are trying to achieve here,” says Marc-André
      Langlois, a molecular virologist at the University of Ottawa. A campaign geared toward maintaining sky-high, infection-blocking levels of antibodies, for instance, could require tons and tons of shots at an unsustainable clip.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antibodies are also finicky and super specific—ones that latch on tightly to one version of the virus might &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/covid-boosters-omicron-effective/620883/?utm_source=feed"&gt;bounce uselessly off of another&lt;/a&gt;. Which means a level of antibody that’s sufficient to guard against, say, a variant such
      as Omicron, “will most likely not apply to the next one,” Langlois told me. If we had just one SARS-CoV-2 flavor, the correlates conversation would probably be done, Theel said. As things stand, though, the virus presents “a moving target.” This is
      why breadth of protection matters: If &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/new-covid-variant-mitigation/626980/?utm_source=feed"&gt;an antibody-dodging version of SARS-CoV-2&lt;/a&gt; rears its head, &lt;em&gt;everyone
      &lt;/em&gt;might need another round of doses, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/02/covid-vaccine-new-variants/622903/?utm_source=feed"&gt;perhaps reformulated&lt;/a&gt; to account for the new variant’s quirks.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/vaccinate-old/622080/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The COVID strategy America hasn’t really
      tried&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make things all the messier: Correlates can even differ between groups of &lt;em&gt;people, &lt;/em&gt;based on age, immune-system health, or possibly even vaccine brand, infection
      history, and exposure conditions; some researchers still wonder if antibodies, as opposed to another immune defender such as T cells, will be the correct way to measure SARS-CoV-2’s correlates at all. (That’s part of why &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/02/misuing-antibody-tests/617981/?utm_source=feed"&gt;using antibody tests to measure immunity on an &lt;em&gt;individual &lt;/em&gt;basis&lt;/a&gt;, as a means to guide behavior, remains
      dangerous; &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/antibody-testing-not-currently-recommended-assess-immunity-after-covid-19-vaccination-fda-safety"&gt;the FDA advises against it&lt;/a&gt;.) Which is to say, we don’t get
      SARS-CoV-2 immunity anywhere near as well as we could, and hopefully someday will. But maybe ultra-precise correlates of protection don’t have to make or break a program like this. While we’re still finagling those values, immune surveillance could
      still be valuable for sussing out antibody &lt;em&gt;dynamics &lt;/em&gt;among subsets of the population, said Douek, who, together with colleagues at NIAID, is launching a &lt;a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/premise"&gt;new
      initiative&lt;/a&gt;, focused on immune surveillance for a bevy of pathogens, that he hopes will prep us for the next pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, all we really need to know is that antibody levels are dropping
      &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;. Certain individuals, including &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/vaccine-second-booster-shot-seniors/627069/?utm_source=feed"&gt;the elderly&lt;/a&gt;, will inevitably experience speedier
      downticks than others; those are the people we’d want to &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/ofid/article/9/2/ofab632/6481744"&gt;prioritize for revaccination&lt;/a&gt; should a new wave of cases start to rise. Immune surveillance could also reveal
      still-unknown variables that might be tugging antibody numbers down. Tracking these sorts of trends could flash an additional warning if the virus reshapes itself or resurges: “If you’re seeing a rapid decline in antibody, and an increase in the
      virus in wastewater,” Wherry said, that’s a clear trigger to roll out vaccines anew for anyone whose levels are low. Keeping a close eye on community antibody levels could also tell us &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/12/how-many-covid-19-booster-shots/621132/?utm_source=feed"&gt;who &lt;em&gt;doesn’t &lt;/em&gt;yet need to boost&lt;/a&gt; because their defenses remain comfortably high. In those folks, “&lt;a
      href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.20.481163v1"&gt;boosting may have minimal benefit&lt;/a&gt;,” Wherry told me—an equally important message to send to the public when resources are scarce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/vaccine-second-booster-shot-seniors/627069/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How to time your second
      booster&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accumulating and storing these samples on a regular basis would also bolster the sorts of viral surveillance that many other scientists already want to be doing. When a highly mutated
      variant starts to spread, scientists must scramble to figure out if the antibodies raised by current vaccines can block it, using serology samples from immunized people. The system we have in place to update our flu vaccines annually, run by the
      World Health Organization, relies on just “a few hundred samples” collected from around the globe each year, Webby, of St. Jude, told me. With COVID, a more expansive repository, representing a much more diverse swath of the population, could give
      researchers and policy makers a more granular view of population risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re still figuring out which factors will most often push us to vaccinate again. Maybe the virus will mutate so quickly that we’ll need a
      reformulated shot every year. Or perhaps its evolution will slow, and plunges in antibody levels will dictate our boosts. Paying attention to both could help strike the right balance. We can’t just “wait for the next variant” before we decide to act,
      Iwasaki told me. The more we monitor our defenses, the better we can maintain them, and the tougher it will be for the virus to roar back again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to believe, but the humble index—expediter of searches, organizer of concepts— prompted outcries as it became more widespread: If one has an index, why would anyone read a book? Alarms “were being sounded,”
      Dennis Duncan writes in his lively &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781324002543"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Index, A History of the&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “that indexes were &lt;i&gt;taking the place&lt;/i&gt; of books.” Jonathan Swift worried that people
      would “pretend to understand a Book, by scouting thro’ the Index, as if a Traveller should go about to describe a Palace, when he has seen nothing but the Privy.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I confess to spending an undue amount of time in the Palace Privy—and
      loving it. Done well, an index, that list in the back of a book containing its concepts and references, is either hugely helpful, sending you directly to the mentions of, say, Theodore Roosevelt’s dog Pete attacking the French ambassador, when you
      don’t want to read the whole biography. Or it is eclectic and opinionated, clever and winking. It is a side door into the book: less formal, more personal than the route through copyright and title pages, tables of contents and dedications. It
      enables a kind of choose-your-own-adventure for the literary. You race right to the spots you want, and take your own tour through the author’s words. Indexes offer the reader multiple ways in and through the text, freeing them from the confines of
      an ineluctable narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a reader and you don’t like indexes, you may have run across only poor ones. The pleasure I take in a book is determined not just by its main pages, the words carefully written by the author, but
      also by its adjunct elements, its dressing: the index, but also the dust jacket, the author bio, the dedication and acknowledgments, the typeface note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can track my own biography through these paratexts. In college, I coveted and
      collected well-turned footnotes, such as “You have a donkey, so have I …” from J. L. Austin’s essay “A Plea for Excuses” and Nicholson Baker’s “Perforation! Shout it out!” in his &lt;i&gt;The Mezzanine&lt;/i&gt;. Professionally, my fascination with
      the guide words at the top of each page of a dictionary, indicating its alphabetical range of words, led me to become a reader of dictionaries and, subsequently, hired by one. I was tasked with amending the previous version of the dictionary to
      reflect changing word usage, including adding new meanings and new entries. My days were punctuated by each fresh new box of words—3x5 cards with examples of their use in writing. The labels on the boxes were themselves poetry, and so I defined
      “downhearted to dragon lady,” “mind-boggling to miniature schnauzer,” “skimble-skamble to skit.” Years later, as a fact-checker at &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;, pre–Google search, we relied on the gloriously exhaustive volumes of the annual
      &lt;i&gt;New York Times Index&lt;/i&gt; (lauded in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt; as “unique … indispensable … amazingly complete”) to track down sundry facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/06/information-efficiency-history-filing-cabinet/619106/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The logic of the filing cabinet is everywhere&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moment I felt I had
      arrived as a writer was after finding my father’s name in the &lt;i&gt;Times Index&lt;/i&gt; (“1975, Horowitz, Jay, O 15, 46:2”) and then discovering my own—“Horowitz, Alexandra, 10, 101”—in another writer’s book. I feel that I’ve launched on a
      writing project only when I’ve begun compiling indexlike documents on subject topics—“&lt;i&gt;on the inside of your own eye&lt;/i&gt;,” “&lt;i&gt;on street-crossing instructions&lt;/i&gt;,” “&lt;i&gt;on running after one’s hat&lt;/i&gt;”—which
      themselves index the research I have read relating to the topic. After the manuscript is completed comes a thrilling day when I am sent my own book’s index—the person who compiles it is the first reader who isn’t invested in the book. The topics she
      pulls out, how she cuts the conceptual lines, are more than a concordance of words; they are her interpretation of the landscape of ideas in the book. The index reifies it &lt;i&gt;as &lt;/i&gt;a book, at the same time that the choice to foreground
      one topic or another might surprise even the author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I was reminded, reading Duncan’s paean to them, just how whimsical indexes can be.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;By far the highlight of Lewis Carroll’s widely (and perhaps rightly)
      overlooked &lt;i&gt;Sylvie and Bruno&lt;/i&gt; is the index (“Bread-sauce. What appropriate for? 58” and “Crocodiles, logic of; 230” are favorites). &lt;i&gt;Lemony Snicket: The Unauthorized Autobiography&lt;/i&gt; neatly sums itself up, indexly:
      “doom, overall feeling of, ix-211.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, in reading Duncan’s book, I began with the index. Such a book might have a quite self-conscious one, you’d think. Although the indexer, Paula Clarke Bain, is credited within the
      main body of the text (and self-indexed in the index), her name, like most who do her job, is not on the dust jacket with the author’s. But Bain’s playful, completely over-the-top index demonstrates how authorial the indexer’s presence is, leading
      the reader on wild-goose chases (“wild goose chase&lt;i&gt; see &lt;/i&gt;chase, wild goose”; “goose chase, wild &lt;i&gt;see &lt;/i&gt;wild-goose chase”), pointing out elements of the text that a reader might have missed, and commenting on Duncan’s
      description of her own task as “drudgery.” (Bain replies, “How dare you.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samuel Johnson used similar language—&lt;i&gt;harmless drudge&lt;/i&gt;—to describe the lexicographer who compiles a dictionary. As Duncan observes, indexes
      have a long history of being anything but “harmless,” which is what gives them the possibility of such personality. Indexes have been wielded to display wit, to skewer an author (“his egregious dulness”; “his Pedantry”; “his familiar acquaintance
      with Books that he never saw”), and as a site of political battling (as when a Whig indexed a Tory &lt;em&gt;History of England&lt;/em&gt;). Tasked with writing an introduction to an 18th-century sentimental novel, Henry Morley concocted an “Index to
      Tears,” enumerating all the instances of sobbing, flowing tears, and weeping in the emotionally overwrought tale. “A highly satisfying take-down,” Duncan writes. Duncan’s indexer comments on this episode via a winding set of cross-references
      (“blubbing &lt;i&gt;see &lt;/i&gt;crying”; “crying &lt;i&gt;see &lt;/i&gt;howling”; etc.) ending, finally, at a central title of the index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In giving the index its biography, Duncan rightly celebrates the paratexts—the peripheral
      ephemera—that transmogrify an author’s work from a Microsoft Word doc into a pleasing object on the shelf of your local bookshop. The history of indexes, as Duncan tells it, is also a history of alphabetical order, chaptering, and the advent of page
      numbers. It is also, essentially, a history of the codex, the book as we know it, which can be riffled and browsed, its pages accessed at whim, unlike the unwieldy scroll. If those topics don’t get your heart racing, perhaps this isn’t the book for
      you—but that would be a shame. Duncan’s enthusiasms are contagious, such as his effusion over the “characterful” gothic capital &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;—actually meant to stand for 1—the first printed page number, in the margins of a 15th-century printed
      sermon: “I love this J all the more for its blurriness. I would rather it were this way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an age when one can easily search for every instance of a word in a book, and we lack the perseverance to make it through an entire Twitter
      thread, the index is no longer the main suspect in our inability to read properly, as Swift and others once worried. But in one way, the index fear has been realized, insofar as some books are themselves indexes. As early as 1532, Duncan tells us,
      Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Dutch philosopher, wrote an index as a book; more recently, index fans will know of the short-story writer J. G. Ballard’s “The Index,” in which the fantastical narrative comes together through reading the
      alphabetical entries (ending, obliquely, when the indexer, Zielinski, “disappears, 761”).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And indexes have leapt off the page. The artist Helen Mirra has made a practice of creating her own indexes to books, including those of John
      Dewey and W. G. Sebald. For several years the University of Chicago hosted an exhibit of portions of her indexes, writ large, with entries painted on walls in buildings across campus. Encountering them, one could not help reading them as commenting
      on the scene, like museum art labels—so that the real world became the “art.” At the bottom of a severe set of stairs, one painted entry warned “blunders, 18; irreparable, so easy to commit, 114.” Another simply says, “Pauses, odd, 97.” Like any good
      index, all of these labels open up new ways of seeing and categorizing the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, indexes have not brought about the end of reading, but they did presage the dawn of the ubiquitous search engine. Duncan references Google
      maybe too many times (in 14 separate ways, per the index), but no wonder: It is today’s “wormhole” into not just one text but conceivably all texts. Far from displacing indexes, though, it has highlighted their unique ability to make previously
      unforeseen connections between ideas. They catalog our own desire to label and comment, to moor our ideas to the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Skilled players of pachinko—an arcade-style, pinball-like game found mostly in parlors across Japan—know how to launch the game’s small steel balls at just the right moment, with just the right force. But expert ones
      understand that luck can play an even more important role, because parlor managers tend to &lt;a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2002/04/07/general/the-trickle-down-effect/"&gt;interfere with&lt;/a&gt; the machines, changing players’
      winning potential. A single adjustment can improve the chances of victory—or of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Min Jin Lee’s best-selling 2017 novel, &lt;em&gt;Pachinko&lt;/em&gt;, the game is a key motif. The story primarily follows Sunja, the only
      child of a boardinghouse owner, over the course of the 20th century. Born and raised in Japanese-occupied Korea, she leaves her native country for Japan as a young woman and goes on to become the matriarch of a family that eventually thrives because
      of her son’s pachinko business. But like other ethnic Koreans living in Japan at the time, she’s discriminated against and treated as a second-class citizen. Lee examines how Sunja forges her life through a combination of skill and chance, despite
      the invisible hand of history shaping her journey like a tampered-with pachinko machine. Even with its sweeping scope, &lt;em&gt;Pachinko &lt;/em&gt;never reads like a textbook. The pleasure of taking in the novel comes from its unpredictability:
      Sunja seems fated for poverty and hardship, but her decisions—along with the kindness and cruelty of those she meets—produce an engrossing saga that feels both epic and intimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/12/min-jin-lee-by-heart/548810/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Min Jin Lee on what writers can take away from the Bible&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AppleTV+’s eight-episode
      adaptation, out March 25, is equally epic. But the series has, in liberally altering the novel’s structure, lost some of that thoroughly personal touch. Instead of telling the story chronologically like the book does, the show bounces forward and
      backward through time: Sunja (played at different ages by Yu-na Jeon, Minha Kim, and &lt;em&gt;Minari&lt;/em&gt;’s Yuh-Jung Youn) is a young girl weeping in her father’s arms in one moment, and in the next, she’s an old woman sitting alone, lost in
      thought. Rather than prioritize Sunja’s perspective, the drama spends ample time tracking her grandson, Solomon (Jin Ha), a banker who returns to Japan from America in 1989 on business, bringing with him a more modern attitude shaped by his education
      in the States that conflicts with Sunja’s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directed by &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/03/after-yang-colin-farrell-kogonada-interview/627034/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Kogonada&lt;/a&gt; and Justin Chon, the
      series is visually sumptuous, and the weaving of timelines yields some cinematic, transcendent moments: The cacophony of pachinko balls careening through machines in 1989 echoes the sound of rain pattering against the boardinghouse roof in the 1910s.
      A shot of Sunja’s mother carefully tucking Sunja’s few possessions into a sack for her to take abroad as a young woman transitions into a scene of older Sunja packing her own suitcase to prepare for a trip. &lt;em&gt;Pachinko &lt;/em&gt;overlaps and
      intersects such images, creating a tapestry of memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/membership/archive/2018/01/what-makes-historical-fiction-great/552038/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: What makes historical fiction great&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet as gorgeous and masterfully made as the
      series is, that tapestry comes loose through many alterations. Taken cumulatively, they weaken the novel’s emphasis on Sunja and the subtle influences history can have on one person’s life. The novel was remarkably attentive to such details, with
      Lee’s stoic prose illustrating the profundity of mundane experiences, such as a prayer or a shared meal. The show, however, manufactures drama at Sunja’s expense, turning characters’ arcs into intricate mysteries and following &lt;a
      href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-features/serpent-review-made-love-gangs-london-medias-res-chronological-1146240/"&gt;a prestige-TV trend&lt;/a&gt; of complicating timelines for the sake of suspense. Sunja’s tangled affair with Koh Hansu (Lee
      Min-Ho) is depicted as a star-crossed romance, their large age gap downplayed. When her husband, Baek Isak (Steve Sang-Hyun Noh), runs into trouble with Japanese authorities as in the novel, the adaptation invents a more theatrical reason for his
      arrest. The older Sunja often references events from decades earlier, as if creating knots for the viewer to untangle later. The intimacy on the page—Sunja’s personal strife, the blessings and sorrows that make up a life—struggles to reach the
      screen, the texture of her journey sacrificed in service of flashier storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="Jin Ha as Solomon in 'Pachinko'" height="374"
      src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/posts/2022/03/Pachinko_Photo_010101/947610ebd.png" width="665"&gt; &lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Jin Ha as Solomon, Sunja’s grandson and a banker who returns to Japan from America in 1989 on business
      (Apple TV+)&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modifying the source material to fit a new medium isn’t unreasonable; indeed, doing so can work &lt;a
      href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/i-have-notes/61d368aedd6c7f00233182a6/pandemic-station-eleven-show/"&gt;impressively&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/little-women-review-saiorse-ronan-florence-pugh/604114/?utm_source=feed"&gt;well&lt;/a&gt;. But here, these moves reframe a deeply Korean story through an American lens. The show remains
      as precise as the book—the characters speak Korean and Japanese interchangeably, with multicolored subtitles showing how the languages can blend even in the same sentence—and the conflict between Korean and Japanese communities is depicted and
      discussed. In pivoting away from Sunja so often, though, the drama becomes less about the rift between neighboring cultures, a specific conflict rarely captured in Hollywood projects, and instead about the differences between American and broadly
      Asian perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These adjustments would come across more organically if Sunja’s story weren’t told so quickly in comparison with Solomon’s. Lee meticulously tracks Sunja’s progress in the book, but the show rushes through her
      coming-of-age while drawing out her grandson’s fight to convince an elderly Korean woman to sell her land to his client. As Solomon tries to connect with the woman, he recruits Sunja to help him understand her point of view. The shifting focus
      transforms the story from a close examination of one woman’s life in a particular historical context into a more contemporary culture-clash narrative. Like the rest of her generation, Sunja is a riddle for Solomon to solve rather than a character
      with an evolution worth exploring on her own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is a drama that can feel sublime and unsatisfying at the same time. Take the scene with Sunja and Solomon eating a meal with the potential seller Solomon is after. The seller
      makes Korean rice, and Sunja sobs when she tastes it, overwhelmed by a memory of her mother purchasing a small bag of white rice for her wedding when the grain was still a hard-won luxury. That memory, however, isn’t shown until the next episode—and
      even then, the sequence fades into a conversation about the differences between Korea and America, underlining the show’s principal focus on cultural contrasts. Such scenes are exquisitely filmed, and all three actresses who play Sunja deliver
      excellent performances, but the show views her life through her grandson’s eyes. Sunja’s past becomes a series of lessons for him to learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/02/minari/618009/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Minari will draw you in with its beautiful little details&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pachinko &lt;/em&gt;didn’t need such an
      audience proxy in Solomon. Lee’s novel was unapologetically specific, trusting the reader to connect with a character whose story may not resemble anything they’ve encountered in American media before. The show seems to second-guess its audience, and
      thus tries to be more conventionally accessible with flourishes that feel at odds with how immersive the series is otherwise. As if uncertain whether the show has done enough to make its audience invest in Sunja, the finale even ends with a short
      documentary of interviews with real-life Sunjas, elderly Korean women who recount why they remained in Japan. “They endured,” a title card reads before the sequence begins, summarizing their lives before they’ve even spoken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be
      clear, I am happy to see a series like &lt;em&gt;Pachinko &lt;/em&gt;arrive. The show is well intentioned and well made, and many scenes stirred my own memories of conversations with my grandparents about their experiences living through conflicts
      I’ve only read about. But if &lt;em&gt;Pachinko &lt;/em&gt;returns for a second season—which I hope it will, as the first mostly omitted a significant third of the book—it would do well to be bold in its telling of Sunja’s story, to spotlight history
      through her eyes rather than in retrospect. The television landscape can be challenging, discouraging new shows from alienating any audiences at all costs. As Lee’s novel posits, however, life is a gamble; pachinko players know the game might be
      rigged, yet they play nonetheless. The show should take a similar risk.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

      Aneyoshi, a tiny coastal village in Japan, warnings are engraved into the rocks. Most of the messages come from 19th-century survivors of large tsunamis that terrorized people along the coast. “High dwellings are the peace and harmony of our
      descendants,” &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/century-old-warnings-against-tsunamis-dot-japans-coastline-180956448/"&gt;one inscription declares&lt;/a&gt;. “Remember the calamity of the great tsunamis. Do not build any homes
      below this point.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But more recent residents of coastal Japan did build below that point. Homes at first, but eventually nuclear facilities, which were built where they could be cooled by nearby ocean waters. On March 11, 2011, a
      massive undersea earthquake occurred east of Oshika Peninsula. The quake, which lasted six minutes and remains the fourth-most powerful ever recorded in the world, triggered tsunami waves that &lt;a
      href="https://www.livescience.com/39110-japan-2011-earthquake-tsunami-facts.html"&gt;reached&lt;/a&gt; up to 130 feet above sea level. The rushing water ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56252695"&gt;led to a
      meltdown&lt;/a&gt; at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear facility, where a loss of power shut off the cooling system, resulting in hydrogen-gas accumulation. As surprised workers tried to cool the facility manually—using water from fire trucks—a gas
      buildup led to the expulsion of radioactive material into the atmosphere and groundwater. Part of Fukushima prefecture is &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/03/06/the-fukushima-disaster-was-not-the-turning-point-many-had-hoped"&gt;still
      uninhabitable&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure class="left"&gt;&lt;img alt="Book cover of The Devil Never Sleeps" height="414" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/posts/2022/03/The_Devil_Never_Sleeps/44c26d0d8.png" width="263"&gt; &lt;figcaption
      class="caption"&gt;This article is adapted from Kayyem’s &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781541700093"&gt;recent book&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the nuclear disasters at Three Mile Island in 1979 and
      Chernobyl in 1986, &lt;a href="https://thebulletin.org/2020/08/comparing-nuclear-accident-responses-at-three-mile-island-chernobyl-and-fukushima/"&gt;investigators blamed&lt;/a&gt; a combination of mechanical failure and operator error. The
      conventional narrative of Fukushima Daiichi’s demise has been &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/06/why-fukushima-was-preventable-pub-47361"&gt;somewhat more forgiving of the people running the plant that day&lt;/a&gt;. The earthquake
      and tsunami could not be blamed on them. The most fundamental error, news stories intimated, was putting a nuclear reactor in a location &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/21/world/asia/21stones.html?_r=2"&gt;so obviously vulnerable to
      natural disaster&lt;/a&gt;. Previous generations had literally carved warnings in stone: &lt;i&gt;Never again.&lt;/i&gt; Because TEPCO, the plant’s operator, had ignored them and built in a risky spot, tragedy was all but inevitable.
      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made a tidy story, except for one thing: The &lt;a href="https://thebulletin.org/2014/03/onagawa-the-japanese-nuclear-power-plant-that-didnt-melt-down-on-3-11/"&gt;Onagawa nuclear-power plant&lt;/a&gt; also sits below the rock
      warnings, but it withstood the earthquake and tsunami. Onagawa was about 30 miles closer to the epicenter of the earthquake than the Daiichi facility was. It experienced the strongest ground shaking of any of the nuclear facilities in the area—or
      indeed of any nuclear facility in recorded history. Operated by the Tohoku Electric Power Company, the Onagawa reactor did not melt down. It suffered no serious damage. The differing fates of Fukushima Daiichi and Onagawa cannot be explained by the
      movement of the Earth, because neither plant heeded the century-old warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never again&lt;/i&gt; is a common refrain after traumatic disasters, but it’s also a hard promise to keep. Memories fade over time. But more
      important, societies change, and so do their risk calculations. Accepting risk is not itself a form of negligence; Japan needed domestic energy sources to power its economy in the decades after World War II, and nuclear-power plants near the coast
      became essential to the country’s growth. The problem at Fukushima—unlike at Onagawa—was that its designers and managers did not acknowledge or make provision for the risk they had undertaken, so the plant was unprepared when disaster
      struck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/10/the-broken-lives-of-fukushima/100603/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The broken lives of
      Fukushima&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a dangerous omission. Events that threaten human life and safety do not strike at random, nor are they particularly rare. Indeed, an earthquake off the coast of Fukushima today left millions
      of people in Japan without power—and put residents on alert once again for potential tsunamis. All modern societies face environmental hazards; rely on complex, and in some cases dangerous, technologies; and link up to global trade and transportation
      networks that move pathogens as well as people. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onagawa’s strength was simple: The nuclear plant’s operators understood that failure was possible, perhaps even inevitable, so they committed themselves to &lt;a
      href="https://thebulletin.org/2014/03/onagawa-the-japanese-nuclear-power-plant-that-didnt-melt-down-on-3-11/"&gt;failing safely&lt;/a&gt;. Like Fukushima Daiichi, Onagawa was located near the coast. But its designers had studied past tsunamis and
      built at an elevation several meters higher than that of its ill-fated counterpart. Long before the earthquake, Tohoku Electric had also required extensive emergency training and scenario planning, including for a massive tsunami, so Onagawa’s
      employees were ready to shut it down. Departing from the hierarchical norms of Japanese corporate culture, headquarters had delegated authority to the plant managers to react in the moment. Simply put, Onagawa’s &lt;a
      href="https://thebulletin.org/2014/03/onagawa-the-japanese-nuclear-power-plant-that-didnt-melt-down-on-3-11/"&gt;employees had their act together&lt;/a&gt;. Fukushima’s owners had done far less to create a safety culture, and during the meltdown
      required leadership’s approval for every crisis decision. That doesn’t work in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;F&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;or most of my&lt;/span&gt; career, I have studied disasters, managed government responses to
      them, and advised elected leaders and business executives about how to plan for them. I have come to think that the very word &lt;i&gt;disaster&lt;/i&gt; wrongly excuses us from the obligation to plan for failure. The &lt;a
      href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disaster"&gt;word’s original meaning&lt;/a&gt;, from Middle French and Old Italian, comes from the prefix &lt;i&gt;dis-&lt;/i&gt;, signifying a negative force, and &lt;i&gt;astro&lt;/i&gt;, for
      star—implying that disruptive events occur only because the stars were aligned against us, not because of anything we did or didn’t do. The word &lt;i&gt;catastrophe&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;derived from a Greek word meaning “&lt;a
      href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/catastrophe"&gt;sudden turn&lt;/a&gt;,” has a similar connotation: It’s just bad luck, befalling a passive population with no capacity to manage destruction that nobody could have
      foreseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we should not be surprised by natural catastrophes, viral variants, sneak attacks, or other tragedies. &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781541700093"&gt;The devil never sleeps&lt;/a&gt;, I argue in my
      forthcoming book. The good news is that the means to minimize the resulting harm from sudden shocks are always the same: making sure the risk is communicated and widely understood; preparing individuals to respond to a range of scenarios; ensuring
      redundancies in safety systems, so that none becomes the last line of defense; testing those systems; challenging the fallacy that a near miss implies immunity from a future calamity; and making adjustments after past
      mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in my field describe the event precipitating a crisis—an earthquake, a hurricane, the emergence of a new virus—as the “boom,” and we divide time and human activity into two phases: “left of boom” and “right of
      boom.” The former includes the steps we take to prevent the boom from happening in the first place; the latter is what we do in the moments after, and then the weeks and months following, to minimize the harm. But we would be better prepared if we no
      longer viewed disasters as a surprise moment in time. A society that studiously prepares to fail safer—that makes preparation for what will happen right of boom—is a stronger one than a society that focuses a majority of its efforts on avoiding the
      failure itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fukushima Daiichi’s operator, I should note, didn’t do enough of either. After the 1945 bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, many in Japan were deeply apprehensive about using nuclear energy to address the country’s
      needs. TEPCO, Japan’s leading nuclear-power operator, managed to convince itself that it had essentially eliminated any risk. According to Akihisa Shiozaki, a lawyer who organized an independent investigation of the Fukushima disaster, the country
      was sold a myth: “&lt;a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/lessons-leadership-fukushima-nuclear-disaster/"&gt;the absolute safeness&lt;/a&gt;” of nuclear power. A later government report blamed an industry mindset that ignored the
      possibility that even in a nuclear disaster, preparedness could go far in “&lt;a href="https://inis.iaea.org/search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:44017394"&gt;limiting the consequential damage&lt;/a&gt;.” Instead, local opposition had to be managed as more
      nuclear reactors were built, which in many cases meant not talking about the potential for a worst-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2021/03/photos-10-years-great-east-japan-earthquake/618243/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: 10 years since the great East Japan earthquake&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not planning for the right of boom
      makes sudden shocks of all kinds—including the extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change—far more deadly than they might otherwise be. In 2017, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. &lt;a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2019/09/24/763958799/2-years-after-hurricane-maria-hit-puerto-rico-the-exact-death-toll-remains-unkno"&gt;To this day, we still do not know how many people died there&lt;/a&gt;. One reason death estimates varied so widely is
      that most of the deaths were not a direct result of the hurricane itself but downstream consequences of power outages. The losses cascaded: Without electricity, deprivations of water, food, and medicines left people vulnerable. Damage to power
      infrastructure is a predictable outcome of a hurricane. A faster restoration of the grid—in the absence of preparations that would have made it more resistant to failure in the first place—would have saved many lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This logic
      does not only apply after natural disasters. Before the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the military had not adapted its battlefield-medicine rules for an age of urban warfare and improvised explosive devices. Existing rules prioritized carrying
      injured soldiers away from enemy lines to a medic tent or back to base. But those enemy lines were not always clearly defined in America’s post-9/11 conflicts, and many of the wounded bled to death before they could receive proper care. To prevent
      injuries to American soldiers, the Pentagon made massive investments in armor design and mine-resistant, ambush-protected light tactical vehicles to protect U.S. troops from harm. But those improvements were not enough. Right-of-boom protocols needed
      to evolve too: So the &lt;a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2011-12-iraq-war-revolution-battlefield-medicine.html"&gt;military began training&lt;/a&gt; field soldiers, most of whom were not medics, to use tourniquets right away to save the life
      of team members wounded in IED attacks. These efforts—which have since spawned &lt;a href="https://www.army.mil/article/218219/stop_the_bleed_the_simple_art_of_saving_lives"&gt;a civilian public-awareness campaign called “Stop the
      Bleed”&lt;/a&gt;—were a way to minimize harm even after a life-threatening event had already occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;P&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;lanning to fail&lt;/span&gt; safely is different from trying to eliminate all
      risk—which is usually impossible. At this point two years into a global pandemic, for example, even stringent lockdowns are unlikely to prevent all transmission of the coronavirus. When the CDC recently decided to use rates of death and
      hospitalization, rather than overall infection, as its primary metrics for the severity of the problem, the agency implicitly chose to minimize the negative consequences of the virus rather than try to suppress it altogether. Furthermore, attempts to
      banish one kind of risk may make others worse. After the Fukushima disaster, Germany began &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/01/germany-is-closing-its-last-nuclear-plants-what-disaster/"&gt;phasing out nuclear power
      altogether&lt;/a&gt;—a decision that has left it more dependent on fossil fuel from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deliberately accepting some risks, and then being prepared when disaster strikes, will serve human societies better than pretending we can
      achieve perfect safety. We cannot prevent an earthquake or a tsunami, but we have control over how much death and destruction it causes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened at Fukushima wasn’t just bad fortune; Onagawa didn’t get lucky. Most people
      outside Japan have never heard of Onagawa because it was ready to fail under the same conditions that proved cataclysmic at Fukushima. And in disaster management, anonymity—not fame—is a sign of
      success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the span of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/?utm_source=feed"&gt;a couple of weeks&lt;/a&gt;, Vladimir Putin—a man recently described by Donald Trump as a strategic
      “genius”—managed to revitalize NATO, unify a splintered West, turn Ukraine’s little-known president into a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/zelensky-congress-speech-no-fly-zone/627080/?utm_source=feed"&gt;global
      hero&lt;/a&gt;, wreck Russia’s economy, and solidify his legacy as a murderous war criminal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How did he miscalculate so badly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, you have to understand the power and information ecosystems
      around dictators. I’ve studied &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781982154097"&gt;and interviewed&lt;/a&gt; despots across the globe for more than a decade. In my research, I’ve persistently encountered a stubborn myth—of the savvy strongman,
      the rational, calculating despot who can play the long game because he (and it’s typically a he) doesn’t have to worry about pesky polls or angry voters. Our elected leaders, this view suggests, are no match for the tyrant who gazes into the next
      decade rather than fretting about next year’s election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reality doesn’t conform to that rosy theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autocrats such as Putin eventually succumb to what may be called the “dictator trap.” The strategies they use to
      stay in power tend to trigger their eventual downfall. Rather than being long-term planners, many make catastrophic short-term errors—the kinds of errors that would likely have been avoided in democratic systems. They hear only from sycophants, and
      get bad advice. They misunderstand their population. They don’t see threats coming until it’s too late. And unlike elected leaders who leave office to riches, book tours, and the glitzy lifestyle of a statesman, many dictators who miscalculate leave
      office in a casket, a possibility that makes them even more likely to double down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despots sow the seeds of their own demise early on, when they first face the trade-off between allowing freedom of expression and maintaining an iron
      grip on power. After arriving in the palace, crushing dissent and jailing opponents is often rational, from the perspective of a dictator: It creates a culture of fear that is useful for establishing and maintaining control. But that culture of fear
      comes with a cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of us living in liberal democracies, criticizing the boss is risky, but we’re not going to be shipped off to a gulag or watch our family get tortured. In authoritarian regimes, those all-too-real risks
      have a way of focusing the mind. Is it ever worthwhile for authoritarian advisers to speak truth to power?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, despots rarely get told that their stupid ideas are stupid, or that their ill-conceived wars are likely to be
      catastrophic. Offering honest criticism is a deadly game and most advisers avoid doing so. Those who dare to gamble eventually lose and are purged. So over time, the advisers who remain are usually yes-men who act like bobbleheads, nodding along when
      the despot outlines some crackpot scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with such seemingly loyal cronies, despots face a dilemma. How can you trust the loyalty of an entourage that has every reason to lie and conceal its true thoughts? The ancient Greek
      philosopher Xenophon wrote of that inescapable paradox of tyranny: “It is never possible for the tyrant to trust that he is loved … and plots against tyrants spring from none more than from those who pretend to love them most.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To
      solve this problem, despots create loyalty tests, ghoulish charades to separate true believers from pretenders. To be trusted, advisers must &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0951629820927790"&gt;lie on behalf of the
      regime&lt;/a&gt;. Those who repeat absurd claims without blinking are deemed loyal. Anyone who hesitates is considered suspect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kim Jong Un’s North Korea, for example, the lies have gotten progressively more ridiculous. Once a
      lie becomes widely accepted, the value of that individual loyalty test declines. Once &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; knows that Kim Jong Un &lt;a
      href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/kim-jongun-learned-to-drive-at-age-three-north-korean-children-to-be-taught-10165694.html"&gt;learned to drive when he was just 3 years old&lt;/a&gt;, a new, more extreme lie must emerge for the
      test to serve its purpose. The cycle repeats itself, and a cult of personality is born.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plenty of people around Putin understood that dynamic, which is why they were willing to parrot Putin’s outlandish claim that the Jewish
      president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, is &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-invasion-russias-foreign-minister-sergei-lavrov-rants-about-napoleon-hitler-hollywood-films-and-ukraines-nazi-battalions-12556406"&gt;presiding over a
      “neo-Nazi” state&lt;/a&gt;. (Such &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/02/putin-russia-ukraine-revisionist-history/622936/?utm_source=feed"&gt;mythmaking&lt;/a&gt; can happen in democracies too, if you have an
      authoritarian-style leader. Just consider how many Republicans have fallen over one another to endorse Donald Trump’s lies about the 2020 election in order to prove their MAGA bona fides.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to stay in power, despots have to worry
      about more than just their advisers and cronies. They have to win over, intimidate, or coerce their population too. That’s why dictators invest in state-sponsored media. In Russia, the state goes so far as to present &lt;a
      href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781610396004"&gt;fake presidential candidates&lt;/a&gt; who pretend to oppose Putin in &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780300246650"&gt;rigged elections&lt;/a&gt;. The whole system is a Potemkin village,
      an illusion of choice and political debate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, that mechanism of control comes with a cost. Some citizens brainwashed by state propaganda will support a war that is sure to backfire. Others privately oppose the regime, but will
      be too afraid to say anything. As a result, reliable polling doesn’t exist in autocracies. (Russia is &lt;a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/russias-polling-industry-is-gravely-wrong-heres-how-to-change-it/"&gt;no exception&lt;/a&gt;.) That
      means that despots like Putin are unable to accurately understand the attitudes of their own people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you live in a fake world long enough, it can start to feel real. Dictators and despots begin to believe their own lies, repeated
      back at them and propagated by state-controlled media. That might help explain why Putin’s recent speeches have stood out as &lt;a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/its-not-rational-putins-bizarre-speech-wrecks-his-once-pragmatic-image"&gt;unhinged rants&lt;/a&gt;. It’s certainly possible that his mind has succumbed to his own propaganda, creating a warped
      worldview in which the invasion of Ukraine was, as Trump put it, an incredibly “savvy” move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risks of miscalculation are compounded, psychology research has shown, by the fact that &lt;a
      href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.203.2748&amp;amp;rep=rep1&amp;amp;type=pdf"&gt;power literally goes to your head&lt;/a&gt;, including in a key way that may be relevant in explaining Putin’s costly gambit in Ukraine.
      The longer someone is in power, the more they begin to get a sense of what is known as “illusory control,” a mistaken &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corruptible-Who-Gets-Power-Changes/dp/1982154098"&gt;belief that they can control
      outcomes&lt;/a&gt; much more than they actually can. That delusion is particularly dangerous in dictatorships, in which there are virtually no checks or balances, no term limits or free elections to boot someone from power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some
      Russia experts, such as Fiona Hill, have recently suggested that Putin has spent much of the pandemic isolated and alone, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/02/28/world-war-iii-already-there-00012340"&gt;poring over old
      maps&lt;/a&gt; of the lost Russian “imperium.” Cumulatively, it’s possible to imagine how these factors combined to convince Putin that his brutal blunder in Ukraine was a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When despots screw up, they need to watch their
      own back. Yet again, they can become victims of the dictator trap. To crush prospective enemies, they must demand loyalty and crack down on criticism. But the more they do so, the lower the quality of information they receive, and the less they can
      trust the people who purport to serve them. As a result, even when government officials learn about plots to overthrow an autocrat, they may not share that knowledge. This is known as the “vacuum effect”—and it means that authoritarian presidents
      might learn of coup attempts and putsches only when it’s too late. This raises a question that should keep Putin awake at night: If the oligarchs were to eventually make a move against him, would anyone warn him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, Putin is
      no fool. But as we debate possible endgames to the war in Ukraine, we shouldn’t kid ourselves. Putin, like many despots, isn’t behaving fully rationally. He inhabits a fantasy world, surrounded by people who are afraid to challenge him, with a mind
      that has been poisoned by more than two decades as a tyrant. He’s made a catastrophic mistake in Ukraine—one that may yet prove his downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democracy isn’t perfect. It’s messy. It can be shortsighted. Many powerful democracies,
      including the United States, are dysfunctional. But at least our leaders face real constraints, real pushback for their miscalculations, and real criticism from their population. And, crucially, there’s a built-in mechanism to replace our leaders
      when they start to behave irrationally or irresponsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why it’s time to jettison the myth of the “savvy” strongman, or the dictator who’s a geopolitical “genius.” Putin has fallen victim to the dictator trap and proved that
      he is neither.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated at 7:34 p.m. ET on March 15, 2022 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if older Americans had been forced to weather the past three months without the option of a booster
      shot. Having an additional vaccine dose during the Omicron surge cut seniors’ risks of &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination"&gt;hospitalization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
      href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; by more than 70 percent. But the extra shots still didn’t come close to eliminating risk: Boosted adults ages 65 and older were still &lt;a
      href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#covidnet-hospitalizations-vaccination"&gt;hospitalized&lt;/a&gt; at nearly twice the rate—and &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status"&gt;dying&lt;/a&gt; at 16
      times the rate—of unboosted 18-to-49-year-olds, despite the fact that far fewer seniors were &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#rates-by-vaccine-status"&gt;testing positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given
      these persistent risks, the possibility of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/waning-immunity-not-all-bad/620436/?utm_source=feed"&gt;waning immunity&lt;/a&gt;, and the apparent onset of a &lt;a
      href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/03/13/covid-cases-rising-europe/7026697001/"&gt;new wave of cases&lt;/a&gt; across Europe, even boosted Americans over 65 might be feeling a little nervous. Pfizer asked the FDA to &lt;a
      href="https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-submit-us-emergency-use-authorization"&gt;authorize a fourth shot&lt;/a&gt; for older people today, and &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/09/booster-bandits-ethics/620048/?utm_source=feed"&gt;not much is stopping&lt;/a&gt; seniors who want to re-boost from doing so already. Whether they ought to is a different matter: Given that
      COVID rates in the United States are pretty low right now, and that we don’t have a ton of information yet about the value (or potential downsides) of the extra shot, most seniors should probably wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As humans age, &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/vaccinate-old/622080/?utm_source=feed"&gt;our immune systems tend to get weaker&lt;/a&gt; in the same way that our bones and joints and memories do. That’s why older Americans are more
      vulnerable to bad outcomes from COVID, and it’s also why they were among the first to be eligible for COVID-vaccine boosters in the fall. Back then, the CDC’s primary motivation for allowing more shots hinged on &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/waning-immunity-not-all-bad/620436/?utm_source=feed"&gt;waning immunity&lt;/a&gt;: After several months, the vaccines weren’t doing as good a job at keeping people, and &lt;a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/health/cdc-vaccine-advisers-booster-wane/index.html"&gt;especially older people&lt;/a&gt;, from getting sick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, on top of the vaccines’ diminished effectiveness against Omicron, something
      similar might be happening again. In the United Kingdom, the effectiveness of a third Pfizer dose at preventing symptomatic COVID was shown to fall &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2119451"&gt;from 67 to 46 percent&lt;/a&gt;
      within a few months after vaccination. A &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(22)00135-9/fulltext"&gt;study published in &lt;em&gt;The Lancet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in late February found that blood samples taken
      from a small group of elderly people showed a steep decline in neutralizing activity against Omicron over the span of three and a half months following a first booster shot. These results are expected and not inherently concerning. What’s more
      important and less clear is how much, if at all, protection against severe disease and hospitalization is waning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of these trends are very preliminary, as are the data on whether adding one more dose actually helps. A
      yet-to-be-peer-reviewed study of healthy medical workers in Israel who had received a second booster showed an &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.22270948v1.full.pdf"&gt;eightfold increase in antibodies against
      Omicron&lt;/a&gt; two weeks after the shot. Among Israelis 60 and older, who have been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/israel-to-start-giving-4th-vaccine-dose-to-people-older-than-60"&gt;eligible for a second
      booster&lt;/a&gt; since early January, those who received it were one-quarter as likely as the singly boosted to be &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.01.22270232v1.full.pdf"&gt;hospitalized with severe COVID&lt;/a&gt; at the
      peak of the country’s &lt;a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/israel/"&gt;Omicron surge&lt;/a&gt;. But no one can say how long that improved protection will last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
      question of durability might matter more now than it did in the fall. In September, experts were fairly confident that a winter wave was coming; even if the boost lasted only, say, five months, the fresh antibodies of a senior jabbed in October would
      likely last through the worst of the surge. Today, Omicron is in retreat in the United States (&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/omicron-peak-covid-what-happens-next/621257/?utm_source=feed"&gt;at least for
      now&lt;/a&gt;), and we’re eight-ish months away from the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/covid-seasonal-winter/620766/?utm_source=feed"&gt;next possible winter surge&lt;/a&gt;, and four-ish months from a summer surge
      that would match the ones in 2020 and 2021. But &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/03/covid-vaccine-mandate-restaurant/627018/?utm_source=feed"&gt;pandemic protections are dropping&lt;/a&gt; around the country, and cases in
      Europe, which have sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/watch-uk-understand-delta/619647/?utm_source=feed"&gt;been a harbinger for the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, appear to be on the rise. Who’s to say we won’t find ourselves
      in the middle of another surge any minute now? Such uncertainties make it much harder to predict now when older Americans might need an additional booster shot, because doing so would mean predicting the timing of the next peak in
      cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with this dilemma, a COVID-conscious senior might be tempted to boost now, while their immunity might be low, and just grab another shot in a couple of months if cases start to swing back upward. But such a plan could
      backfire. John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, told me that boosting too often with the original-recipe vaccine—the only kind that’s available in the U.S. right now—could lead a person’s immune system to react to newer,
      less similar variants such as Omicron with reduced vigor. Plus, something better could be right around the corner. &lt;a
      href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04955626?term=BNT162b2%2C+fourth%2C+4th&amp;amp;age=2&amp;amp;draw=2&amp;amp;rank=4"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05249829"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; are testing
      &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/02/omicron-only-vaccine-protect-against-variants/621431/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Omicron-specific boosters&lt;/a&gt;—though the &lt;a
      href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00003-y"&gt;underwhelming preliminary results&lt;/a&gt; make Wherry think that those shots in particular are not worth holding out for. He’s more excited about the possibility of mucosal vaccines and
      the eventual arrival of &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/06/novavax-now-best-covid-19-vaccine/619276/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Novavax’s protein-based shot&lt;/a&gt;, which has a promising efficacy and safety profile but is
      still awaiting the FDA’s green light. One of these alternative designs may end up being a better match for the mature immune system. (A &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/shingrix/index.html"&gt;protein-based shot&lt;/a&gt;,
      for example, is nearly twice as effective as a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/zostavax/index.html"&gt;live-attenuated vaccine&lt;/a&gt; at preventing shingles in seniors.) The only way to know whether older people
      respond better to a different sort of vaccine will be to test it, Mark Slifka, an immunologist at Oregon Health and Science University, told me. “You need to cater to each particular bug.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fourth shot, then, might give seniors
      more protection for an unknown period of time against a disease that is currently in decline in the U.S., and it might jeopardize some of their protection against that same disease when cases begin to rise again. Lona Mody, a geriatrician at the
      University of Michigan, told me that she doesn’t think we have enough data yet to recommend second boosters to seniors across the board. But if one of her patients felt that they needed one—say they have a family event coming up where they’ll be
      inside with lots of people, some of whom might not be vaccinated—“I would definitely consider it,” she said. Slifka agreed that these decisions should be made in consultation with a doctor, and in consideration of whether a particular senior lives
      alone or in a congregate setting, their general health, and whether they have a high-exposure job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherry said he’d like to see a national surveillance system for COVID immunity, in which Americans could get periodic immunity
      checkups on their antibody levels and learn whether boosting would do anything for them. “This is feasible, both scientifically and medically,” he said. And by studying the resulting data, the CDC could make more informed decisions about when (or
      whether) to recommend boosters for everyone. For the moment, though, unless you’re at particularly high risk of getting COVID because of where you live or work, there’s really no rush.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Suppose Charles Dickens had died in 1850, at age 38—perhaps in a railway accident like the crash, in 1865, that killed 10 of his fellow passengers and left his nerves permanently frayed; or, more fantastically, from
      spontaneous combustion, as befell the booze-soaked rag seller in his 1853 novel, &lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He would still be famous, though perhaps less so than he is now. Readers left with only his early works would have
      eight full-length novels to savor, including &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pickwick Papers&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/em&gt;, as well as a tottering stack of novellas, stories, and travel
      writing. But our sense of Dickens, and the century that produced him, would be altered. We would notice his sentiment more, and his social mission less. His critical reputation would be less sturdy, and snobbish professors would dismiss him as
      largely a storyteller for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/06/was-dickens-a-thief/392072/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Was Dickens a
      thief?&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This did not happen. Unlike the many orphans, infants, and laborers who in his novels perish unloved and unwanted, Dickens lived on into middle age. And the events of 1851—the halfway point of the
      century, and of Dickens’s career—pressed him toward an artistic evolution. In that year he began writing &lt;a href="http://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780141439723"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in which he sought to capture, through
      formal and stylistic experimentation, the density and complexity of 19th-century London. The story unearths hidden connections among far-flung people (dancing teachers, detectives, street sweepers). A novel of networks, &lt;em&gt;Bleak
      House&lt;/em&gt; offered its readers a powerful model for thinking about urban life: a new kind of literature for a new kind of world.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; In &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780525655947"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Turning
      Point&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the literary scholar Robert Douglas-Fairhurst studies Dickens’s mid-career reinvention by zooming in on this single year, 1851. It was the year of the Great Exhibition in London. Marvels from around the world—an enormous
      diamond from India, saxophones from Paris—were displayed in the Crystal Palace, a colossal structure made of glass. (The young socialist polymath William Morris was reportedly so overcome by the exhibit’s crass materialism that he rushed from the
      glittering halls and vomited in the bushes.) Beyond the Crystal Palace, the world was becoming modern. The train and the telegraph made long distances feel short. Commentators hailed the progress of industry, as Britain’s robust manufacturing sector
      exported textiles, steam engines, and more. Yet the streets of London teemed with the starving and desperate. Raw sewage caked the banks of the Thames. Prescient British scientists warned that the destruction of tropical rainforests could yield
      “calamities for future generations.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to an urbanizing world in which rapid material progress seemed to immiserate, rather than lift, the poor, Dickens developed a harsher and more experimental mode of writing. He had
      long been interested in social reform, and was a leading voice on problems of poverty and inequality—what Victorian men and women of letters called, rather grandly, the “condition of England.” In 1851, he was managing Urania Cottage, a home for
      “fallen women,” and editing &lt;i&gt;Household Words&lt;/i&gt;, a journal of social commentary and fiction. (His powers of compassion were &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/05/the-dark-side-of-dickens/308031/?utm_source=feed"&gt;in important ways limited&lt;/a&gt;: He applauded the violent suppression of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and tried to have his wife,
      Catherine, placed in an asylum during their ugly separation.) &lt;i&gt;Bleak House&lt;/i&gt; marked a turn toward a more mature and pessimistic social consciousness, inaugurating what one critic has called his “dark” novels. These dense and symbolic
      late works reflect his sorrow at the cruelties of his age. Plenty of political art fades into the annals of sociology. Dickens’s deepening confrontation with injustice, however, led to an artistic breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas-Fairhurst’s
      biography, stuffed with a curiosity shop’s worth of literary gossip and Victoriana, begins with the author in medias res. In 1851, having recently published &lt;em&gt;David Copperfield&lt;/em&gt;, Dickens was casting around for his next big project.
      By this time, he was the most famous writer in England. But his reputation, Douglas-Fairhurst observes, was “surprisingly unstable,” dogged by critical skepticism. Some readers wondered if Dickens had “written himself out.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/10/dickens-in-love-how-the-authors-romantic-life-affected-his-novels/246383/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Dickens in love: How the
      author's romantic life affected his novels&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late November, Dickens began the work that became &lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;, determined to wrest the chaotic realities of a world in flux into a narrative
      shape. Earlier industrial or “social-problem” novels by authors such as Elizabeth Gaskell and Benjamin Disraeli had aimed to document the suffering of workers and poor people; Dickens himself had presented a scorching critique of the Victorian
      workhouse system in &lt;em&gt;Oliver Twist&lt;/em&gt;. With &lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;, however, he sought to do something different: assimilate the new sensations of urban capitalism—marked by bewilderment, bureaucracy, and the collision of
      strangers—into a multi-plot novel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas two decades later George Eliot would produce, with &lt;em&gt;Middlemarch&lt;/em&gt;, a novel of social connection that transcends, in its moral wisdom and psychological
      acuity,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;virtually any other work of Victorian realism, the task Dickens set himself in &lt;em&gt;Bleak House &lt;/em&gt;was more ambitious in scale. He was taking an entire city as his subject. Little wonder, then, that
      he found it hard going. He complained to his friend and future biographer, John Forster, that he was laboring to “grind sparks out of this dull blade.” His manuscripts for &lt;em&gt;Bleak House &lt;/em&gt;show evidence of painstaking corrections and
      reworking, unlike the easy fluency of his early novels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some authors find it necessary to maintain distance from the society they’re writing about. Dickens felt the opposite. The world he created in &lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;
      arose from his enmeshment in the city of London and his familiarity with the streets on which he walked as many as 20 miles a day. From its first word—“LONDON”—&lt;em&gt;Bleak House &lt;/em&gt;announces itself as a study of contemporary urban
      life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plot revolves around two primary narrative arcs: the mystery of the innocent Esther Summerson’s parentage, and the interminable lawsuit &lt;em&gt;Jarndyce and Jarndyce&lt;/em&gt;, a matter of disputed inheritance. As is
      typical of Dickens, idiosyncratic minor characters and one-off comic set pieces provide much of the reading pleasure. Synthesizing several genres—the social-problem novel, the coming-of-age novel, the detective story—&lt;em&gt;Bleak House&lt;/em&gt;
      stands as a landmark of Victorian realism, yet also opened the gates toward future literary experiments. In its critique of an impenetrable bureaucracy, the novel looks ahead to Franz Kafka. And its grotesque characters, its relish for parody, and
      its emphasis on problems of textual interpretation—illegible signs, mysterious legal documents, and other written artifacts proliferate in the novel—anticipate signature themes in the works of postmodern authors such as Thomas Pynchon and David
      Foster Wallace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleak House &lt;/em&gt;acknowledges the confusion of industrial life, opening with its famous images of London fog. Yet it also offers a guide for how to think about the tangled web of the modern city. The
      novel discloses a vision of urban life in which everyone from the poor, degraded street sweeper Jo to the haughty aristocratic Lady Dedlock turns out to be tightly connected. (Jo’s smallpox infection is transmitted to Esther; Lady Dedlock is revealed
      to be closer to Esther than either of them knew.)&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Through images of shared engulfment—fog, mud, disease—Dickens joined together seemingly disparate elements of modern life. He also presented an implicit case for social reform. By
      tracing the vectors that link various levels of society, such as disease, kinship, and the simple fact of shared residence in London, Dickens encouraged his readers to think of the rich and the poor as, in Douglas-Fairhurst’s summation, “parts of the
      same story.” Processing the chaos of London through a powerful and idiosyncratic imagination, he depicted a community bound together in a common fate.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; Dickens once complained that without the buzzing life and teeming crowds of
      London, his imagination grew cramped. London, he wrote, was his “magic lantern”; his characters “seem disposed to stagnate without crowds about them.” Dickens needed the city, and the city needed Dickens. As we re-stitch urban life after two years of
      dislocation, &lt;em&gt;Bleak House &lt;/em&gt;might reveal the secret principles that underlie the city as a system.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not long after tanks rolled into Ukraine, Vladimir Putin started to block social media at home. Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok were curtailed. The move was straight out of the contemporary dictator’s playbook: Take away
      the potential to go viral, and people can’t spread a narrative that might undermine the leader’s legitimacy. It was also a sign that Putin is wary of the loud, public criticisms that have fueled many global protest movements over the past decade. Yet
      high-visibility social-media platforms are not the sole domain of resistance. Alongside them is a quieter, focused, and private medium that Ukrainians and Russians against the war have turned to: the chat app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Eastern Europe,
      Telegram is proving the most popular of these platforms—just last summer it hit &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/30/telegram-tops-1-billion-downloads/"&gt;1 billion downloads&lt;/a&gt;, with Russians being the second-most-frequent users in
      the world. Launched in 2013, Telegram has already shown itself to be enormously helpful for protesters in places such as &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/08/belaurus-protest-tactics-hong-kong/615454/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Hong Kong and Belarus&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the dominant social-media platforms, with their ping-pong of loud, public
      declarations all looking to grab &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/03/tiktok-war-ukraine-russia/627017/?utm_source=feed"&gt;maximum attention&lt;/a&gt;, a chat app operates on the kind of lower register that has always
      been crucial for a healthy civil society. What it offers is some degree of privacy and focus on the internet, a sphere where we frequently assume all our utterances are automatically for public consumption and where our concentration is scrambled
      every other second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Telegram might appear similar to messengers like WhatsApp but, importantly, it contains public channels that allow for one-to-many communication. Telegram doesn’t point users toward these channels, and you need
      to subscribe to receive their feeds. Each is a silo, a dedicated newswire not meant for commenting or sharing. &lt;em&gt;The Kyiv Independent&lt;/em&gt; runs a good example of one: As I’m writing this, the scrappy English-language news publication,
      which started up just a few months ago, has nearly 50,000 subscribers, and is providing a steady drumbeat of dispatches that never exceed a couple hundred words, perhaps about the location of Russian air strikes or the latest sanctions. Other
      channels have more than &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/telegram-ukraine-russia-channels-signal/"&gt;1 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;—enabled by an unlimited maximum size that also differentiates Telegram from other major chat apps. More
      familiar from other messengers are the closed groups. These are now being used by Mariupol residents looking to find missing relatives and by relief workers throughout Ukraine coordinating refugee caravans headed for the Polish border. In addition to
      these options for connecting collectively, Telegram allows users to send one-to-one messages, which operate much like regular text messages except they can be end-to-end encrypted—that is, secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any of these capabilities can be
      weaponized, of course, and Telegram also has a reputation as home to conspiracy theorists, rights-wing extremists, and drug dealers. In the United States, many of the people kicked off mainstream platforms for violating their rules have reemerged on
      Telegram. Some of the individuals who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, used Telegram to plan the day’s events ahead of time, &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/?utm_source=feed"&gt;according to federal prosecutors&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Der Spiegel&lt;/em&gt; article &lt;a
      href="https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-telegram-billionaire-and-his-dark-empire-a-f27cb79f-86ae-48de-bdbd-8df604d07cc8"&gt;recently referred&lt;/a&gt; to the app as “a darknet in your pocket.” And one can easily imagine how such an app
      could be used in Russia and Ukraine to disseminate disinformation or give bad actors a place to hang out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/01/isiss-favorite-messaging-app-has-a-security-problem/422460/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The flaw in ISIS's favorite messaging app&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That good or evil can
      flourish in closed rooms shouldn’t be a surprise, but it doesn’t take away from this tool’s importance for activists and dissidents. To see why, you just have to compare this moment to the Arab Spring, which began a little over a decade ago. At that
      time, Facebook and Twitter were praised for their ability as powerful bullhorns to get protesters to the streets with great speed and at enormous scale. In Egypt, they enabled the massive turnout at Tahrir Square that eventually brought down
      then-President Hosni Mubarak. The problems came afterward. The unlikely coalition that came together to protest found social media largely useless for the purpose of building and sustaining political power. This was especially true when faced with
      the well-oiled machines of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian army, entities with the hierarchical structure and ideological cohesion to get what they wanted out of a leadership vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahmoud Salem, one of the activists who
      was in Tahrir Square, wrote at the time that social media gave the revolution a “spirit for destruction.” The constant push for attention, the &lt;a
      href="https://theconversation.com/history-tells-us-that-ideological-purity-spirals-rarely-end-well-140888"&gt;purity spiraling&lt;/a&gt; in which each activist had to prove himself more loyal to the revolution than any other, the disdain for the
      compromises of politics or the hard work of organizing—the coalition’s problems all seemed to extend from the culture of highly public platforms. It was, Salem wrote, “group-think on steroids—an abomination of a monster with thousands of arms and no
      brain.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how is a chat app different? Consider the varied definitions of what it means to be “social.” Facebook or Twitter is social in the way a large cocktail party is, where you move from one conversation to the next, only
      half-hearing most of what is said, and where the loudest voice or funniest joke grabs everyone’s attention. You might come home from the festivities with a slight buzz but wonder whether you actually connected with anyone. A chat app can be social
      like a huddle of people in focused conversation. Participants are speaking to be heard by one another, not by the entire world. There is more concentration and potential for intimacy, and much less performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ukrainians and
      Russians resisting the war, the different ways of engaging through Telegram—receiving information through dedicated channels, forming groups committed to one topic, or chattering in hushed tones—benefit a people that will likely have to sustain a
      long insurgency. Using a tool such as this one provides the opportunity to build what Zeynep Tufekci in her book, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780300234176"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter and Tear Gas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, calls “network
      internalities”: all those deep relationships that help any movement survive through hardships—as there no doubt will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chat apps are merely the latest expression of the smaller, more controlled spaces that have always been central
      to incubating new ideas or challenging existing ones. During an earlier iteration of Russian authoritarianism, in the Soviet Union, samizdat played this role. The underground, illegal, and self-produced writing, passed hand to hand, kept alive a
      shadow civil society during repressive periods. Samizdat allowed ideas to be exchanged, human- and civil-rights violations to be documented, a whole alternative worldview and set of values to ferment. The lineage of such underground communication
      stretches across history, from the 17th-century scholars in Europe who collaborated through letters on scientific experiments in defiance of Church doctrine all the way to the xeroxed and stapled zines of the 1990s, which set the tone of third-wave
      feminism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Telegram is a similarly vital tool, it still comes with issues. Every cybersecurity expert I spoke with emphasized how insecure the app actually is. Even though it touts its own safety, it doesn’t actually have
      end-to-end encryption—the gold standard of messaging privacy—by default. You only get it when you opt in to its “secret messages” function in one-to-one communication. For Eva Galperin, the director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier
      Foundation, this is a big worry. She knows she won’t be able to get people off an app that they and all of their acquaintances use (the well-known “&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/whatsapp-and-the-erosion-of-the-network-effect/283980/?utm_source=feed"&gt;network effect&lt;/a&gt;”), but she’s trying to encourage some kind of “harm reduction” among users—a term she
      told me she “stole blatantly from social workers trying to help drug addicts.” Reducing harm might mean making sure, for example, that users turn on the app’s self-destruct function for messages so that if their phones are confiscated, authorities
      can’t view their missives. The chance that Ukrainians will actually switch en masse to a more secure app like Signal is slim, although according to the internet-security company Cloudflare, four days after the invasion began, &lt;a
      href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1498170693439029248?s=20&amp;amp;t=Yk2dEQep_huTY4_UnJ03Pw"&gt;traffic to Signal&lt;/a&gt; in Ukraine exceeded that of traffic to Telegram for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other worry about Telegram
      is its opacity as a company. Telegram’s founder, Pavel Durov, is a Russian national of whom little is known beyond the photos he posts of himself shirtless and doing yoga poses in Dubai. In the first days of the war, he surprised users by telling his
      own 650,000-subscriber channel that he just might shut down Telegram because it was “increasingly becoming a source of unverified information.” But he quickly backtracked and posted again to prove that he was no friend to the Russian
      authorities—Durov had to leave both Russia and his first company in 2013 when, he said, he refused to hand over data on Ukrainian protesters. There is little transparency around the company’s decisions, the state of its servers, or how it monitors
      what happens on its platform. Durov’s rare and delphic pronouncements are no reassurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether Telegram itself survives or is eventually supplanted by another app is of secondary importance. What matters is that embattled
      Ukrainians and anti-war Russians are attempting to practice privacy and quiet communication—necessary virtues for a resistance movement. Social media and their attractions may have allowed us to forget just how important these ways of connecting have
      always been for any struggle. But if this war is returning us to many &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/ukraine-identity-russia-patriotism/622902/?utm_source=feed"&gt;historical truths&lt;/a&gt;—most of which we hoped to
      have left on the ash heap—this one at least points toward the tools needed to put up a lasting fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;small&gt;​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission. Thank you for

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Plastics have always been global—even before science began tracking the peregrinations of microplastics &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772416622000146"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; meridians, into

      href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/019713608806112151"&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;–era rubber goods were fashioned with latex extracted from the &lt;a

      regime&lt;/a&gt; in the Democratic Republic of Congo. England imported &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40542850"&gt;gutta-percha&lt;/a&gt; from Southeast Asia for undersea telegraphy wires. Celluloid depended on &lt;a

      href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214629620300566"&gt;hydrocarbons&lt;/a&gt; siphoned from beneath Appalachia’s shale basin to become plastics in Europe. And much of the plastic waste from Europe and the U.S. &lt;a
      href="https://myemail.constantcontact.com/Plastic-Waste-Trade-Violations.html?soid=1114999858498&amp;amp;aid=TjuIS3s34Ao"&gt;streams &lt;/a&gt;back toward &lt;a
      href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/trash-trade-wars-southeast-asias-problem-worlds-waste"&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/climate/oil-kenya-africa-plastics-trade.html"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/24/latin-america-urges-us-to-reduce-plastic-waste-exports-to-region"&gt;South America&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the dispersal of plastics and their pollutants, if regulated at all, has been addressed
      through a patchwork of municipal and national policies and a smattering of &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/regulatory-landscape-single-use-plastics-shows-widespread-momentum"&gt;uncoordinated&lt;/a&gt; international
      instruments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this month, however, following 10 days of late-night negotiations in Nairobi, Kenya, the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) passed a &lt;a
      href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/38522/k2200647_-_unep-ea-5-l-23-rev-1_-_advance.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; mandating the creation of a multilateral treaty to address plastic pollution. One
      hundred seventy-five nations backed its provisions, which are to be legally binding, rather than voluntary. Once in force, the treaty could be plastics’ symbolic &lt;a
      href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/speech/leap-forward-environmental-action"&gt;equivalent&lt;/a&gt; of the Paris Agreement on climate change, and in its provisions, likely even more far-reaching. The meeting &lt;a
      href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/what-you-need-know-about-plastic-pollution-resolution"&gt;ended in&lt;/a&gt; an ebullient wave of joy and tired-teary relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution impanels an international negotiating
      committee and issues it a broad mandate: a treaty outlining global ground rules to eliminate plastic pollution. Most significant is the breadth of the resolution’s ambition—the committee must consider plastic as more than a matter of marine litter.
      Rather, the treaty will take on plastics’ entire &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.0c05295"&gt;life cycle&lt;/a&gt;—from production and design through use and reuse to disposal and environmental dispersion—and will address
      plastics’ myriad contributions to the “&lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/speech/triple-planetary-crisis-forging-new-relationship-between-people-and-earth"&gt;triple planetary crisis&lt;/a&gt;” of climate change, biodiversity loss, and
      pollution. This treaty could govern not just micro- and nanoplastic pollution, but also the air pollutants, greenhouse-gas emissions, and toxic chemicals associated with plastics. The scope of the work is breathtaking and the timeframe ambitious:
      just over two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What transpires between the resolution and the treaty will determine whether the final provisions are likely to make meaningful change. In the coming months, the United Nations Environment Programme will convene
      a working-group meeting, to include member states and private-sector and civil-society stakeholders, which will set the formal agenda for the negotiations to come. The final treaty’s success will rest on how inclusive a process the working group and
      negotiating committee follow, and whose experiences are enfolded into its deliberations. The strongest possible treaty will recognize a range of relationships to plastics and its assorted pollutants—including those of constituents who, across time
      and geography, have borne the heaviest, life-altering burdens of plastics production, and of people who require plastics to live or to earn a living. Plastics have engendered violence, but also resilience and community mobilization to mitigate those
      harms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The treaty’s strength will come from how negotiators resolve a few key issues. One is whether the treaty will limit pollution by limiting production—to close the tap, as so evocatively signaled by the sculpture, by the artist
      &lt;a href="https://pandasnotplastic.com/"&gt;Benjamin Von Wong&lt;/a&gt;, installed outside the UNEA meetings, a floating spigot with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thevonwong/status/1496128914929897475"&gt;40-foot&lt;/a&gt; torrent of &lt;a
      href="https://twitter.com/thevonwong/status/1496128914929897475"&gt;locally&lt;/a&gt; gleaned plastic waste. The rate of world plastics production exceeds &lt;a
      href="https://www.unep.org/resources/report/drowning-plastics-marine-litter-and-plastic-waste-vital-graphics"&gt;400 million metric tons&lt;/a&gt; per annum—&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; plastics
      have been produced in the past 20 years than in the five decades following World War II. Short-term plastics, which include packaging, now account for about &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700782"&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of
      plastics made each year. Absent global controls, plastic production continues to trend upward; by the end of the decade, it is &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-38945-1_2"&gt;projected&lt;/a&gt; to hit 600 million metric
      tons a year, and 800 million metric tons by 2040. Plastic makers as well as the oil and gas industries, which supply plastics’ feedstocks, will likely &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-plastic-treaty-idAFL8N2UR6F9"&gt;fight&lt;/a&gt;
      production limits—especially as oil and gas companies look to plastics as a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/petrochemicals-set-to-be-the-largest-driver-of-world-oil-demand-latest-iea-analysis-finds"&gt;key area of
      growth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weak treaty would lack enforcement mechanisms and focus on technological solutions to plastic waste. Some of the technologies &lt;a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/environment-plastic-oil-recycling/"&gt;pushed&lt;/a&gt; by the industry, based on high-heat waste management, are yet &lt;a
      href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/26132/reckoning-with-the-us-role-in-global-ocean-plastic-waste"&gt;unproven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.no-burn.org/chemical-recycling-resources/"&gt;emit&lt;/a&gt; air pollutants and greenhouse gases.
      Decades of experience and recent &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba9475"&gt;modeling&lt;/a&gt;, however, have demonstrated that dealing with plastic-related pollution downstream from its source, even with a massive
      waste-infrastructure build-out, will &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba3656"&gt;not keep pace&lt;/a&gt; in the long term without policy and other interventions that limit the influx of yet more virgin plastics and related
      pollutants into the system. And the world knows how to do better. Both the &lt;a href="https://www.unep.org/ozonaction/who-we-are/about-montreal-protocol"&gt;Montreal Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses ozone-depleting pollutants, and the &lt;a
      href="https://www.mercuryconvention.org/en"&gt;Minamata Convention on Mercury&lt;/a&gt; provide &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abi9010"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; for setting progressive &lt;a
      href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c01038"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; that help nations phase out harmful materials. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/01/plastic-history-climate-change/621033/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: How bad are plastics, really? &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second key question: How should the treaty address the
      toxicity of the &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.1c00976"&gt;more than 10,000&lt;/a&gt; additives and other chemicals used in plastic production? Plastics are complex compositions, more than mere polymers. Their base
      materials are hydrocarbons, some of which are known carcinogens; finished plastics contain a mixture of chemicals—some additives, some residuals, some unintended—which can over time &lt;a
      href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.1c01512"&gt;leach&lt;/a&gt; into the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going back to the industry’s beginnings, when plastics were products of &lt;a
      href="https://www.science.org/doi/pdf/10.1126/science.abj1003"&gt;farms and forests&lt;/a&gt;, a network of toxics that served as solvent systems, processing aids, plasticizers, and more made these materials possible while also imposing health costs
      on workers. &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/12/testicular-hysteria/511793/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Carbon disulfide&lt;/a&gt;, used in hard rubber, viscose rayon, and cellophane, harmed generations of workers yet remains in
      use, notes Paul Blanc, a professor of medicine at UC San Francisco who has &lt;a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300204667/fake-silk"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; about this history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical additives in plastics have never been
      labeled, and most &lt;a href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-020-0572-5"&gt;lack&lt;/a&gt; adequate health and hazard data. But what scientists know is cause for worry. Common additives used in &lt;a
      href="https://ehjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12940-020-0572-5"&gt;food containers&lt;/a&gt; have been shown to interfere with the endocrine system, which directs human growth, fertility, and metabolism. And some plastics-associated
      chemicals are so long-lived, mobile, and toxic that they have been regulated under the UN &lt;a href="http://chm.pops.int/TheConvention/ThePOPs/ListingofPOPs/tabid/2509/Default.aspx"&gt;Stockholm Convention&lt;/a&gt;, which curbs worldwide production
      of roughly two dozen persistent pollutants. Wind, weather, and ocean currents concentrate these pollutants in the globe’s upper latitudes, a burden borne by Arctic Indigenous Peoples, whose leadership was &lt;a
      href="https://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/icc-activities/environment-sustainable-development/persistent-organic-pollutants-pops/"&gt;instrumental&lt;/a&gt; in framing the Stockholm Convention and &lt;a
      href="https://www.akaction.org/wp-content/uploads/Presentation-on-Microplastics-and-Climate-Change-for-CHE-AK-8-18-21.pdf"&gt;in calling out&lt;/a&gt; how microplastics add to that problem. The interlocking crises of climate change, toxics, and
      plastic pollution compromise both the way of life and the existence of Sivuqaq’s Yupik people, &lt;a href="https://www.adn.com/opinions/2019/09/30/were-running-out-of-time/"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a
      href="https://www.adn.com/features/alaska-news/rural-alaska/2017/05/27/st-lawrence-island-tribal-groups-tried-to-protect-walruses-now-the-animal-they-rely-on-faces-a-threat-they-cannot-control/"&gt;Delbert Pungowiyi,&lt;/a&gt; the president of the
      Native Village of Savoonga, in the &lt;em&gt;Anchorage Daily News&lt;/em&gt;. Just last year, the Stockholm Convention recognized plastic debris as a unique &lt;a href="http://chm.pops.int/Default.aspx?tabid=8747"&gt;mechanism&lt;/a&gt; for
      transporting pollutants northward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chemical additives were not included in the &lt;a
      href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/38522/k2200647_-_unep-ea-5-l-23-rev-1_-_advance.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; UNEA resolution, says David Azoulay, the director of the Environmental Health Program
      at the Center for International Environmental Law. But the terms that delegates negotiated ensured that chemicals’ toxic bearing on human health would remain within the treaty’s mandate. The negotiating committee will still, for example, take up
      supply-chain transparency, sustainable production, product design, circularity, and plastics’ impact on human well-being—all of which additives have a bearing on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third criterion for the treaty’s success will be how &lt;a
      href="https://read.aupress.ca/read/plastic-legacies/section/e36d21b5-4c7b-4ccf-ba46-d2a0df82090a"&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt; proposed plastics controls are to &lt;a
      href="https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/ngs-2020-0039/html?lang=en"&gt;localized&lt;/a&gt; needs. In some communities, plastic has become so unavoidable that scaling back its presence would create new complications. In the &lt;a
      href="https://www.no-burn.org/sachet-economy/"&gt;Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, plastics have squeezed out traditional packaging, such as &lt;a href="https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ditctedinf2021d5_en.pdf"&gt;natural fibers, glass, and
      paper&lt;/a&gt;, and vital commodities are available or affordable only in small plastic packets. In some &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X19304865"&gt;West African cities&lt;/a&gt;, sealed 500 ml plastic sachets
      are an important source of water. In subsistence economies—for example, in &lt;a href="https://www.worldwidewastejournal.com/articles/10.5334/wwwj.63/"&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;—plastic carrier bags and other containers are used and reused to purchase
      essential goods, including rice and even liquids such as oil or kerosene, in low-cost portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disability community likewise has crucial insights into what’s possible for plastics, and “can be advocates for the success of
      solutions that bring everyone along,” as the Reverend Theresa Soto, a disability-community advocate, has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/greenpeace/single-use-plastic-multi-issue-lives-ac5a286bf7e8"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;. Disability can mean that those
      who most rely on certain plastic technologies are also among the most vulnerable to plastics’ toxic implications, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jodyaroberts/status/1016792139475439616"&gt;observes&lt;/a&gt; the science and technology scholar Jody
      Roberts. He has &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09505430903557916"&gt;written&lt;/a&gt; with eloquence about the toxics-plastics nexus that is the flexible plastic feeding tube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/disposable-america/563204/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Disposable America&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These three measures
      address, in different ways, basic questions of how, what, and who. But the treaty’s success can also be judged on whether it fully acknowledges the long arc of plastics’ exploitative history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the centuries, plastics’ burdens
      have fallen inequitably over the world, &lt;a href="https://www.worldwidewastejournal.com/articles/10.5334/wwwj.63/"&gt;compounding preexisting inequities&lt;/a&gt;. Sourcing feedstocks for 19th-century plastics led to &lt;a
      href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40542850"&gt;ecological ruin and deforestation&lt;/a&gt;, violent &lt;a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/empire-of-rubber"&gt;plantation economies&lt;/a&gt;, and colonial &lt;a
      href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555803.2020.1794931"&gt;appropriation&lt;/a&gt; of indigenous lands. Across the 20th century, processing plants were overconcentrated in &lt;a
      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2399654419841063"&gt;vulnerable communities&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a

      communities&lt;/a&gt; and UN human-rights experts have flagged the &lt;a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1086172"&gt;environmental racism&lt;/a&gt; of siting yet another plastics factory in already overburdened petrochemical corridors,
      such as the Lower Mississippi Valley. Likewise, the Aamjiwnaang First Nation, who live &lt;a href="https://technopolitics.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/2013-chemical-infrastructures-in-toxicants-health-and-regulation-murphy.pdf"&gt;surrounded&lt;/a&gt;
      by Canada’s plastics and petrochemical production, have &lt;a href="https://aamjiwnaangsolidarity.org/resources/"&gt;resisted&lt;/a&gt; plastics’ unrelenting emissions and industrial expansion for decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the other end of
      plastics’ life cycle, discards have been dumped onto communities of color in the &lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/garbage-wars"&gt;U.S.&lt;/a&gt; or the global South, often on the pretext that recycling it could generate income. But
      recyclability &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/09/11/897692090/how-big-oil-misled-the-public-into-believing-plastic-would-be-recycled"&gt;proved a pipe dream&lt;/a&gt;, absent adequate infrastructure and technical and financial support to process
      a crush of mostly single-use plastics &lt;a href="https://discardstudies.com/2019/05/21/disposability/amp/"&gt;not designed for recovery&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, the very idea of disposability, even recycling, &lt;a
      href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/how-plastic-is-a-function-of-colonialism"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; the multidisciplinary plastics scholar Max Liboiron, is premised on unfettered access to land, often Indigenous land, such as for
      landfills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resolution does recognize communities who have been integral to (and yet harmed by) this system—for example, by calling out the vital work performed by &lt;a
      href="https://globalrec.org/2022/02/27/waste-ockers-unea-treaty-plastics/"&gt;20 million&lt;/a&gt; waste pickers, sorters, and recyclers, many of whom belong to marginalized groups, who reclaim much of the world’s plastic discards and have become
      experts as a result. In apprenticing with plastic-waste pickers and sorters in India, one of us, Dey, observed the highly specialized and efficient systems that waste handlers evolved to identify and classify plastics. Recyclers could bite and
      differentiate among various finer grades of low-density polyethylene. Sorters could crumple films and tell—by their sound—their polymer lattices. Their systems were far more specific than the resin-identification labels stamped onto plastics by
      manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, the mandate &lt;a href="https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/38522/k2200647_-_unep-ea-5-l-23-rev-1_-_advance.pdf?sequence=1&amp;amp;isAllowed=y"&gt;directs&lt;/a&gt; negotiators to
      consider comprehensive knowledge systems, including best-available science, traditional knowledge, and the expertise of waste workers and indigenous peoples, which in turn presents opportunities for affording rights and developing best practices to
      deal with complex plastic waste. Even more, recognizing—at a global scale—the hands and bodies that recover plastics through the day and into the night presents an opportunity to advocate for better working conditions, job security, wages, and
      dignity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are pitfalls to international negotiation—the need for consensus, compromises driven by member states and trade associations—and the response of producer nations, especially the U.S., the &lt;a
      href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/united-states-contributions-to-global-ocean-plastic-waste"&gt;largest&lt;/a&gt; contributor to plastic waste, could ultimately shape the treaty's success. The U.S. has signed other major agreements,
      including the &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/key-topics-office-of-environmental-quality-and-transboundary-issues/stockholm-convention-on-persistent-organic-pollutants/"&gt;Stockholm Convention&lt;/a&gt;, and then stopped short of ratifying them;
      this one, too, will require Congress to pass the necessary implementing legislation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than three years from now, we will find out whether the international community is up to the task the UNEA has set out. The influx of plastics
      and associated pollutants into the planetary system, &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35038861/"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; the scientists Linn Persson, Bethanie Almroth, and their colleagues, now diminishes the planet’s capacity to support life.
      And onward flow plastics through time, territories, and tissues. But if the treaty responds boldly to its mandate—if its negotiators heed history and hear the wisdom of those most intimately affected—it could offer a new vision for plastics’ place in
      society and the economy, and by extension, it could well alter the future of humanity and the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor&amp;rsquo;s Note:&lt;/em&gt; Late last year, &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; published “The Bad Guys Are Winning,” a cover story by Anne Applebaum, a staff writer who has written extensively about
      corruption and political repression in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and around the world. In response to those concerns, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee scheduled a hearing today on how the United States should combat
      authoritarianism. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine made the topic far more urgent. Senator Robert Menendez, who chairs the panel, invited Applebaum to testify. What follows, lightly edited for clarity, is her written submission
      to the committee. Some parts of this testimony have been adapted from Applebaum’s work in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of us have in our mind a cartoon image of what an autocratic state looks like. There is a
      bad man at the top. He controls the police. The police threaten the people with violence. There are evil collaborators, and maybe some brave dissidents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the 21st century, that cartoon bears little resemblance to reality.
      Nowadays, autocracies are run not by one bad guy, but by networks composed of kleptocratic financial structures, security services (military, police, paramilitary groups, surveillance personnel), and professional propagandists. The members of these
      networks are connected not only within a given country, but among many countries. The corrupt, state-controlled companies in one dictatorship do business with their counterparts in another, with the profits going to the leader and his inner circle.
      Oligarchs from multiple countries all use the same accountants and lawyers to hide their money in Europe and America. The police forces in one country can arm, equip, and train the police forces in another; China notoriously sells surveillance
      technology all around the world. Propagandists share resources and tactics—the Russian troll farms that promote Putin’s propaganda can also be used to promote the propaganda of Belarus or Venezuela. They also pound home the same messages about the
      weakness of democracy and the evil of America. Chinese sources are right now echoing fake Russian stories about nonexistent Ukrainian chemical weapons. Their goal is to launch false narratives and confuse audiences in the United States and other free
      societies. They do so in order to make us believe that there is nothing we can do in response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that there is a conspiracy—some super-secret room where bad guys meet, as in a James Bond movie. The new autocratic
      alliance doesn’t have a structure, let alone an ideology. Among modern autocrats are people who call themselves communists, nationalists, and theocrats. Washington likes to talk about China and Chinese influence because that’s easy, but what really
      links the leaders of these countries is a common desire to preserve their personal power. Unlike military or political alliances from other times and places, the members of this group don’t operate like a bloc, but rather like a loose agglomeration
      of companies. Call it Autocracy, Inc. Their links are cemented not by ideals but by deals—deals designed to replace Western sanctions or take the edge off Western economic boycotts, or to make them personally rich—which is why they can operate across
      geographical and historical lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/what-if-world-war-iii-has-already-started/627054/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Veronika
      Melkozerova: The Western world is in denial&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They protect one another and look after one another. In theory, for example, Venezuela is an international pariah. Since 2019, U.S. citizens and U.S. companies have
      been forbidden to do any business there; Canada, the European Union, and many of Venezuela’s South American neighbors continue to increase sanctions on the country. And yet Venezuela receives loans as well as oil investment from Moscow and Beijing.
      Turkey &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47092784"&gt;facilitates the illicit Venezuelan gold trade&lt;/a&gt;. Cuba has long provided security advisers, as well as security technology, to Venezuela’s rulers. The international
      narcotics trade keeps individual members of the regime well supplied with designer shoes and handbags. Leopoldo López, a onetime star of the opposition now living in exile in Spain, observes that although Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro’s
      opponents have received some foreign assistance, it’s a drop in the bucket, “nothing comparable with what Maduro has received.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of this new challenge, Western and American responses have been profoundly inadequate.
      Expressions of “deep concern” mean nothing to dictators who feel secure thanks to their high levels of surveillance and their personal wealth. Western sanctions alone have no impact on autocrats who know they can continue to trade with one another.
      As the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/?utm_source=feed"&gt;war in Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; illustrates, our failure to use military deterrence had consequences. Russia did not believe that we would arm Ukraine
      because we had not done so in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of these reasons, we need a completely new strategy toward Russia, China, and the rest of the autocratic world, one in which we don’t merely react to the latest outrage, but change the
      rules of engagement altogether. We cannot merely slap sanctions on foreign oligarchs following some violation of international law, or our own laws: We must alter our financial system so that we stop kleptocratic elites from abusing it in the first
      place. We cannot just respond with furious fact-checking and denials when autocrats produce blatant propaganda: We must help provide accurate and timely information where there is none, and deliver it in the languages people speak. We cannot rely on
      old ideas about the liberal world order, the inviolability of borders, or international institutions and treaties to protect our friends and allies: We need a military strategy, based in deterrence, that takes into account the real possibility that
      autocracies will use military force.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war in Ukraine has been launched because we did not do any of these things in the past. As he was preparing for this conflict, the Russian president calculated that the cost of international
      criticism, sanctions, and military resistance would be very low. He would survive them. Past Russian invasions of Ukraine and Georgia; Russian assassinations carried out in Britain and Germany; Russian disinformation campaigns during democratic
      elections in America, France, Germany, and elsewhere; Russian support for extremist or anti-democratic politicians—none of this received any real response from us or from the democratic alliances that we lead. Vladimir Putin assumed, based on his own
      experience, that we would not react this time either. China, Belarus, and other Russian allies assumed the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going forward, we cannot let this happen again. In my written testimony I will suggest some broad areas where we need
      to completely reimagine our policy. I will leave the necessary changes in military and intelligence strategy, especially the question of deterrence, to others who have more expertise in this area, and will focus on kleptocracy and disinformation. But
      I hope this hearing sparks a broader conversation. We need far more creative thinking about how we can not just survive the war in Ukraine, but win the war in Ukraine—and how we can prevent similar wars from taking place in the
      future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. Put an end to transnational kleptocracy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently a Russian, Angolan, or Chinese oligarch can own a house in London, an estate on the Mediterranean, a company in
      Delaware, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/how-south-dakota-became-haven-dirty-money/620298/?utm_source=feed"&gt;trust in South Dakota&lt;/a&gt; without ever having to reveal to his own tax authorities or ours that
      these properties are his. A whole host of American and European intermediaries make these kinds of transactions possible: lawyers, bankers, accountants, real-estate agents, PR companies. Their work is legal. We have made it so. We can just as easily
      make it illegal. All of it. We don’t need to tolerate a little bit of corruption; we can simply end the whole system, altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/how-south-dakota-became-haven-dirty-money/620298/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Casey Michel: The United States of dirty money&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this testimony is being
      presented to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which does not traditionally have oversight of the regulation of international finance, it is time to recognize the problem of international kleptocracy as a matter not just for the Treasury, but
      for those who make American foreign policy. After all, many modern autocrats hold on to power not just with violence, but by stealing from their own countries, laundering the money abroad, and then using their fortunes to maintain power at home and
      buy influence abroad. The Russian oligarchs in the news at the moment are not just wealthy men with yachts; they have been acting for many years as agents of the Russian state, representing the interests of the Russian leadership in myriad commercial
      and political transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have the power to destroy this business model. We could require all real-estate transactions, everywhere in the United States, to be totally transparent. We could require all companies, trusts, and
      investment funds to be registered in the name of their real owners. We could ban Americans from keeping their money in tax havens, and we could ban American lawyers and accountants from engaging with tax havens. We could force art dealers and auction
      houses to carry out money-laundering checks, and close loopholes that allow anonymity in the private-equity and hedge-fund industries. We could launch a diplomatic crusade to persuade other democracies to do the same. Simply ending these practices
      would make life much more uncomfortable for the world’s kleptocrats. It might have the benefit of making our own country more law-abiding, and freer of autocratic influence, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to changing the law, we also need to
      jail those who break it. We need to step up our enforcement of the existing money-laundering laws. It is not enough to sanction Russian oligarchs now, when it is too late, or to investigate their enablers, when it is too late for that too. We need to
      prevent new kleptocratic elites from forming in the future. It must become not only socially toxic but also a criminal liability for anyone to handle stolen money, and not just in America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now is the time to organize a deep
      international conversation, with our allies all over the world, to assess what they are doing, whether they are succeeding, and which steps we all need to take to ensure that we are not building the autocracies of the future. Now is the time to
      reveal what we know about hidden money and who really controls it. The Biden administration has created a precedent, revealing intelligence leading up to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Why not build on that precedent, and reveal what intelligence
      we have about Putin’s money, Maduro’s money, Xi Jinping’s money, or &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/belarus-lukashenko-hijack-plane-precedent-dictators/618971/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Alexander Lukashenko’s&lt;/a&gt;
      money?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as we once built an international anti-communist alliance, so we can build an international anti-corruption alliance, organized around the idea of transparency, accountability, and fairness. Those are the values that we
      should promote, not only at home but around the world. They are consistent with our democratic constitutions and with the rule of law that underlies all of our societies. Once again: Our failure to abide by those values in the past is one of the
      sources of today’s crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;2. Don’t fight the information war. Undermine it.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern autocrats take information and ideas seriously. They understand the importance not only of
      controlling opinion inside their own countries, but also of influencing debates around the world. They spend accordingly: on television channels, local and national newspapers, bot networks. They buy officials and businessmen in democratic countries
      in order to have local spokesmen and advocates. China’s United Front program also targets students, younger journalists, and politicians, seeking to influence their thinking from an early age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For three decades, since the end of the
      Cold War, we have been pretending that we don’t have to do any of this, because good information will somehow win the battle in the “market of ideas.” But there isn’t a market of ideas—or not a free market. Instead, some ideas have been turbocharged
      by disinformation campaigns, by heavy spending, and by the social-media algorithms that promote emotional and divisive content because that’s what keeps people online. Since we first encountered Russian disinformation inside our own society, we’ve
      also imagined that our existing forms of communication could beat it without any special effort. But a decade’s worth of studying Russian propaganda has taught me that fact-checking and swift reactions are useful but
      insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have a living example of how this works, right in front of us now. We can see how the Ukrainians are getting their viewpoint across by telling a moving, true story, by speaking in language used by ordinary people
      and by showing us the war as they see it. In doing so, they are reaching Americans, Europeans, and many others. But at the same time, the false Russian narrative is the only one reaching Russians at home; it is also reaching many people in the
      broader Russian-speaking world, as well as in India and the Middle East. The same is true of Chinese propaganda, which might not work here but has a strong impact in the developing world, where China presents its political system as a model for
      others to follow. Right now, for example, private technology groups there, including Tencent, Sina Weibo, and ByteDance, are &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d460c6f6-ffc7-4d61-9350-bef378fcc5c5"&gt;promoting content&lt;/a&gt; backing Putin’s
      war and suppressing posts that are sympathetic to Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new atmosphere, we need to rethink how we communicate. Much as we assembled the Department of Homeland Security out of disparate agencies after 9/11, we now need a
      much more carefully targeted effort that would pull together some of the departments in the U.S. government that think about communication, not to do propaganda but to reach more people around the world with better information. The building blocks
      already exist, even if they are not currently coordinated. All of these things belong together: U.S.-funded international broadcasting, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Voice of America, and the rest of the services now housed at the
      U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM); the Global Engagement Center, currently in the State Department; the Open Source Center, a large media monitoring and translation service currently squirreled away in the intelligence community where its work is
      hard to access; research into foreign audiences and internet tactics; public diplomacy and cultural diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams who work on these things should be jointly thinking about the best way to communicate democratic values in
      undemocratic places, jointly sharing experiences, jointly informing and engaging other parts of the U.S. government. In any given country there are different kinds of audiences and there may be different tools and tactics needed to reach them. Parts
      of the U.S. government may have thought about this problem, but others have not. The dysfunction and scandal that have dogged international broadcasting—with Michael Pack’s &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/voice-america-will-sound-like-trump/613321/?utm_source=feed"&gt;disastrous tenure at USAGM&lt;/a&gt; as only the latest example—need to end. Congressional leadership is needed to put these
      services on a different and better footing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of what we should do is simply provide more and better information to people who want it. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s online performance increased by 99 percent during the first
      two weeks of war in Ukraine. Viewership of YouTube videos of RFE/RL programming tripled. This proves the value of communicating with Russian speakers all over Eurasia—Ukraine, Moldova, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Baltic States, even Germany, home to
      some 3 million native Russian speakers. But small increases in funding for this vital population are insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need to provide real, long-lasting competition for the Russian state-run cable and satellite television that most
      of the people in these regions watch. Hundreds of talented Russian journalists and media professionals have just fled Moscow: Why not start a Russian television channel, perhaps jointly funded by Europe and America, to employ them and give them a way
      to work? At the same time, we should increase funding for existing Russian independent media outlets, most now expelled from the country, and provide support for the many grassroots efforts to run social-media campaigns inside and outside the
      country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But although Russia is of special interest at the moment, we also need to consider, as Congress is already doing, an expansion of funding for Radio Free Asia, which has received only a third of the funding of RFE/RL,
      despite its potential to reach a large audience inside China and the Chinese diaspora around the world. Although relatively small, Radio Free Asia was the first news organization to uncover mass detentions in Xinjiang; RFA also provided the first
      documentation of China’s cover-up of the earliest coronavirus fatalities in Wuhan. We need RFA to be able to counter Chinese propaganda; to put China’s Belt and Road projects in Southeast Asia into context for audiences in Cambodia, Laos, Burma, and
      Vietnam; to enhance its digital global initiative to engage younger, Mandarin-speaking audiences wary of Beijing’s dominant media narratives. We also need to scale up the work of the Open Technology Fund, which &lt;a
      href="https://www.opentech.fund/funds/internet-freedom-fund/"&gt;supports internet-freedom technologies&lt;/a&gt; at every stage of development. OTF makes it possible for millions to access independent journalism in closed media
      environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all of the foreign languages that we work, we need to shift from an era of bullhorn digital broadcasting to a new era of &lt;i&gt;“&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.ft.com/content/35baa200-59e9-4238-b2c2-049375bdd541"&gt;digital samizdat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;,”&lt;/i&gt; mobilizing informed citizens and teaching them to distribute information. These tactics may not get to everyone, but they can be
      targeted at younger audiences, diasporas, and elites who have influence within their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new era, funding for education and culture need some rethinking too. Shouldn’t there be a Russian-language university, in
      Vilnius or Warsaw, to house all of the intellectuals and thinkers who have just left Moscow? Don’t we need to spend more on education in Hindi and Persian? Existing programs should be recast and redesigned for a different era, one in which so much
      more can be known about the world, but in which so much money is being spent by the autocracies to distort that knowledge. The goal should be to ensure that a different idea of “Russianness” is available to the Russian diaspora, aside from the one
      provided by Putin, and that alternative outlets are available for people in other autocratic societies as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;3. Put democracy back at the center of foreign policy. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is no
      accident that Americans are united in their support for Ukraine. A large, bipartisan majority, for example, &lt;a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/four-five-americans-support-end-us-imports-russian-energy-reutersipsos-2022-03-08/"&gt;backs&lt;/a&gt; the U.S. decision to boycott Russian oil, even if it led to higher prices. This is because Americans
      identify with people who are clearly fighting for their freedom, their independence, and their democracy. It is a central part of how we define ourselves, and who we are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/ben-rhodes-alexey-navalny-maria-stepanova/627049/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Ben Rhodes: We have reached a hinge point in history&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recognize that it is naive to
      assume we can have the same policy toward every dictator, that we cannot give the same support to every democracy movement; I understand that there are trade-offs to make in diplomacy as in everything else. This is not the Cold War, there is no
      Warsaw Pact, and not every judgment about every autocracy is black-and-white. But our preference for democracy and our willingness to defend key democracies should never be in doubt. The fact is that Russians clearly doubted whether we and our allies
      were even willing to help Ukraine fight back. We failed, in advance, to telegraph the fact that we would. We cannot let that happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a historian and journalist, I am also on the board of the National
      Endowment for Democracy (NED), the independent organization that Congress has generously funded for years. I want to express here my thanks for that support, as well as my hope that it will continue. NED is ahead of the curve in its thinking about
      these issues, has supported networks of journalists to help in international investigations of kleptocracy as well as independent journalism of all kinds, on top of its support for democracy activism all over the world. Funding NED is necessary but
      not sufficient, however. U.S. foreign policy is in fact made by dozens of different actors, all across the government and American society. Congressional leadership can help focus all of them not just on the defense of existing institutions, but on
      the creative thinking we lack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, we need to be able to imagine a different kind of future, one in which our nation and its ideas are not in retreat, but in the ascendance. We need to approach displaced diasporas all
      over the world as an opportunity, not a burden: How can we prepare them to take back the countries that they have lost, in Syria, Afghanistan, or Russia? We need to break the links among autocracies, to forge new and better links between democracies,
      to reinvent existing international institutions that are no longer fit for purpose. It is alarming, even astonishing, that the United Nations has played no role in preventing or mitigating the war in Ukraine because Russia, as a Security Council
      member, has so successfully blocked it from doing so. In fact, Russia and China have been seeking for years to undermine the UN and all of the other international organizations that conventional wisdom said would promote human rights and prevent
      exactly the kind of unprovoked war that we are seeing unfold today. It may be time to create some alternatives, to think about how the democratic world can organize alternatives, in the event that the UN is no longer interested in pursuing peaceful
      development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, it’s extremely important that we imagine a different future for Ukraine. A victory in this conflict, whatever that means—a Russian retreat or a negotiated settlement following Russia’s failure to conquer the
      country—would provide an enormous, transformational boost in confidence to the entire democratic world, including to the democratic activists in Belarus and Ukraine who oppose the war, even to democratic activists in places as far away as Hong Kong,
      Burma, or Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A defeat, defined as the end of Ukrainian sovereignty, would be a terrible blow to all of them. The consequences are much higher than most in Congress and the administration seem to have yet acknowledged.
      Ukraine is not in NATO, but it is a de facto member of the European world and the democratic world. Ukrainian failure will have an impact on NATO’s credibility and on the democratic world’s cohesion, whether we like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
      need to think about victory, and how to achieve it, not only in this conflict but in the others to come, over the next years and decades.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since 2016, more than 50,000 structures in California have been destroyed by wildfire. During fire season in the West, when the sky is dim with smoke and the sun’s an eerie red, you might find yourself breathing in tiny
      carbonized particles of what used to be someone’s front-porch swing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These fires are only going to get worse as the climate warms. Unless we want to keep risking lives and inhaling incinerated dreams, something has to
      change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California Department of Insurance last month &lt;a href="http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0400-news/0100-press-releases/2022/release019-2022.cfm"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; new regulations that require
      insurance companies to reward homeowners who take steps to &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/08/california-defensible-space-fire-laws/619685/?utm_source=feed"&gt;protect their home from wildfire&lt;/a&gt;, such as clearing
      brush and trees from the immediate vicinity of their home or putting on a fire-resistant roof. The policy is being widely praised. But it raises a broader question: As climate risks to our property, our livelihoods, and our lives mount, to what
      extent should we cushion the blow of these dangers, and is there a limit to how much, or how long, we pay? Is there a point where protecting people from risk begets more risk?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California makes a good case study
      because it leads the nation in both annual number and extent of wildfires. Climate change—no surprise—is &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/most-important-number-for-the-wests-wildfires-california/616359/?utm_source=feed"&gt;making things much worse&lt;/a&gt;. Eighteen of the 20 largest fires in California history have happened
      since the turn of the millennium—12 of them since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Bove, a meteorologist and the senior vice president of natural-catastrophe solutions for Munich Reinsurance America, told me that the
      California-wildfire situation was rocking the insurance industry. “We are trying to figure out this new landscape along with everybody else,” he said. “All the premium earned over three decades of writing business was gone in the wine-country and
      Camp fires.” One estimate, from the actuarial firm Milliman, penciled out that two years of fires undid 26 years of profits for the state’s insurers. (Insurers themselves, though, were insulated in part from these losses by their own
      reinsurance.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insurance companies are prohibited by state law from using models of future conditions to set their rates, but with the fires of the past five or so years, even backwards-looking risk calculations
      are beginning to prompt insurers to raise rates or refuse to renew policies. Some areas are becoming so risky that insurance companies simply won’t sell policies there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/west-coast-fires-are-making-me-claustrophobic/616252/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The West has never felt so small&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 32 states, rejected homeowners can
      always get coverage through programs known as FAIR plans—insurance pools run collectively by every company offering homeowner’s insurance in the state. The companies are legally required to participate and split any losses. A FAIR plan must insure
      everyone—no matter where a house is built—though their policies tend to cover only the most catastrophic losses. The number of Californians insured under the state’s FAIR plan in 2020 was 241,466. That’s 2.7 percent of the state’s homeowners, up from
      1.7 percent in 2015. The percentage is expected to be even higher for 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more and more homeowners in fire-prone areas migrate to these stopgap plans, a “FAIR plan is gradually ceasing to be just a temporary
      solution,” according to an analysis by Devika Hazra and Patricia Gallagher, economists at California State University in Los Angeles. And their &lt;a
      href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264999322000141?casa_token=lBOn-w-INgEAAAAA:5tnd0ntJ6ydI3ZJWqT50HuQrD4xJpRxDd7B_83GPDkzall5odbWFULktIPa11E4ML70vcoPCwAo"&gt;March 2022 paper&lt;/a&gt; shows that FAIR-plan premiums in Los
      Angeles County simply do not reflect the real risk—they are more influenced by factors such as the bed-to-bath ratio of a house than how likely it is to go up in flames.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These policies send an unrealistic message
      to homeowners about how much risk they are taking on. The premiums look normal, so it feels normal to live there. Homeowners don’t hear “Your house is so likely to burn that it is uninsurable.” In that way, a FAIR plan is “a form of lying to the
      public,” according to Abrahm Lustgarten, an investigative journalist at ProPublica who is currently writing a book on &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/15/magazine/climate-crisis-migration-america.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article"&gt;climate migration&lt;/a&gt; in the United
      States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hazra and Gallagher recommend that insurers be allowed to set rates that reflect the real risk, based on climate models. But they know that the rich, who can afford the premiums or absorb the losses, will
      simply shrug and build anyway, while the poor will be squeezed at a time when housing in less risky parts of the American West—like coastal cities—is almost comically unaffordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who live in the “wildland
      urban interface,” or WUI, are a socioeconomic mix. Second homes and mansions with lovely views are built next to tracts of housing aimed at people who can’t afford the city center and are forced to “drive until they qualify.” The result is the
      “intermingling of two different crises,” Hazda says—“the wildfire crisis and the housing crisis in L.A.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/how-bad-will-climate-change-get/620605/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: We’re heading straight for a demi-armageddon&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Making the FAIR plan more expensive, you
      are going to end up punishing a bunch of other folks that have no other option and are at risk of defaulting on their mortgage,” the environmental-policy expert Matt Auer, from the University of Georgia, told me. If people are exposing themselves to
      risk simply because they want to, using insurance policy to make it expensive or impossible to do so sounds like a great idea. But when people are moving to risky areas out of necessity, the same policies could instead seem
      cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to try to thread the needle would be to limit FAIR-plan coverage to primary residences, or to charge extra for coverage on second homes. Another would be to structure premium rates into tiers, like
      progressive taxes, so that the most extravagant homes in the WUI subsidize protection for low-income housing. California could also consider providing the FAIR-plan option only for existing housing stock—a policy that might freeze new construction in
      some areas. Each of these options could help. But the galaxy-brain solution might just be to provide lots of affordable housing options in the urban core.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advocates for affordable housing, including Sonja Trauss,
      the executive director of Yes in My Back Yard, which is based in San Francisco, are beginning to explicitly argue that increased urban density can mitigate climate change, and wildfire risk. More affordable housing in the city will reduce the number
      of people moving outward into the WUI for economic reasons. And it can provide a landing place for those moving back in. “There are probably places that are too dangerous to live,” Trauss says. She supports gradual voluntary buyouts of some of these
      riskiest zones. But, she adds, “there has to be some place for people to go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lustgarten’s research, too, suggests that to avoid repeated catastrophic losses of property and life, “our communities should become
      more dense and should pull back a little bit from wildland interface areas.” But Lustgarten realizes that not everyone can leave, or will want to. So we’ll also need to “invest heavily in building better, more resilient structures” and manage
      landscapes better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the West’s most flammable landscapes are deeply meaningful to people who are connected to the place they live by livelihood or cultural community. The WUI is cluttered with ticky-tacky
      homes banged up to cream profits off the &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/01/when-good-time-buy-house/621409/?utm_source=feed"&gt;bonkers housing market&lt;/a&gt;, but where the city grades into the country, you can also
      find tribal homelands, little towns that have been there for generations, working forests, and cattle ranches—places that would break your heart to leave if you were from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staying means rethinking how we
      pool risk. Our modern insurance system rests on contracts between individuals and businesses, but Matt Auer has &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11625-021-01024-8"&gt;studied&lt;/a&gt; cases where communities took on collective
      hardening actions—cleaning up fuels that encircle whole neighborhoods, sending a free truck around to remove woody debris from yards, ensuring enough water is available for firefighters when they crack open a hydrant. He found that successful
      community-fire-protection plans tended to involve “collaborations between different levels of government and with non-state actors,” including nonprofits and homeowners’ associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Bove, from Munich
      Reinsurance, said that community-level insurance pools and community action to reduce fire risk are the hot new trends in the insurance industry. “In California, a home could be one meter from the property line and your neighbor’s house can be one
      meter from the property line, which means the house is six feet away. You can have house-to-house spread. You can’t just look at this at the individual house level. You need the whole community looking at
      this.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California’s new mandatory insurance discounts for hardening do include provisions for “community-level mitigation efforts,” such as “driveway and roadway widths that facilitate evacuations and firefighting
      efforts, and a community-wide landscape and vegetation plan that is approved by the local fire district.” In some ways this new focus on community-level action springs from the same premise as insurance itself, the for-profit version of which evolved
      in the Middle Ages from a preexisting landscape of religious societies, social clubs, guilds, and other groups that practiced mutual aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a 1601 English insurance act puts it, “the loss lighteth rather easily
      upon many than heavily upon few.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you’ve stood on the right block in the Golden Triangle district of Washington, D.C., or inside the Loop in Chicago, or in San Francisco’s Financial District at 9 a.m. on any recent weekday, you might have experienced
      the creepy feeling that you had missed the Rapture and been left behind. America’s downtowns have not recovered from COVID-19, and they won’t—at least not to what they were before the pandemic hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For two years, federal dollars
      have buoyed local governments, transit agencies, and downtown businesses. But as we enter the third year of the pandemic, we can see that more fundamental change is needed. The public and private entities that depend on downtown money are going to
      need a path to a new normal. This future will require plenty of office workers—but also more residents, shoppers, visitors, tourists, students, and seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People will still work in offices in cities. Though Gallup &lt;a
      href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355907/remote-work-persisting-trending-permanent.aspx"&gt;estimates&lt;/a&gt; that just over half of U.S. workers went fully remote when the pandemic first arrived in March 2020, that share has gradually declined to
      one-quarter today. In the long run, a significant number of these remote workers will remain &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/work-from-home-benefits/619597/?utm_source=feed"&gt;fully online&lt;/a&gt;. However, Gallup’s
      polling and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-28/remote-work-seen-more-persistent-than-u-s-city-planners-expect"&gt;many other surveys and studies&lt;/a&gt; have found that a majority of these workers prefer a hybrid model
      with some in-person work, and that remote workers’ preferences and productivity &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/business/remote-work-office-life.html"&gt;vary greatly&lt;/a&gt; by sector, age, gender, and race. The share of workers who
      wish to be fully remote for their entire career is likely small, and this share may further shrink as even more workers return to the office, which may entice more of their colleagues to come back too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/09/work-from-home-numbers/620107/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: Another truth about remote work&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But
      even though the percentage of workers who will remain fully remote is relatively small, a big majority of office workers will likely be partly remote for the long haul. That has significant implications for employers and cities. Every owner or user
      of an office building is going to end up either paying the same or more for less usage of space or reconfiguring to use fewer square feet per worker. It’s just a matter of time before every U.S. office market gets in on the &lt;a
      href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/the-nature-of-office-work-is-shifting-and-so-must-downtowns/"&gt;trend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what should the new office look like? For office buildings, employers and landlords can search for &lt;a
      href="https://hbr.org/2022/01/design-an-office-that-people-want-to-come-back-to"&gt;inspiration&lt;/a&gt; in all of the “&lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2016/09/14/third-places-as-community-builders/"&gt;third places&lt;/a&gt;”
      (not home, not the office) where we know people like to do independent work: libraries, campuses, and coffee shops. They can also provide appropriate facilities for convening and collaboration. Workers can acknowledge that employers need them in
      person for &lt;a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/redesigning-the-post-pandemic-workplace/"&gt;culture building&lt;/a&gt; and the sharing of &lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2007/07/the-knowledge-creating-company"&gt;tacit knowledge&lt;/a&gt;—the
      kind of information that is hard to write down in a document or learn from reading, and that boosts collaboration and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employers can also provide for workers some of the &lt;a
      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-13/how-to-design-an-office-for-a-hybrid-work-future"&gt;homelike features&lt;/a&gt; that have preserved productivity and supported resilience over the past two years: comfort (e.g., furniture and
      dress code) and care (e.g., food and personalization). Commercial-real-estate innovators such as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/09/why-wework-was-destined-fail/598891/?utm_source=feed"&gt;WeWork&lt;/a&gt;, which have
      mainstreamed new leasing models and floor plans that make it easy for not just multiple workers but multiple employers to share space, have already figured a lot of this out, and will continue to push the boundaries of what works. And watch for other
      start-ups to emerge that offer other office-space models that are even more appealing to a wider range of employers in an age of hybrid work. The bottom line is that workers want to get out of their homes, but they &lt;a
      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-01/return-to-office-employees-are-quitting-instead-of-giving-up-work-from-home"&gt;absolutely do not&lt;/a&gt; want to return to the old office. In a tight labor market, mandating “return to work”
      in sterile, stale offices will produce costs to recruitment and retention that should be weighed against the costs of modernization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While employers rethink office buildings on the micro scale, cities and regions need to grapple
      with how to efficiently use their &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/to-recover-from-covid-19-downtowns-must-adapt/"&gt;office-dominated&lt;/a&gt; downtowns, which are their most central and easy-to-access places. They also need to
      consider what to do about the ecosystem of businesses, residents, and infrastructure that depends on hundreds of thousands of people surging into them every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;America’s downtowns can go hybrid too. In public spaces and
      rights-of-way, that means fully committing to &lt;a href="https://nacto.org/publication/streets-for-pandemic-response-recovery"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; cities &lt;a
      href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2020/09/03/ten-cities-to-use-open-streets-as-tools-for-equity-and-covid-resilience/"&gt;adapted streets&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic to create more outdoor room, reallocating space from storing and moving cars &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/cars-will-take-streets-back-unless-cities-act-quickly/618615/?utm_source=feed"&gt;to gathering people&lt;/a&gt;. Changing land use—such as mixing in other kinds of buildings with offices—will
      take more time and money, but is equally necessary and doable. Cities must get to work evaluating the policy frameworks that guide construction—zoning, permitting, building codes, tax codes and incentives, and more—to ease the conversion of obsolete
      office buildings into things we do need, such as housing, schools, and care facilities. There is also a huge amount of pent-up demand for things and experiences we &lt;i&gt;want&lt;/i&gt;. Concerts are &lt;a
      href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/concert-sales-are-reaching-record-levels-despite-surging-delta-variant-n1275899"&gt;selling out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a
      href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/levitt-pavilion-had-a-rocking-year-2021-attendance-highest-of-first-three-years/JPMS6HZVHRFEPICKLYPLCRFSGI/"&gt;events&lt;/a&gt; and street festivals are &lt;a
      href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/538581/diners-strike-out-at-redeye-night-market-swarm-downtown-restaurants/"&gt;packed&lt;/a&gt;, and in-person shopping is &lt;a
      href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA"&gt;recovering&lt;/a&gt; from its pandemic collapse. Let’s bring all this activity downtown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some employers and cities may hope to duck this challenge by mandating a return to the
      2019 baseline from their own workforces. Both are reluctant to invest in big, structural policy or capital changes after navigating two years of uncertainty and anticipating more to come. This is a short-term perspective that overlooks that hybrid
      work was becoming more popular even before the pandemic, and is certainly here to stay now. Avoiding action renders both cities and firms vulnerable to being outmaneuvered by smaller, more agile competitors. And it’s also instinctively off-putting to
      workers who have experienced trauma and transformation over the past two years, making the idea of “going back” to anything, much less the old office, pretty unappealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/08/magazine-wall-office-return/619636/?utm_source=feed"&gt;Read: The most surreal aspect of returning to the office &lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For cities, hoping to return to the old
      normal also misses an opportunity to solve multiple problems with one solution. The people and places hurt by the pandemic can help one another recover. Downtowns are incredibly valuable assets that cities can leverage to meet the structural needs of
      people left behind after federal aid is spent. Bold cities are forging strong downtowns with a more diverse mix of buildings and activities whose prosperity is co-invested with that of the rest of the city. In Chicago, increased development
      entitlements in downtown areas are linked to &lt;a href="https://neighborhoodopportunityfund.com/"&gt;neighborhood commercial-corridor revitalization&lt;/a&gt;, while Seattle is investing in &lt;a
      href="https://www.kingcounty.gov/services/environment/stewardship/sustainable-building/transfer-development-rights.aspx"&gt;open-space preservation&lt;/a&gt; and New York will use &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/29/nyregion/nyc-congestion-pricing.html"&gt;congestion pricing to improve transit&lt;/a&gt;. Such reforms can both energize downtowns and expand their moral, political, and geographic relevance far beyond the
      pandemic era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a time of great isolation and division, can we reach for a scenario in which everyone wins? Both businesses and employees, service and essential workers and white-collar ones, and suburbs and cities can benefit
      from reconnecting downtown. Being present, face-to-face, has value. And downtowns are still the most highly accessible locations in their regions, even after decades of suburbanization. These fundamentals remain strong. Now imagine office buildings
      and their districts rethought, rearranged, and redeployed in a way that is not just functional, but also delightful, educational, accommodating, and accessible, not just to workers as producers, but to workers as whole people and to their families,
      including both children and elders. We can all meet there.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;n 2010&lt;/span&gt;, Jennifer Egan published &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/books/a-visit-from-the-goon-squad/9780307477477"&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Visit From the Goon
      Squad&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The novel won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award, suggesting esteem among populists and highbrows alike. Commentators praised its combination of technical virtuosity—the intricate cogs and wheels
      that connected plotlines across time and geography—and sentimental “heart,” a wistful emotional atmosphere piped in like a gas to keep the mechanism from rusting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder"
      data-source="magazine-issue"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Racing back and forth in time (between the 1970s and the 2020s), the book found its center in the chastened view from middle age. The chapters took the protagonists from their 40s—when they were
      already in decline after appearing on the culture’s radar as moguls, musicians, publicists, journalists influential in the recording industry—to their hopeful beginnings in high-school-band rehearsals and college-dorm musings. The effect was to
      accentuate the melancholic gap between ambition and actuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The puzzle-box precision in the ordering of chapters—and the narrative medley, varying past and present tense, first and third and even second person—turned an ordinary
      generational portrait into a mosaic. Glimpses of the main action through the eyes of minor characters (some deranged, some children) supplied the glue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The approach called out for thematic justification, and the literary techniques
      suggested technologies of the moment. Egan’s epigraph was from Proust, but &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad &lt;/i&gt;proposed Google and Facebook as inspiration, and “the wish-fulfillment fantasy these portals offer: &lt;i&gt;What ever happened to … ?
      &lt;/i&gt;” Meanwhile, at the edges of scenes, surveillance cameras, the internet, &lt;a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/94180/september-11-the-novel-turns-inward"&gt;post-9/11 national-security paranoia&lt;/a&gt;—the invasions of public
      recording—were at work unsettling the realm of private recording: the intimate pop-music soundtracks of individuals’ lives. &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt; seemed to promise deeper significance because the novel was also reading the
      news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egan bills her new book, &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781476716763"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Candy House&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as a “&lt;a href="https://about.simonandschuster.biz/news/jennifer-egan-candy-house/"&gt;sibling
      novel&lt;/a&gt;,” a curious bit of nomenclature. It seems to mean that she trundles out &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad &lt;/i&gt;’s methods to try them again. Calling it a sequel is more accurate; at least I can’t imagine rewards to its readers that don’t
      include renewing acquaintances with old friends. Here, in chapters that span roughly the 2010s to the 2030s, Egan unspools subsequent events in the lives of &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Goon Squad &lt;/i&gt;’s principals—the record executive
      Bennie Salazar; his mentee, Sasha Blake; and his mentor, Lou Kline (the original three generations)—accoutered with spouses and innumerable unhappy offspring. Egan continues to incorporate each generation’s peer groups from school and work, and now
      we see the youngest children as adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratcheting up the technology, &lt;i&gt;The Candy House&lt;/i&gt; fully embraces a science-fiction conceit, and implies that some of Egan’s minor &lt;i&gt;Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt; characters not
      only invented social media and seized control of music streaming, but have made good on a new technology, Own Your Unconscious, which uploads the totality of each participant’s memories to the cloud. It includes a Collective Consciousness feature
      that allows users access to others’ recollections, and some chapters are presented as the product of consulting “gray grabs” from multiple recorded minds—yet they read like ordinary third-person narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      data-id="injected-recirculation-link"&gt;&lt;i&gt;[&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/jennifer-egan-manhattan-beach/540612/?utm_source=feed"&gt;From the November 2017 issue: Jennifer Egan’s surprising swerve into
      historical fiction&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egan makes no use of the further innovations, and &lt;i&gt;Rashomon&lt;/i&gt;-style effects, that such a capacity would seem to enable, and that even the simplest sci-fi novel would explore.
      Surely the experience of entering another person’s consciousness, or multiple consciousnesses separately experiencing the same event, poses questions: Do all thoughts and memories speak the same language? Do you behave differently, knowing that
      everything you think can be recovered? Not addressed. The invention amounts to a new plot point, not a fictional evolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But something big has changed in the characters’ fates. This time, we keep company with a cast of winners,
      superspies, Special Ops assassins, and world-historical gatekeepers. Gone are the poignant emotional swerves and empathy for sad sacks elicited by &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;. A journey that had seemed bittersweet, plaintive, familiar yet
      refreshed by Egan’s singularly convoluted narrative construction—like jazz standards burnished with brilliant arrangements—now sounds depthlessly manic, like sped-up Muzak. It’s as though Egan’s ingenious technique has been streamlined for short
      attention spans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;Egan’s feat &lt;/span&gt;in &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt; was to have worked out a contemporary means of reconstructing slimmed-down, swiftly moving “&lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/03/mfa-creative-writing/462483/?utm_source=feed"&gt;M.F.A. fiction&lt;/a&gt;” to provide jolts of very rare, very special narrative effects, almost exclusively available in very long
      traditional novels. And she proved she could do this in chapter after chapter, each one sculpted like a crisp short story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unique pleasures delivered in long books are unforgettable enough that every reader will likely have his
      own catalog, and some instances are quite famous. One pleasure arises when a forgotten minor character returns unexpectedly to divert the plot, years after his role seemed at an end. (It happens memorably in different volumes of Balzac’s &lt;a
      href="https://bookshop.org/books/the-human-comedy-selected-stories/9781590176641"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Human Comedy&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as in &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780140442373"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Black
      Sheep&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, when the belligerent brother, Philippe, returns to foil the new bully menacing our hero.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another occurs when a protagonist absorbs an antagonist’s understanding of an event long after its reality seemed
      fixed, revising our conception of what has transpired. (So, at &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/books/swann-s-way-9780142437964/9780375751547"&gt;the start of Proust’s &lt;i&gt;Remembrance of Things Past&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a young Marcel interprets
      Gilberte’s indecent gesture in the garden at Tansonville as a rejection; five volumes later, she corrects him, letting him know that her hand signal meant he should join her in sexual games with the other children of the neighborhood.) Still another
      pleasure is discovering a character’s ironic fate years after a pivotal drama. (Hence, in Tolstoy’s &lt;a href="https://bookshop.org/books/war-and-peace-vintage-classics-9781400079988/9781400079988"&gt;&lt;i&gt;War and Peace&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the
      thrill when Prince Andrei, mortally wounded after the Battle of Borodino, is unwittingly lifted onto Natasha’s caravan, hundreds of pages after these characters’ engagement to be married was broken.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duration, the sense of having
      shared in so much eventfulness, seems essential to these transporting experiences of uncanny knowledge. It stands in stark contrast to the most basic effect the novel counts upon: a reader’s fastening onto a narrator, any “I” or restricted point of
      view, immediately and habitually. Make a character’s perspective ours, and our emotional allegiance is astonishing. Her belief is ours, her shame is ours, her fear, her will. Identification kicks in with even the thinnest
      characterization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using her chronology-scrambling technique in &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;, Egan demonstrated a shortcut to delivering long-range pleasures, those intense, rare pangs of retrospect and return. She bypassed the
      kind of unbroken biography of heroes that ordinarily requires many more pages, and instead offered porthole glimpses of her protagonists as seen by peripheral characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these observers was given a tic, motif, or symbolic
      compulsion to distinguish and vivify his or her narration. Those signatures included kleptomania and mild paranoia, a penchant for summarizing the action in anthropological lingo, and family conflict as seen through a child’s PowerPoint presentation.
      Egan drew on our bottomless reservoir of sympathy for anyone whose perspective we temporarily inhabit, stimulating the same melancholy response, over and over, as she dramatized each minor character’s sorrow at his or her failed understanding,
      miscommunication, incomplete knowledge of the bigger drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad &lt;/i&gt;brilliantly hewed to a narrow band of emotions, principally disappointment, regret, shame, and unrequited longing, which were well served
      by the crosscutting and temporal discontinuity. Nonreciprocal crushes structured the foreground. Rhea wants Bennie, but “Bennie is waiting for Alice, who’s waiting for Scotty, who’s waiting for Jocelyn.” The dynamic recurs a generation later: Sasha
      trusts Rob, who pines for Drew, who loves Sasha. Behind this, Egan replayed the same primal, sentimental scene of a son or daughter, a wife or lover, unable to gain true or exclusive attention from a “selfish, devouring man,” the father—whether he’s
      a record-company executive or, in a strange interlude, a genocidal dictator in an unnamed foreign country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The repetitive formula of brief characterization made all tenses and persons and modes of writing essentially equivalent,
      producing enjoyable shivers of regret. The chapter rendered as a child’s PowerPoint slides was the celebrated example. Readers marveled that such a skeletal form could still bring them to tears. This seemed a kind of magic—which it was, but less
      through sorcery than mechanical sleight of hand. The lesson seemed to be that, once the emotional elements were set in place, it really made no difference to us whether the result was written-through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upshot was a satisfying
      dose of sentimentality, in the form of a particular fantasy quest: After all the pain and loss, could modern fathers become faithful and child-centered? &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt; ended in an otherwise mystifying sci-fi vision of apocalyptic
      reconciliation. In a climate-change-spooked New York City, all music became music for children, who made their desires known through smartphone-like “handsets.” Scotty, the failed rocker of Bennie’s generation, triumphed at last with a children’s
      concert, and the alpha males of the book made peace with being middle-aged (“You grew up … just like the rest of us”), and were ready to go looking for the women they’d never appreciated, who were not to be found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
      class="dropcap"&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;&lt;span class="italic caps smallcaps smallcaps-italic"&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;&lt;span class="italic caps smallcaps smallcaps-italic"&gt;he Candy
      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="italic caps smallcaps smallcaps-italic"&gt;House&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; knows the techniques of &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;, but doesn’t recognize the limits of their strengths. It is like Samson after
      a haircut. To make her mode work previously, Egan had to address regret, failure, decline. She needed to feature the piquant memories of losers who, like all of us mortals, grow up to be something less than the heroes our youthful selves imagined
      we’d be. This time around, her major characters win and win and win. If inspiration or direction eludes them for a bit, most still win again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new novel opens with Bix Bouton taking a lonesome walk. When last we saw him in
      &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;, he was a graduate student in computer science. He is now in effect a fictional Mark Zuckerberg. His company is called Mandala, not Facebook; he has colonized Manhattan, not Menlo Park; he is loved, not hated. At
      least the book doesn’t hate him. It apologizes for his creation of an encompassing capitalist social network by making him Black. Online, he was certain, racism would be overcome. (The novel does not revisit this point.) His big achievement behind
      him, Bix feels lost, wondering whether he can revolutionize the world again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He puts on a disguise and wanders into an interdisciplinary gathering of academics, including Ted Hollander, last seen in &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;
      as a dispirited art-history professor and Sasha’s benevolent uncle. Luckily, academics are full of good ideas, and a “Brazilian animal studies professor” informs Bix that she and her lab colleagues have begun uploading animal consciousnesses to
      computers. &lt;i&gt;Eureka!&lt;/i&gt; The seeds of Own Your Unconscious are planted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next chapter focuses on one of Ted’s sons, Alfred. He has a &lt;i&gt;Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;–style obsession (authenticity) and a tic (screaming
      bloody murder in public, to jolt bystanders out of their phony social roles). Seeking a recovery of the past that will somehow restore him to wholeness, he travels with his girlfriend to visit Jack Stevens, the only authentic, free,
      what-you-see-is-what-you-get kid he knew in high school. Jack—older, paunchy, divorced—lives in a crappy suburb, drinks beer, looks at the beauty of the sunset, and desperately loves his kids; his true worry is losing custody. Sunsets, children:
      “Alfred wanted to sit there forever.” The screamer is released from his obsession, finally at home in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These chapters signal the old dynamic. The powerful producer reaches middle age—will he realize that his achievements
      are hollow? Will the middle generation be freed from its compulsions and resentments, bringing the elders the truth that family, children, and suburban evenings are what matter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet unlike &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;,
      &lt;i&gt;The Candy House&lt;/i&gt; goes all in on the celebrity fantasia and undermines the ordinariness. Bix isn’t the only old friend who is doing rather well. Sasha, who fled the music industry to become a craft-focused homemaker in the California
      desert, is now a world-famous land artist. Global collectors beat a path to her door. Mindy, who was getting her Ph.D. in &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;, discovered the fundamental algorithms that power all social media. Her daughters patented and
      sold the algorithms to finance their takeover of the music industry as it moved to online streaming. “Most of the music you hear passes through my hands,” one of them tells us, “and I’ve absorbed innumerable companies along the
      way.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even newly met characters in this book soar, becoming rich and famous. We finally encounter Bennie’s mother, whom we had known only as an impoverished single mom of five and an immigrant from Honduras. Now she is a bitcoin
      success story who “cashed out at the top of the market, netting untold millions.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sad sacks of this installment are Ted’s various children, but none is sad for very long. Miles, the eldest, is a top lawyer and yuppie who becomes
      a drug addict and pauper, then turns his life around and becomes a state senator. Ames, the ignored middle child, takes off for a career as a Special Ops sharpshooter and assassin, then gets to retire to his childhood home and reminisce. What really
      matters is the walk-off grand slam he hit in a Little League game in the suburbs as a child, and the love of his dad, who kisses his sweaty head. “ ‘What now, slugger?’ he asks. ‘Anything you want.’ ” These are the book’s last lines—touching, I
      suppose, though a Little League miracle hardly registers as such when &lt;i&gt;The Candy House&lt;/i&gt;’s characters bestride the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;In a novel&lt;/span&gt; where almost everyone’s
      luck has turned good, Egan’s reach for the heartstrings loses its plucking power. To compensate, she introduces satirical diversions that explore technology’s challenge to fiction. First she conscripts Chris Salazar, Bennie’s son and a freshly minted
      Stanford English grad. The CEO of an “entertainment start-up” has hired him to turn stock elements of movies and TV into algebra. The company’s computers will optimize, rationalize, and monetize the world’s narratives, as Mandala has done for
      consciousness. Chris’s savior is a “raffish outsider” on a Harley-Davidson, who awakens him to the weirdos, misfits, and junkies outside tech’s “cushy citadel.” Cue Mondrian, Chris’s counter-start-up for freedom, an “invisible army of data
      defiers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next satire might as well be a product of the entertainment start-up’s narrative-generating software. Lulu, the adorable self-possessed child from &lt;i&gt;The Goon Squad&lt;/i&gt;, has grown up to be a Bionic
      Woman–like “citizen agent.” Her chapter, “Lulu the Spy, 2035,” outdoes Egan’s earlier PowerPoint presentation. It’s composed in epigrams (the book’s promotional copy calls them “tweets”), dictated by our heroine to her mind-reading military brain
      implant. The mission is straight from &lt;i&gt;Bond &lt;/i&gt;films (or &lt;i&gt;Get Smart&lt;/i&gt;), as Lulu cozies up to international criminals in their luxurious Mediterranean villas. It’s pulp techno-kitsch of a singularly giddy kind, because
      her handlers have equipped her with awkward transmitters implanted in every part of her body. (“A button is embedded behind the inside ligament of your right knee … Depress twice to indicate to loved ones that you are well and thinking of
      them.”)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this campy futurology takes over, the novel culminates in a fantasy of reconciliation between “stories” and “tech,” played out, naturally, as a father-child drama. As Bix, the tech daddy, lies dying, he makes a secret
      alliance with Chris, the metaphorical rebel son, and leaves a huge bequest of Mandala wealth to Mondrian. Bix’s real son, Gregory, a stymied novelist, had left the family: “Nothing could change Gregory’s belief that Own Your Unconscious posed an
      existential threat to fiction.” Now he realizes that, viewed the right way—from a free storytelling mind—online archiving of memory gives a writer more material. Social media and cloud consciousness were really “his father’s parting gift: a galaxy of
      human lives hurtling toward his curiosity … He was feeling the collective without any machinery at all. And its stories, infinite and particular, would be his to tell.” He’ll finish his novel after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like a new-age George Eliot,
      Egan steps in to anoint this revelation with an authorial apothegm: “Only Gregory Bouton’s machine—this one, fiction—lets us roam with absolute freedom through the human collective.” I confess this ending stirred the old melancholy in me. You cannot
      proclaim the novel a winner, in a cardboard contest between tech and tales, while whirring along yourself on stock elements and toothless satires of bad movies. At her best, Egan has been the inventor of algorithms of rich complexity, stimulating
      core human yearnings through technical devices. Trying them again, but this time to evoke a triumphal register of emotions, she has proved the pertinence of Silicon Valley gospel to her fiction: To keep her audience spellbound, sitting still won’t
      work. She’ll have to innovate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;This article appears in the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2022/04/?utm_source=feed"&gt;&lt;i&gt;April 2022&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;h3&gt;I Remember Conservatism&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p class="letter-intro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the January/February issue, &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/brooks-true-conservatism-dead-fox-news-voter-suppression/620853/?utm_source=feed"&gt;David Brooks wrote about&lt;/a&gt; how the rich philosophical tradition he fell in love with has been
      reduced to Fox News and voter suppression.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Brooks’s poignant essay reads like a breakup letter from a disappointed lover. But his disappointment may result from his having held unrealistic expectations of
      his paramour. Burkean conservatism has always looked better in the wood-paneled offices of elite periodicals and think tanks than on the gritty streets of the real world. The moral sentiments and manners extolled by Burke and Brooks were always
      relative, obligatory for dealings with other members of the club but not for dealings with the staff. American conservatives have long had a narrow view of which groups qualify for membership, and found utility in rallying support against the
      “other”: Barry Goldwater and communism, George W. Bush and terrorism, Donald Trump and immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;aside class="callout-placeholder" data-source="magazine-issue"&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks talks as though the conservative embrace
      of racism and wealth inequality emerged from the shadows only upon Trump’s election, but it was Ronald Reagan who demonized so-called welfare queens and told us that the government he ran was the problem, not the solution. Reagan’s conservative heirs
      have continued to preach his gospel while gutting public institutions. Rather than representing an aberrant and temporary detour for mainstream Republicans, as Brooks suggests, Trump was the logical culmination of their evolution since
      Reagan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope that Brooks will find a new and more fulfilling love among moderate Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliot Brenowitz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Seattle,
      Wash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Brooks is right to criticize the departure of the Republican Party from traditional conservative ideology in favor of fascism. But his reasoning carefully avoids the uncomfortable reality that
      fearmongering, ethnocentrism, and the particular populism that is unique to the far right are deeply rooted in conservative liberalism. His failure to acknowledge the not-so-rosy past of conservatism undermines his argument that traditional
      conservatism remains valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world Brooks describes as “true conservatism” is a world of fiction, one that has failed to genuinely handle the wonderful heterogeneity of the real world and has paid for it
      dearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jessie Gorovitz&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;London, U.K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s very clear from his essay that David Brooks’s fondest wish would be for Burkean conservatism to take
      hold in our society, strongly influencing our legal and moral decisions. Unfortunately, that won’t happen. That brand of conservatism thrives best—perhaps thrives only—in relatively small, homogeneous, static groups, where day-to-day behavioral
      expectations do not require us to confront a quickly evolving, complex society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks calls upon the vague 18th-century concept of “sentiments” to “tell you what is beautiful and what is ugly, what to want and what is worth
      wanting, where to go and what to aim for.” But living in a multicultural community such as ours, whose sentiments are we required to follow? Who decides for us all? A priest, a rabbi, a minister, an imam? An admired academic? A newspaper publisher?
      We can’t accept “the latent wisdom that is passed down by generations.” To do so would be to accept slavery and acknowledge the divine right of a king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt that this country and the larger world are under terrific
      existential pressures. But David Brooks’s idealized conservatism is not our route to salvation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Werdegar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Naperville, Ill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;I appreciated
      David Brooks’s essay, and wholeheartedly agree that the U.S. requires a responsible center-right party to counter the excesses of the left. I wonder, however, where Brooks sees a durable “rightward edge of the leftward tendency” in the modern
      Democratic Party. Perhaps with Joe Manchin, currently the most hated man in Washington and the only Democrat who could be elected in West Virginia? To my eyes, President Biden has done nothing but capitulate to the left flank of the party (to no
      benefit), and moderate seats are vulnerable in the midterms. Does Brooks see a party ready to even consider that it’s veered too far to the left? Brooks should devote his energy to excising Trumpism from the Republican Party; there’s no Burkean
      conservatism to be found among the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin Reed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Gaithersburg, Md.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooks argues that intellectually defensible conservatism died with
      Mitt Romney’s presidential bid. That is just nonsense. As long as people like Susan Collins, Ben Sasse, Pat Toomey, and Romney himself are still in the U.S. Senate, responsible conservatism has a voice and a future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking as an
      ever-loyal Republican, but one who is well aware that the party currently suffers from demagogic temptation, ideological rigidity, and lack of leadership, I wish Brooks would contribute his considerable talent to helping to preserve its

      issue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fact-checkers frequently rely on photographs to verify details in an article—that a source was present at the rally, that the blood spatter formed a certain pattern, that the man’s eyes were really blue. Even when
      facts are well documented in other media, pictures can enrich our understanding of events. That was the case this month, as &lt;i&gt;Atlantic&lt;/i&gt; editor at large Cullen Murphy reviewed Fintan O’Toole’s sweeping “personal history” of Ireland,
      which intersects with Murphy’s own personal history. As a child, Murphy moved with his family from Connecticut to Dublin, where, though he didn’t know it at the time, they lived near the young O’Toole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt="black and
      white photo of crowd of people with destroyed pillar and buildings behind them" height="689" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/img/posts/2022/03/20220203065418_00001/8f7841163.jpg" width="665"&gt; &lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;Cullen
      Murphy&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the morning of March 8, 1966, when the top of Nelson’s Pillar was blown off by an IRA splinter group, both boys’ fathers took them to see the damage. O’Toole writes that “huge lumps of stone were
      scattered randomly like pebbles,” and his father took a small chunk home as a souvenir. Murphy had the same impulse, and pocketed some pieces (one sits on his desk to this day). Murphy also snapped this photograph, with a Kodak Brownie, capturing
      what he describes as the “ragged stump” of the monument and a swarm of curious, frightened Dubliners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie Hayes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Deputy Research Chief&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Behind the

    <content type="html">&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;H&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;e &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60551140"&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; any country&lt;/span&gt; that interfered in his &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/?utm_source=feed"&gt;invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; with “consequences greater than any you have faced in history.” He &lt;a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-kyiv-business-europe-moscow-2e4e1cf784f22b6afbe5a2f936725550"&gt;placed&lt;/a&gt; his nuclear forces on high alert and &lt;a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-vladimir-putin-business-europe-moscow-563573526a93ea73a95698d8ddb61b9c"&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; exercises with them. And then he &lt;a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/05/world/europe/ukraine-russia-putin.html"&gt;proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; that Western sanctions amounted to a “declaration of war” against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of humanity suddenly seems to be in the
      unsteady hands of an isolated, frustrated, and potentially unhinged Vladimir Putin. And people are understandably &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BeijingPalmer/status/1499252374300504065?s=20&amp;amp;t=bCbOzmppzKzaN0OfbcDHPw"&gt;panicked&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2022/03/03/vladimir-putin-nuclear-ukraine-lose-war/"&gt;about&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/25/opinion/putin-russia-ukraine.html"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; prospect. “The fact that
      there’s a very short path from, say, Putin feeling humiliated to the end of life as we know it,” the sociologist Kieran Healy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kjhealy/status/1498052193190043661"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “is literally
      insane.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point of the conflict over Ukraine, &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/to-decipher-putins-nuclear-threats-watch-what-he-does-not-what-he-says/"&gt;the odds are&lt;/a&gt; that the
      Russian president’s threats amount to a bluff intended to intimidate and coerce his opponents in the West. But regardless of whether the risk of nuclear war has actually increased, Putin’s actions have opened our eyes to how dependent we all are on
      the whims—or even the missteps or miscalculations that fallible, emotional, semi-rational human beings make when moving quickly in crisis—of one man and his nuclear arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our current predicament should, in fact, open our eyes
      wider still to the more profound problem of a similar susceptibility in the United States and other nuclear-armed countries—and to how few checks there truly are on leaders who decide to use the world’s most destructive weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The
      reactions to Putin’s threats remind me of 2017, when Donald Trump started unleashing &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/01/trump-nuclear-button-tweet/549551/?utm_source=feed"&gt;nuclear threats&lt;/a&gt; against North
      Korea, and many Americans began to understand the U.S. president’s expansive power to use nuclear weapons. Be it with Putin now, Trump then, or a &lt;a
      href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/08/11/donald-trump-nuclear-weapons-richard-nixon-215478/"&gt;Watergate-addled Richard Nixon in the 1970s&lt;/a&gt;, the delicate nature of the world’s framework for deterring nuclear war typically
      dawns on people only when leaders of nuclear states start acting in extraordinary and seemingly reckless ways, even though the underlying condition of vulnerability is always present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The entire system of nuclear deterrence is and
      always has been incredibly dangerous and fragile,” Eryn MacDonald, a global-security analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told me. “We tend not to notice this—or, perhaps, are more able to push this knowledge far enough into the background
      to ignore how disturbing it is—until there is a crisis that brings the absurdity of the whole system into focus.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;W&lt;span class="smallcaps"&gt;e don’t know a lot&lt;/span&gt; about how exactly the authority to
      launch nuclear weapons works in Russia. This opacity is deliberate. All nuclear command-and-control systems, including America’s, have a “first rule of Fight Club”-like aspect to them: You don’t talk much about them, to keep your enemies guessing.
      But Pavel Podvig, an expert on Russian nuclear forces (who, even armed with all his knowledge, speaks about some of his assessments in terms of guesswork), &lt;a
      href="https://twitter.com/russianforces/status/1500252764810719235?s=20&amp;amp;t=4Gs9dhUWhk3VS4YcwBTgew"&gt;has concluded&lt;/a&gt; that the Russian president can probably order the use of nuclear weapons on his own, even if the country’s policies
      aren’t necessarily designed that way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian system, which dates back to the 1970s and &lt;a href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/whose-finger-button"&gt;was &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a
      href="https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/whose-finger-button"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt; with Soviet-era collective, centralized decision making in mind, calls for the defense minister and the chief of the military’s general staff to be looped in on any
      orders by the country’s leader to use nuclear weapons, giving them an opportunity to influence the decision. (Experts think each of these figures possesses a &lt;a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-is-chain-command-potential-russian-nuclear-strikes-2022-03-02/"&gt;Cheget&lt;/a&gt;, Russia’s rough equivalent of the American “nuclear football,” though whether all three briefcases are needed to
      transmit a nuclear-launch order is unclear.) If, as &lt;a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/03/putin-has-tactical-nuclear-advantage/%20https:/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/03/03/putin-has-tactical-nuclear-advantage/"&gt;some speculate&lt;/a&gt; he might in the course of the
      conflict in Ukraine, Putin were to reach for his tactical nuclear weapons—a lower-yield, shorter-range variety that can be deployed on the battlefield—he would need to remove them from storage and prepare them for use in a relatively protracted
      process that would ostensibly involve more consultations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But given the degree to which Putin has recently concentrated power, it appears that no actor in the Russian system would actually be able to veto a presidential decision to
      use nuclear weapons. Podvig told me that any Russian plan to employ nuclear weapons would likely have to first be developed by military officials, who would thus “have a chance to offer their opinion [and] raise objections.” Nevertheless, he added,
      “ultimately they are there to carry out orders, not to dispute them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Were Russia to come under attack, its system calls for solid confirmation of such an offensive to initiate retaliatory nuclear strikes, he explained, “but when it
      comes to a deliberate [Russian] first strike [with nuclear weapons], most safeguards could be circumvented.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. nuclear-launch system has its own ambiguities, but one element is clearer than in Russia’s system: The American
      president has &lt;a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/natsec/IF10521.pdf"&gt;sole authority&lt;/a&gt; to order the use of nuclear weapons, without any need to consult with or obtain the assent of top military or civilian advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s
      a reality rarely dwelled upon, even by those whose job is to dwell on it. In 2017, in the throes of Trump’s vows to rain down “fire and fury” on Kim Jong Un, I &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/11/trump-nuclear-weapons-senate/545846/?utm_source=feed"&gt;tuned in&lt;/a&gt; as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held the first congressional hearing on the subject in 41 years. I
      was shocked by how many members of Congress’s premier foreign-affairs committee seemed to be just getting up to speed on the commander in chief’s exclusive power in matters of nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This concentrated executive authority—which
      &lt;a href="https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Finger-on-the-Nuclear-Button.pdf"&gt;contrasts&lt;/a&gt; with more collective decision making in nuclear states such as India and Pakistan, where nuclear-use powers &lt;a
      href="https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2017/11/Launch-Authority.pdf"&gt;are vested&lt;/a&gt; in councils—is in large part a &lt;a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/01/no-one-can-stop-president-trump-from-using-nuclear-weapons-thats-by-design/"&gt;legacy of the Cold War&lt;/a&gt;. During that period, the U.S. government chose to categorize nuclear
      weapons differently than other weapons and put them under the &lt;a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2009_5/Lanouette"&gt;circumscribed civilian control&lt;/a&gt; of the country’s democratically elected political leader. The approach was
      informed by a prolonged nuclear standoff with the Soviet Union that placed a premium on enabling quick decisions, because an American leader might have only minutes to retaliate against a surprise nuclear assault.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, in both
      Russia and the United States, despite what Trump might have &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/01/trump-nuclear-button-tweet/549551/?utm_source=feed"&gt;led us to believe&lt;/a&gt;, the proverbial “nuclear button” is a
      myth; even with the immense executive authority to launch nuclear weapons in each country, any such presidential order would &lt;a href="https://www.nonproliferation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Finger-on-the-Nuclear-Button.pdf"&gt;necessarily need
      to pass&lt;/a&gt; through other individuals with varying degrees of agency. But based on what we know of the Russian and American systems, does Joe Biden actually have fewer checks on his power to wage nuclear war than Putin
      does?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The response when I posed that question to MacDonald and Podvig: It’s complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In theory, they explained, the Russian system for launching nuclear weapons has more checks, because it seems to technically
      require the consent of others beyond just the president. But in practice, given Putin’s firm grip on power, the president’s underlings are unlikely to object to his order and liable to be easily replaced if they have the audacity to do
      so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, by contrast, the obstacles to a president firing these weapons are theoretically fewer but practically perhaps greater than in Russia. Nuclear-strike options &lt;a
      href="https://media.nti.org/documents/The_President_and_Nuclear_Weapons_Authorities_Limits_and_Process.pdf"&gt;require&lt;/a&gt; legal review before they're presented to the U.S. president, for example, and those executing an order at least have the
      option of resisting a command they deem unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever “the actual arrangements and safeguards” in both countries, Podvig noted, “ultimately, a determined commander in chief would be able to execute a first [nuclear]
      strike.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MacDonald argued that certain policy reforms could reduce the risks associated with the world’s system of nuclear deterrence. She pointed to two proposals among the &lt;a
      href="https://securityandtechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wellerstein_commander_nc3_IST_report.pdf"&gt;many that have been floated&lt;/a&gt;. One option would be to mandate that &lt;a
      href="https://ucsusa.org/resources/three-heads-are-better-one"&gt;more people&lt;/a&gt; be involved in decisions to use nuclear weapons. (In recent years, the trend in nuclear states appears to be going in &lt;a
      href="https://securityandtechnology.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/wellerstein_commander_nc3_IST_report.pdf"&gt;the opposite direction&lt;/a&gt;—toward greater centralization of launch authority in the chief executive.) Another would be to take the
      hotly debated step of declaring that the United States will never be the first actor to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. (Other nuclear experts such as my Atlantic Council colleague Matthew Kroenig &lt;a
      href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/the-special-role-of-us-nuclear-weapons/"&gt;have argued&lt;/a&gt; that adopting this policy would undermine deterrence and introduce different dangers, such as emboldening
      U.S. adversaries to use conventional force against the United States and its allies without concern about nuclear retaliation from Washington.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Russia is highly unlikely to adopt a “no first use” policy at the moment,
      MacDonald acknowledged that “even a unilateral U.S. declaration would still reduce the risk of a misunderstanding or miscommunication causing a conventional conflict to escalate to a nuclear exchange.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="dropcap"&gt;I&lt;span
      class="smallcaps"&gt;n my reporting&lt;/span&gt; on nuclear-weapons issues over the years, I have often found myself racing down rabbit holes of research and reckoning with the immense spectrum of possibilities only to emerge stupefied, wondering how
      anyone can be talking or writing about anything else. This might be why most people don’t talk about it much. And then, every so often, dramatic developments in the world have a way of awakening us from our collective slumber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As
      Beatrice Fihn, the executive director of the Nobel Peace Prize–winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, &lt;a
      href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/11/beatrice-fihn-nuclear-weapons/545096/?utm_source=feed"&gt;told me&lt;/a&gt; during the “fire and fury” era, “If you’re uncomfortable with nuclear weapons under Donald Trump, you’re
      probably uncomfortable with nuclear weapons, because it means you recognize that [deterrence] won’t always hold up and things can go wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Once you start thinking ‘this person is appropriate for this weapon but not that person,’”
      she said, “then maybe it’s the weapon that’s the problem.”&lt;/p&gt;</content>
