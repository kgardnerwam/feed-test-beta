														<p>Astralwerks and Blue Note Records have partnered with Spotify to release <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/bluewerks-vol-6-open-the-window/"><em>Bluewerks: Spotify Singles</em></a>, the seventh installment of the iconic labels&#x2019; collaborative Lo-Fi series where downtempo electronica meets jazz-infused sounds.
</p><p>Bluewerks has amassed more than 25 million streams on Spotify since its launch last year, and this new EP finds four different artists&#x2014;Arbour, Oatmello, Shrimpnose, and Somni&#x2014;step into Spotify Studios in Los Angeles to create a brand new original as well as a Lo-Fi cover of songs from the Astralwerks and Blue Note catalogs.</p>
<p>The calming collection is released in connection with Spotify&#x2019;s Mental Health Awareness initiative and the tracks are currently featured on their LoFi Beats playlist. Driving more than five billion streams since the program began in 2017, Spotify Singles was created to give artists an opportunity to record new versions of their own songs, the songs of the artists they love, or an original song. To date, there have been over 600 recordings from more than 300 artists across all genres.
</p><p>Says Somni regarding the release, &#x201C;I think for me, making music can be really therapeutic and cathartic, and when I put my emotions into my music it helps me let go of them a little bit in my mind, it&#x2019;s a release. Almost like you&#x2019;re dealing with them in some tangible way, putting them out on the table, and as a result you&#x2019;re able to let go of some of that energy that you had inside you.
</p><p>&#x201C;The process can also be super meditative, and some of the only times I&#x2019;ve forgotten about my anxieties and the pressures of life are when I&#x2019;m in that tunnelvision state. I think a lot of musicians and artists feel the same way about the process, that&#x2019;s why art and creativity in any form is such an important thing.&#x201D;

														<p>Dermot Kennedy has shared his new single &#x201C;Something To Someone.&#x201D; The song marks his first release since his Top 20 UK hit, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/dermot-kennedy-better-days-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;Better Days,&#x201D;</a></strong> which came out last July.
</p><p>In a statement about the song, Kennedy elaborated on the song&#x2019;s meaning, saying it&#x2019;s &#x201C;To be something to someone. To love and be loved in return. What a comforting thought it is to know that no matter what you endure, no matter how lonely the world may seem, you&#x2019;re still on somebody&#x2019;s mind. It is the only thing. I want this song to be a reminder to whoever hears it that they are loved.&#x201D;</p>

														<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/jamie-t-announces-15th-anniversary-reissue-panic-prevention/">Jamie T</a></strong> has announced details of his forthcoming new album, <em>The Theory of Whatever</em>. To celebrate the news, Jamie released &#x201C;The Old Style Raiders,&#x201D; which premiered  as Hottest Record In The World on Radio 1, alongside a video directed by Niall Trask.
</p><p>The singer songwriter&#x2019;s fifth studio album will be released on July 29 on Polydor Records. It follows the 15-year Anniversary celebrations of <em>Panic Prevention</em>, Jamie T&#x2019;s seminal debut album which went platinum this year.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6kZ2xUaqxQ?rel=0" name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="uD-YT-video"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O6kZ2xUaqxQ?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>The announcement includes details of Jamie T&#x2019;s first live show in five years. South Londoner Jamie T&#x2014;born Jamie Treays&#x2014;had some 180 songs written in the five-and-half-years since the release of 2016&#x2019;s <em>Trick</em>. &#x201C;I was struggling to find my direction with the record for a few years, really,&#x201D; he admits. Bunkered in his East London home studio, he wrote and rewrote, playing all the guitar and keyboard parts himself.
</p><p>&#x201C;I went home one day, and I found this track that I had recorded, pretty much fully finished. And I was really upset, because I realized that I&#x2019;d spent the last six months asking other people to tell me if something was good. Then I heard this track and I just immediately knew I&#x2019;d kind of found my path.&#x201D;
</p><p>That song is &#x201C;The Old Style Raiders,&#x201D; a lean, taut indie-rock anthem with a heads-thrown-back chorus you can hang your hat on (&#x201C;Toe the line! / Hard to find! / Told to fight for something you love in life&#x2026;&#x201D;). &#x201C;It&#x2019;s got hope in it,&#x201D; answers Treays when asked what makes &#x201C;The Old Style Raiders&#x201D; his album&#x2019;s opening statement.
</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s fighting to find something that means enough to you that you love. The fight to find that, and to carry on striving, to find something you love enough to hold on to.
</p><p>&#x201C;Rather than kid love or movie love or, gushy love or lust love, whatever you have when you&#x2019;re younger&#x2014;it&#x2019;s actually trying to fight for something that means more than that. It&#x2019;s the struggle to find that.&#x201D;
</p><p>Produced by Hugo White, the song was a pathfinder, a direction forward for a boundlessly productive artist who will freely admit that, for a minute there, he lost his way creatively. From there, he drilled down and focused on 13 vital, pin-sharp, melody-rich, spikily provocative, visually vivid, and narratively expansive tunes that make up <em>The Theory of Whatever</em>.

														<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/yo-gotti-birthday-bash/">Lehla Samia</a></strong>, the latest signing to Yo Gotti&#x2019;s ever-dominant CMG Records, has released her debut single, &#x201C;Call on Me.&#x201D; As part of the announcement, Samia also dropped the visuals for the intimate, catchy new song.
</p><p>&#x201C;Call on Me&#x201D; finds the singer crafting a hypnotizing blend of hip-hop vibes and soulful hooks, making it abundantly clear why she&#x2019;s both the first R&amp;B artist and the first woman Gotti signed to his label. The romantic track showcases Samia&#x2019;s jaw-dropping vocals and knack for melodies that will stick in your head all night long. </p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGCFEaW91SM?rel=0" name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class="uD-YT-video"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGCFEaW91SM?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>The track expertly builds off of SWV&#x2019;s 1996 hit, &#x201C;You&#x2019;re the One,&#x201D; bouncy synths and club-ready snaps providing a perfect backdrop for Samia to beckon a crush. &#x201C;Boy don&#x2019;t you know that you really turn me on/I think I might be goin&#x2019; crazy, baby, but I know what I&#x2019;m feeling,&#x201D; she sings as her layered harmonies raise up the message.
</p><p>Samia originally built a robust online following after recording covers and remixes of popular R&amp;B songs &#x2014; affectionately known as &#x201C;LehMixes&#x201D; &#x2014; and uploading them to social media. As she juggled nursing school with her passion, Samia inevitably established growing buzz as her flips of Queen Naija&#x2019;s &#x201C;Butterflies&#x201D; and Coi Leray&#x2019;s &#x201C;No More Parties&#x201D; exploded on TikTok.
</p><p>That virality helped the Delaware native secure over 1.2 million followers and 14 million likes on TikTok to date. Most notably, Samia&#x2019;s dynamic vocals captured Gotti&#x2019;s attention and prompted the CMG CEO to fly the rising star to Miami for a studio session that would change her life and career trajectory. Earlier this week, Gotti formally announced that he signed Samia to CMG by gifting the 22-year-old songstress a new, pink, Lamborghini Urus.
</p><p>Now, with &#x201C;Call on Me,&#x201D; fans will get to see what Gotti saw in Samia &#x2014; mesmerizing vocals and a unique ability to deliver a dynamic hook.

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
														<p>Acclaimed saxophonist, philosopher, bandleader, and musician Shabaka Hutchings, now professionally known as Shabaka across all solo musical efforts, announces his first major label solo body of work, <em>Afrikan Culture</em>, through Impulse!, out on May 20.
</p><p>Entirely written by Shabaka, the eight-track digital only EP showcases him on various wind instruments and focuses on the aural meditative space. The first track off the introspective set is &#x201C;Black Meditation&#x201D; and you can watch the song&#x2019;s accompanying visualizer below.</p>
<p>&#x201C;<em>Afrikan Culture</em> was made around the idea of meditation and what it means for me to still my own mind and accept the music which comes to the surface,&#x201D; says Shabaka. &#x201C;It features various types of Shakuhachi flutes and a new technique of creating that I&#x2019;ve been experimenting with in layering many flutes together to create a forest of sound where melodies and rhythms float in space and emerge in glimpses.&#x201D;
</p><p>Produced by Shabaka and frequent collaborator Dilip Harris, Afrikan Culture takes you on a sonically healing journey. Immersed in a sea of sound, diverse instruments that include the Shakuhachi (a Japanese end-blown flute), a Kora (a stringed instrument used extensively in West Africa), a Mbira (a &#x201C;thumb piano&#x201D; from Africa), and a music box envelopes the listener in a soothing sound that lingers on well past the last played note.

<p>The British-born Barbados-raised saxophonist and clarinetist is the centrifugal force in three critically acclaimed bands: Sons of Kemet, The Comet Is Coming, and the South African-centered Shabaka and the Ancestors.
</p><p>He signed to <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/story-of-impulse-records/"><strong>Impulse!</strong></a> in 2018 after a six-year stretch rising to prominence with international sold-out shows that dissolved old genre boundaries and attracted eminent attention. Along the way he picked up accolades including two Mercury Prize nominations, a MOBO and a 2020 inclusion as one of Downbeat&#x2019;s &#x201C;Musicians Shaping The Future Of Jazz.&#x201D;
</p><p>His band The Comet Is Coming created a memorable NPR Tiny Desk show. There has been endless coverage from <em>The New Yorker</em> to Afropunk. <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sons-kemet-nubya-garcia-love-supreme-2022/"><strong>Sons of Kemet</strong></a> appeared in <em>The New York Time&#x2019;s</em> Magazines &#x201C;Songs That Matter Right Now&#x201D; and <em>Pitchfork&#x2019;s</em> &#x201C;Best Songs of the 2010s&#x201D; and were included in the soundtrack to ground-breaking visual media including Beyonc&#xE9;&#x2019;s Homecoming on Netflix and Michaela Coel&#x2019;s award-winning BBC/HBO show <em>I May Destroy You</em>. In 2021 Sons of Kemet released <em>Black To The Future</em> to much critical acclaim and landed on several year-end &#x201C;best of&#x201D; lists including <em>Stereogum, NPR</em>, and <em>Paste</em>.

														<p>Sea Girls have shared the official video for their new single &#x201C;DNA&#x201D; and you can watch it below.
</p><p>The London band originally released the track as a limited edition blue 7&#x2033; vinyl for <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/record-store-day-2022-contest-vinyl-prizes/"><strong>Record Store Day 2022</strong></a>, which took place on April 23.<br>
Following demand from fans, &#x201C;DNA&#x201D; has now arrived on major streaming platforms and comes with a scenic, sun-soaked official video that was shot against a stunning backdrop of the Swiss mountains.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We read your tweets, replied to DMs and loved all your comments about &#x2018;DNA&#x2019; and released it for you!&#x201D; Sea Girls wrote in the clip&#x2019;s description. &#x201C;We made this video on a day off from tour in Zurich.&#x201D;
</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gU0ry0Rr6wU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gU0ry0Rr6wU?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>Frontman Henry Camamile said: &#x201C;We felt that there was another story to tell from the <em>Homesick</em> era, an itch that &#x2018;DNA&#x2019; scratches.
</p><p>&#x201C;This track is a monumental celebration of being strange. It ponders belonging and identity. &#x201C;DNA&#x201D; celebrates people who don&#x2019;t fit in. You are who you are and that&#x2019;s why people love you.&#x201D;
</p><p>As for the single&#x2019;s Becky Garner-directed visuals, Camamile explained: &#x201C;We shot it in just one take whilst travelling between shows on our latest European tour. Our tour bus was heading over the mountains between Germany and Switzerland, and it just all made sense &#x2013; we had to film there. I think we managed to stumble upon one of the most beautiful locations on earth!&#x201D;
</p><p>Sea Girls&#x2019; second studio record, <em>Homesick</em>, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sea-girls-brixton-lyric-video-hometown/"><strong>came out back in March and landed at Number Three in the UK albums chart</strong></a>. It followed on from the band&#x2019;s 2020 debut, <em>Open Up Your Head</em>.
</p><p>The band are set to appear at various UK festivals this summer, including Live At Leeds: In The Park, Isle Of Wight Festival, Y Not and Kendal Calling.
</p><p>In November, the group will also embark on a UK headline tour which includes a huge show at London&#x2019;s Alexandra Palace.

														<p>Yungblud has shared an emotive new video with Willow for their new collaboration &#x201C;Memories&#x201D;, which you can watch below.
</p><p>Towards the end of last year, Yungblud was pictured in the studio with Willow, as the pair initially hinted at a forthcoming collaboration. Willow uploaded a snap of herself and Harrison posing together in the studio, with the latter sharing a similar image on his Stories feed.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I love Willow, I think she&#x2019;s phenomenal&#x201D;, Yungblud said <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/curator/alt-ctrl-with-hanuman-welch/1481637548?ct=cur_am1_altctrl_gen&amp;ign-itscg=80170&amp;ign-itsct=cur_am1_altctrl_gen&amp;ls=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>in a new interview with Apple Music</strong></a>. &#x201C;I think she&#x2019;s very rare. I think she&#x2019;s got a voice like that will transcend for years to come. I think she&#x2019;s got something to say. And I think what&#x2019;s so sick about her is that it&#x2019;s another artist at the minute that&#x2019;s pushing rock and roll forward. I think she represents something and I think she represents something and she has something to say and I back it man.&#x201D;
</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFzq4_qCFUQ?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFzq4_qCFUQ?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>The song follows on from his previously released single &#x201C;The Funeral&#x201D; in March, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/yungblud-funeral-video-ozzy-sharon-osbourne/"><strong>the video of which featured Ozzy Osbourne</strong></a>. Both that and &#x201C;Memories&#x201D; are anticipated to appear on Yungblud&#x2019;s as-yet-untitled third studio album, which is expected to be released later this year.<br>
In July 2021, Willow made an appearance on The YUNGBLUD Podcast, where the pair talked about &#x201C;rock&#x2019;s evolution, the impact the music industry has had on their mental health, and how they&#x2019;re reclaiming their voices&#x201D;.
</p><p>&#x201C;For so long, I had a lot of fear,&#x201D; Willow said during the interview with Harrison. &#x201C;I felt extremely unsafe in my music career in the past and that feeling of insecurity or unsafety, like I didn&#x2019;t feel protected, which just went really deep.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s interesting because all of those memories and emotions have just been resurfacing,&#x201D; she continued. &#x201C;I was doing the<em> Jimmy Fallon</em> performance, and I had like a flashback of being like 10 or 9 and having an anxiety attack on set and basically feeling like everyone around me was like &#x2018;You&#x2019;re just a brat, why aren&#x2019;t you grateful?&#x2019;. They didn&#x2019;t see it as an anxiety attack &#x2013; they saw it as a tantrum, and now I look back and know it was an anxiety attack.&#x201D;

														<p>Brian May has today (5) released a new video featuring a Spanish language version of his song &#x201C;Another World&#x201D; entitled &#x201C;Otro Lugar.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s available now on his official YouTube channel.
</p><p>May gave lucky attendees a preview of the video at the recent launch of the <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/brian-may-another-world-remastered-reissue/"><strong>new, deluxe edition</strong></a> of his second solo album, 1998&#x2019;s <em>Another World</em>, at the Greenwich Planetarium in London. There he talked about why he had chosen to do this interpretation, which was originally released in its audio form on the 1999 compilation <em>Baladas 99</em>, alongside tracks by artists such as <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/robbie-williams/"><strong>Robbie Williams</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/joe-cocker/"><strong>Joe Cocker</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The guitar hero and singer-songwriter spoke in the native tongue of the Canary Islands, before translating: &#x201C;This is for you because the Spanish world has always been incredibly kind to us and to me.&#x201D;

<p>In the Spanish language video, May visits the Teide Observatory on Tenerife and sits alongside his <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/brian-may-back-tree-another-world-reissue/"><strong>much-loved tree</strong></a> on the island of El Hierro, memorably featured on the <em>Another World</em> album cover.
</p><p>Discussing the creation of the videos in Tenerife, he went on: &#x201C;We filmed two versions of &#x2018;Another World&#x2019; in the Canaries. In fact, we went out mainly to do the Spanish one at the beginning. So it&#x2019;s kind of fitting that the Spanish one turned out better than the English one! We managed to shoot a lot more in Spanish than in English, strangely enough, and maybe I worked harder on it, I don&#x2019;t know. But the shots just seem to come nicely together.&#x201D;
</p><p>May went on: &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re watching this (and you&#x2019;re English speaking), bear in mind that the Spanish words mean almost exactly the same as the English words. They&#x2019;re about a parallel universe and what could have happened in Another World.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;The tree is a great symbol for Another World for me, and we revisited it,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a really ancient tree. It&#x2019;s a kind of juniper, a Sabina, as they call it here. But its form is extraordinary &#x2013; it&#x2019;s grown in a very harsh environment with constant high winds. So the only way it has survived is by bending &#x2013; in a long sweeping curve, the tree resembles a beautiful woman with her head thrown back in the wind.
</p><h2>&#x2018;The gods have been with us&#x2019;</h2>
<p>&#x201C;So we had an amazing trip with these three islands and the gods have been with us. I don&#x2019;t know if someone&#x2019;s looking after us because everywhere we&#x2019;ve been, we&#x2019;ve had the perfect weather for the shots, and this video should be stupendous.&#x201D;
</p><p>He concluded: &#x201C;So this has been a dream for me, to revisit the places which fuelled my life and also fuelled the creation of this album <em>Another World</em>, particularly the pine forest which encircles the central volcano, El Teide. And that forest is a very special place for me, for many reasons. And that&#x2019;s the place I want to be when I leave this planet, because to me, it&#x2019;s the closest place to Heaven.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;Otro Lugar&#x201D; features as one of the tracks on <em>Another Disc</em>, which is included on the 2CD and box set formats of the <em>Another World</em> reissue and contains a special collection of remixes, rarities, and live tracks.
