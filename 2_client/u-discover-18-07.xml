<p>Grammy-and Oscar-winner <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/t-bone-burnett-jay-bellerose-keefus-ciancia-the-invisible-light-spells/">T Bone Burnett</a></strong>, Jay Bellerose, and Keefus Ciancia have released &#x201C;Mother Cross (We Think We Think),&#x201D; which will be featured on <em>The Invisible Light: Spells</em>. </p>
<p>The projectfeatures two very different versions of &#x201C;Mother Cross,&#x201D; including a reprise. The song brings to light the reason behind the false realities: fear, belief, and willing forgetfulness.<br>
This is the second installment of <em>The Invisible Light</em> trilogy, following 2019&#x2019;s acclaimed<em> The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space</em>. The album is set for release August 5 on Verve Forecast.</p>

<p><em>New York Times</em> raved of <em>The Invisible Light: Acoustic Space</em>, writing, &#x201C;Burnett speak-sings his way through free-associative songs that contain biblical allusions, echoes of the blues, tall tales, lovers&#x2019; plaints, and warnings about disinformation, the cult of personality and the encroachments of technology,&#x201D; while <em>Los Angeles Times</em> describes, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a significant departure, thematically, for this lifelong seeker of larger truths.&#x201D;</p>
<p><em>The Invisible Light</em> is a fusion of trance, electronic, folk, tribal, and global music. At the heart of this trilogy is technology and how it has advanced significantly throughout the course of the last century, with radio, film, television, and the internet serving as central parts of our lives. In acoustic space, people hear from every direction at once, the center is everywhere, and there is no border.</p>
<p>Multiple Grammy-and Oscar-winner Joseph Henry &#x2018;T Bone&#x2019; Burnett is a producer, musician, and songwriter. Burnett most recently released <em>Acoustic Space</em>, the first full-length installment in <em>The Invisible Light</em> trilogy, an experimental song cycle which explores the idea that society has been subject to a programming pandemic which is causing us to lose our ability to differentiate fact from fiction. </p>
<p>Burnett also composed and produced the music for critically acclaimed HBO series <em>True Detective</em>, and his film work includes the five-time Grammy winning soundtrack for <em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em>, <em>The Big Lebowski</em>, <em>Cold Mountain</em>, <em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>Crazy Heart</em>, and <em>Walk The Line</em>, among others. He has collaborated with numerous artists including Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, and Roy Orbison, and won Album of the Year and Record of the Year Grammy Awards for Robert Plant and Alison Krauss&#x2019; <em>Raising Sand</em>.</p>

<p>Recently, she made headlines by starring in <em>EMERGENCY</em>, which premiered at the 2022 Sundance Film Festival. She appeared as a guest on the <em>Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em> to discuss the movie as well as more upcoming music.</p>
<p>Sabrina also just launched her first fragrance, Sweet Tooth, in partnership with Scent Beauty. The gourmand fragrance, developed in partnership with Firmenich, features notes of chocolate marshmallow, vanilla, Chantilly cream, and sugared musks. The Discovery Size fragrance is available now, with the full-size Eau de Parfum to follow in September.</p>
<p>Showcasing Carpenter&#x2019;s artistic growth since the release of her redefining double album &#x2013; <em>Singular: Act I (2018)</em> and <em>Singular: Act II</em> (2019)&#x2014;<i>emails&#xA0;i can&#x2019;t</i> send&#x2014;features standout singles &#x201C;<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-fast-times-music-video/"><strong>Fast Times</strong></a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-skinny-dipping-music-video/"><strong>Skinny Dipping</strong></a>,&#x201D; in addition to &#x201C;Vicious.&#x201D; Each of the three tracks represent different elements of the singer&#x2019;s artistry, tackling full Teenage Dream pop on one, stripped back storytelling on another, and fierce post-breakup catharsis on the latter.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can say that everything is based on my life, so you&#x2019;re going to get some specific stories and memories, [and] that is actually quite terrifying,&#x201D; Carpenter told <em>British GQ</em> of the album earlier this year. &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve experienced both me being discontent and also happy, so I want to show that. It&#x2019;s going to be complex.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Organ great <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ronnie-foster-announces-first-album-in-36-years-reboot/">Ronnie Foster</a></strong> is back to Blue Note Records with <em>Reboot</em>, his first new album in 36 years, which arrives 50 years after his 1972 Blue Note debut <em>Two Headed Freap</em>. </p>
<p>The nine-song album was recorded at the legendary Capitol Studios and marks a fresh start for Foster, who has whipped up an omnidirectional brew of Hammond Organ Groove that pays homage to the past but more often reflects his restlessness for ushering in the new.</p>

<p>Listeners the world over have heard Foster&#x2019;s soulful playing, whether from his standout performance on &#x201C;Summer Soft&#x201D; from Stevie Wonder&#x2019;s 1976 masterwork <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ronnie-foster-stevie-wonder-she-lovely/"><em>Songs In The Key Of Life</em></a></strong>, best-selling George Benson albums including <em>Breezin&#x2019;</em>, or A Tribe Called Quest&#x2019;s classic hip-hop track &#x201C;Electric Relaxation&#x201D; which sampled Foster&#x2019;s &#x201C;Mystic Brew&#x201D; from <em>Two Headed Freap</em>, which was recently reissued as part of Blue Note&#x2019;s Classic Vinyl Reissue Series.</p>
<p>The Buffalo, New York born keyboardist first caught the ear of Blue Note co-founder Francis Wolff when he made his first-ever recording as a sideman on guitar legend Grant Green&#x2019;s searingly funky Blue Note LP, <em>Alive!</em> in 1970. After Wolff passed away a few months later, Ronnie was officially signed to Blue Note by George Butler making him the next in an illustrious lineage of Hammond B3 organ artisans the label had presented which included Jimmy Smith, Larry Young, and Dr. Lonnie Smith. </p>
<p><em>Two Headed Freap</em> was the first in a run of five stellar jazz-funk albums Foster would make for Blue Note throughout the 1970s including <em>Sweet Revival</em>, <em>Live: Cookin&#x2019; with Blue Note at Montreux</em>, <em>On the Avenue</em>, and <em>Cheshire Cat</em>.</p>
<p>Mightily hoisting the Blue Note organ torch once again, Foster gives thanks to the musical osmosis that was poured into him by all of the greats that preceded him. In the album&#x2019;s liner notes, Ronnie makes sure to pay homage to one very important person in his life who passed away in 2021: &#x201C;This album is dedicated to the memory of my brother, friend, Buffalo Homie, and hero Dr. Lonnie Smith, who was one of the best in the world on the Hammond B3 organ.&#x201D;</p>

<p>GRAMMY-nominated singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/alexander-23-aftershock-album-announcement/">Alexander 23</a></strong> has released his introspective full-length debut album, <em>Aftershock</em>. </p>
<p>The 11-track collection, which details the fallout of a breakup, showcases Alexander&#x2019;s impressive growth as a songwriter and his knack for capturing emotional depth. Of the project, he shares, &#x201C;My album is about the grieving process of a breakup. Being heartbroken, thinking you&#x2019;re over it when you&#x2019;re obviously not, meeting new people, questioning yourself and all your relationships. If the breakup was the emotional earthquake, the creation of this album was the emotional aftershock.&#x201D; In addition to the release of his album, Alexander shared a captivating cinematic visual for &#x201C;If We Were A Party.&#x201D;</p>

<p>Produced by Alexander and GRAMMY-winning producer Dan Nigro (Olivia Rodrigo, Conan Gray), <em>Aftershock</em> is an intense look inside the mind of the rising pop artist after an all-consuming breakup. It digs deep into his post-split mental state while also showing a touching empathy toward his ex, signaling his ever-growing maturity as an artist and as a person.  </p>
<p>Songs like the heartbreaking, fragile ode to a lost friend &#x201C;The Hardest Part&#x201D; and the anthemic &#x201C;Somebody&#x2019;s Nobody&#x201D; reveal the breadth of Alexander&#x2019;s inner life, with detailed lyrics that make his impassioned delivery land even harder. </p>
<p>Other tracks, like &#x201C;RIP You And Me,&#x201D; which features Charlie Puth on the piano, the harmony-rich &#x201C;Fall 2017 (What If),&#x201D; and the wild &#x201C;If We Were A Party,&#x201D; pair raw feeling with ingenious production, a powerful combination that shows why <em>PAPER Magazine</em> hailed him as someone who had &#x201C;struck a chord with his generation from the very beginning.&#x201D;</p>
<p>With <em>Aftershock</em>, Alexander 23 continues a whirlwind year that began when the pop savant released the Olivia Rodrigo co-write &#x201C;Hate Me If It Helps,&#x201D; and went on to include critical acclaim for singles like the &#x201C;Crash,&#x201D; as well as support slots for like-minded artists <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/alexander-23-john-mayer-tears-for-fears-performance/">John Mayer</a></strong> and Tate McRae.</p>

<p>Sydney/Eora-based <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/young-franco-rick-james-mary-jane-remix/">Young Franco</a></strong> and US-based rapper Pell are becoming an international duo that perfectly tap into and reflect the power of collaboration, with their fourth collaborative effort, &#x201C;Like That.&#x201D; They recorded the track alongside fellow Perth-raised, Berlin-based producer Jafunk.</p>
<p>Sonically, Young Franco and Jafunk combine to create a track that reflects the golden era of club driven rap music, pioneered in Virginia by production greats including <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/smino-zero-fatigue-pharrell-ice-cream-merch/">Pharrell</a></strong>, The Neptunes, and Timbaland. Its bounce-ready percussion runs perfectly with quickly strummed guitars and a slapping bass line. On the top line front, Pell is in no rush to get his slick bars off, gliding over the beat with an elegance and class before riding it out with an infectious hook.</p>

<p>Young Franco and Pell have a track record of creating successful musical outings. Their first track, &#x201C;Juice,&#x201D; spent nine weeks at the No.1 position on Spotify&#x2019;s flagship indie playlist Front Left, BBC Radio 1 Spins from Annie Mac and Molly King, as well as featuring as Zane Lowe&#x2019;s &#x2018;Next Wave&#x2019; artist on Beats1. </p>
<p>The duo followed their first hit &#x201C;Fallin&#x2019; Apart&#x201D; alongside <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/denzel-curry-ebro-darden-2022-juneteenth-freedom-songs/">Denzel Curry</a></strong>, which featured as the soundtrack for an Apple Airpods campaign, which was viewed over four million times.

In that period of time he soundtracked the new-look Australian Football League, and has received global syncs for brands including Apple, Starbucks, Topshop, and Kia. Currently, he&#x2019;s touring the United States and has locked in massive festival slots at Lollapalooza, Falls Festival, Spilt Milk, Lost Paradise. </p>

<p>BRIT Award-winning pop auteur <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/mabel-overthinking-24kgoldn/">Mabel</a></strong> has released her euphoric second album, <em>About Last Night&#x2026;</em></p>
<p>The record follows her 2019 debut album, <em>High Expectations,</em> and was conceived during the coronavirus-enforced lockdown. Instead of reflecting the four walls the world was being kept between, though, the record whisks listeners away on a night out, documenting the minutiae of night on the town &#x2013; from getting ready to stumbling home.</p>

<p>The feel-good blueprint of <em>About Last Night&#x2026;</em> was conceived between Mabel&#x2019;s West London home, Angelic studios in Oxford, and some of Los Angeles&#x2019; most inspiring creative spaces (including the former hilltop residence of Frank Sinatra). She also teamed up with an impeccable crew of songwriting partners, including the likes of Raye, MNEK, Kamille, and Jax Jones.</p>
<p>Among its tracks, &#x201C;Let Them Know&#x201D; documents getting dressed up with nowhere to go, while &#x201C;Good Luck&#x201D; mixed heartbreak with female solidarity in a dancefloor-ready banger. The second half of &#x2018;About Last Night&#x2026;&#x2019; enters more vulnerable territory, giving an unflinchingly honest snapshot of when nightlife meets social anxiety and how to find your way back to yourself.</p>

<p>The record has also received enthusiastic reviews across the board, with praise for its tracks coming from <em>The Sunday Times</em>, <em>The Face</em>, <em>The Guardian,</em> and more. In a four-star review, <em>NME</em> applauded the pop star, describing the album as &#x201C;self-assured&#x201D; and &#x201C;slick&#x201D;.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Like with any good party, Mabel knows when to call it,&#x201D; the review read. &#x201C;<em>About Last Night&#x2026;</em> leaves you with your ears ringing, hooks stuck in your head, and a healthy dose of dancefloor catharsis that&#x2019;ll make you feel lighter &#x2013; much like the jacket you forgot to collect from the cloakroom.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mabel shared her thoughts on <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/mabel-let-love-go-lil-tecca-apple-music/">how her music has evolved</a></strong> in an interview on Apple Music. &#x201C;I was tired&#x2026; I&#x2019;m so ambitious that sometimes I forget to like breathe&#x2026; and I think that drive and intense ambition has got me to where I am and there&#x2019;s so much more I want to achieve&#x201D;, she reflected.</p>
<p>&#x201C;It was never enough&#x2026;I started comparing myself to other artists. That and the combination with the scrutiny you experience online when you have a following. It was just too much. I feel in love with what I do. Just recognizing it &#x2013; that&#x2019;s most of the battle. And being like, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m so lucky to be able to do what I do&#x2019; but If I&#x2019;m not enjoying it. I took a little break and listened to a lot of music and just went back in and had this new spark and desire.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/jonas-blue-julian-perretta-perfect-melody/">Jonas Blue</a></strong> has linked up with Japanese boy band BE:FIRST for a Japanese version of his hit single &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Wake Me Up.&#x201D;</p>
<p>A heartwarming combination of Jonas&#x2019; production and BE:FIRST&#x2019;s Japanese vocals, the new version of &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Wake Me Up&#x201D; is a world-uniting delight. The viral original, a joint single with US outfit Why Don&#x2019;t We, has racked up a whopping 54 million Spotify streams. </p>

<p>It was the first release from <em>Together</em>, Jonas&#x2019; new collaborative project that will see a stream of new music dropped across the year alongside exciting global talent. All of these collaborations will center around togetherness, unity, and positivity&#x2014;themes synonymous with Jonas&#x2019; hugely successful music career to date.</p>
<p>Jonas&#x2019; stacked 2022 touring schedule includes a performance at the prestigious Fuji Rock Festival, Japan&#x2019;s largest outdoor festival, in Niigata Prefecture on July 29. Jonas will also be playing a residency in Las Vegas, festival performances, and shows in Ibiza, across the US, Europe, and more. He will additionally perform back-to-back sets at numerous festivals with Dutch DJ and producer Sam Feldt, his partner in their new collaborative project Endless Summer.</p>
<p>BE:FIRST are a seven-member outfit that formed through the reality competition show <em>The First</em>. Their pre-debut track, &#x201C;Shining One,&#x201D; was a smash hit that made its first appearance at No.1 in Download Songs, No.1 in Video Views, No.2 in Streaming, No.3 in Tweets, and No.2 in the overall song chart on <em>Billboard</em> Japan.</p>
<p>The single follows &#x201C;Perfect Melody,&#x201D; which found Blue teaming up with acclaimed British singer-songwriter Julian Perretta.</p>
<p>After meeting at a French festival in 2016, the two artists stayed in touch and&#x2014;as Blue began working on his forthcoming album, <em>Together</em>&#x2014;the door opened for them to finally collaborate. &#x201C;Perfect Melody&#x201D; is the perfect soundtrack for summer romance with Perretta&#x2019;s piercing yet playful vocals bobbing atop a soulful guitar, infectious beat and breezy keyboards.</p>

<p>DaniLeigh&#x2019;s growing legions of fans are still abuzz in the wake of her no-holds-barred My Side #No Filter in-depth interview a few weeks ago with iHeart Radio Power 95.1 on-air personality Angie Martinez. On the Friday release date of &#x201C;Dead To Me,&#x201D; DaniLeigh openly discussed her most intimate and challenging moments of the past two tumultuous years, her relationships, motherhood, and what&#x2019;s next for the artist.   </p>
<p><em>My Side</em>, with &#x201C;Dead To Me&#x201D; and &#x201C;Heartbreaker,&#x201D; is the first new music by DaniLeigh since her highly praised <em>Movie</em>&#x202F;album and film counterpart of 2020, which included her three single and video successes of that year: &#x201C;Levi High&#x201D;&#x202F;featuring&#x202F;DaBaby, (precursor to the&#x202F;&#x201C;Levi High Challenge&#x201D;&#x202F;TikTok compilation video); &#x201C;Dominican Mami&#x201D;&#x202F;featuring Fivio Foreign (whose sizzling video was shot on location in DaniLeigh&#x2019;s ancestral Dominican Republic); and &#x201C;Monique,&#x201D; soundtrack of Finish Line&#x2019;s #ShoesSoFresh high-profile campaign.&#x202F;In support of that campaign, DaniLeigh personally appeared in the Chapter 1 Parks Department&#x202F;video with&#x202F;Caleb McLaughlin&#x202F;and&#x202F;Lil Durk, which generated over 30 million&#x202F;streams and over 13 million&#x202F;YouTube views in its first three weeks.</p>
<p>BET Awards &#x201C;Best New Artist&#x201D; nominee and <em>Rolling Stone</em> Break&#xAD;through Artist DaniLeigh crossed over the prestigious one billion cumulative global streams threshold with her RIAA platinum smash singles &#x201C;Lil Bebe&#x201D; remix featuring Lil Baby (2018), and &#x201C;Easy&#x201D; remix featuring Chris Brown (2019).</p>
<p>Born Danielle Curiel to Dominican parents in Miami, DaniLeigh emerged under the watch of royalty when Prince handpicked her to direct the 2013 music video for &#x201C;Breakfast Can Wait.&#x201D; The late legend acted as her mentor as she developed a signature style. Upon signing to Def Jam in 2017, she dropped the single &#x201C;Can&#x2019;t Relate&#x201D; (featuring YBN, Nahmir, and YG).</p>

<p><em>The Ceiling Could Collapse</em>, which Bobbitt co-produced with Justice Der and was mixed by GRAMMY-nominee Jorge Elbrecht, was a long time coming. Bobbitt made a name for herself on Vine as a teenager, uploading covers of pop hits and all-time classics to the now-defunct social media site. As her profile rose, Bobbitt found herself overwhelmed rather than inspired. </p>
<p>&#x201C;It was exciting to be doing what I loved, but it was difficult to be observed by that many people at that age where I simultaneously wanted to just shut myself in,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m grateful it ended when it did, because it gave me time to step back and think about what I wanted to create for myself.&#x201D; She soon found herself at a jazz program, before leaving it during the pandemic to focus on her own music. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Every woman I&#x2019;ve ever talked to is in some amount of pain almost all the time,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;That could be physical pain, emotional pain, familial pain, but it&#x2019;s there in cycles.&#x201D; In addition to music, Bobbitt draws those same feelings from horror films&#x2014;and actually pulled the title to this EP while reading the script to 2018&#x2019;s <em>Hereditary</em>. A deleted scene offered a revelation: &#x201C;We need to accept that we can&#x2019;t have our minds fixated on all these things that could happen, and we need to move on&#x2014;but also the ceiling could just collapse,&#x201D; Bobbitt says and laughs. </p>
<p>More than unpredictability, it&#x2019;s the endless repetition of life that suggests both things are true, that there&#x2019;s no reason to worry and something terrible is about to happen. The ceiling collapse may be inescapable, but once it&#x2019;s gone, there&#x2019;s just more room for the sunrise to peek through.</p>

<p>A piano-driven vocal and songwriting showcase for Natalie Jane, &#x201C;Mentally Cheating&#x201D; is about the beginning of the end of a relationship. &#x201C;I think I shouldn&#x2019;t be looking in those eyes, why do they give me butterflies?&#x201D; the New Jersey teenager ponders over striking chords. On the chorus, which has resonated with listeners across social media platforms, she admits that somebody else has caught her attention: &#x201C;I think I&#x2019;m mentally cheating.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Mentally Cheating&#x201D; follows a series of hit independent releases from Natalie that includes &#x201C;Kind of Love&#x201D; (7M+ Spotify streams), &#x201C;Bloodline,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Red Flag.&#x201D; Those songs established the breakout star&#x2019;s knack for brutally honest, unfiltered lyrics and irresistible pop hooks. It&#x2019;s a skill set she has acquired through years of experience. </p>
<p>Most recently, the talented singer/songwriter has built momentum by focusing on authentically engaging with fans on social media. Natalie Jane is particularly active on TikTok, where her raw, heartfelt original songs and stunning cover versions have earned her more than 1.5M followers and over 40M likes. With &#x201C;Mentally Cheating,&#x201D; she is destined to expand her audience even further, taking another step towards seemingly inevitable pop stardom.</p>
<p>At just 18 years old, Jane has already created a distinct sound for herself characterized by bold, fearless lyrics that express the pain of heartbreak and the frustrating search for meaning in an increasingly overindulgent world. Natalie&#x2019;s dedication to music and a desire to hone her craft has taken her from her early childhood singing and songwriting, all while following her passion for transforming abstract concepts into music&#x2014;giving a voice to those almost indescribable moments.</p>
