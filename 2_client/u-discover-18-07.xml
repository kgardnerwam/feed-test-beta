        <![CDATA[
                        <p>The explosive musical cocktail that was the combination of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/ella-fitzgerald/"><strong>Ella Fitzgerald</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/duke-ellington/"><strong>Duke Ellington</strong></a> can be seen in action on a vintage clip newly shared from the rich archives of <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em>.</p>
<p>The jazz giants, with Duke’s orchestra, perform a medley of "I’m Beginning To See The Light,” “I Got It Bad (And That Ain’t Good),” “Don’t Get Around Much Anymore,” “Mood Indigo,” and “Cottontail” on the March 7, 1965 edition of the storied, long-running variety show. Their fellow guests that week were Italian-Swiss singer Rita Pavone and husband and wife comedy team Stiller &amp; Meara, featuring Jerry Stiller, father of actor Ben.</p>

<p>Fitzgerald, soon to turn 48 at the time of the broadcast, was coming towards the end of her reign at Verve Records, before she signed a new deal with Capitol, while Ellington was about to reach his 66th birthday. The pair had first recorded together in 1957, on the revered Verve release <em>Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Song Book</em>, which won her a Grammy award.</p>
<p><strong>Watch all the latest archival videos from <em>The Ed Sullivan Show</em> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDUNe-NZaknJOGyulc4Ohvg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the program’s official YouTube channel.</a></strong></p>
<p>Later in 1965, they would renew that studio relationship with another Verve set, <em>Ella At Duke’s Place</em>, on which they, and Ellington’s orchestra, performed songs by the bandleader, as well as material by Billy Strayhorn, Paul Francis Webster, and others. Ella and Duke’s live shows together in 1966 were also commemorated on <em>Ella and Duke at the Cote D’Azur</em>, released in 1967, and <em>The Stockholm Concert, 1966</em>, which wasn’t released until 1984.</p>
<p>The time of the Sullivan performance was also the period in which Fitzgerald, like so many artists, was influenced by the all-encompassing success of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-beatles/"><strong>The Beatles</strong></a>. She had released her version of “Can’t Buy Me Love” in 1964 – an honor that <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/paul-mccartney-and-wings/"><strong>Paul McCartney</strong></a> described as one of the greatest of his career – and in 1965 she “bubbled under” the Hot 100 with the novelty song “Ringo Beat.”</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/beastie-boys/"><strong>Beastie Boys</strong></a> are being honored with a new street name in New York City.</p>
<p>The street – on the Lower East Side corner of Ludlow Street and Rivington Street – will be renamed in the band’s honor, after being approved by the New York City Council.</p>
<p>The street was made famous by the band on the cover of their critically-acclaimed second album, 1989’s <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-100-greatest-album-covers/"><strong><em>Paul’s Boutique</em></strong></a>. The new sign will recognize the achievements of Michael “Mike D” Diamond, Adam “Ad-Rock” Horovitz, and the late Adam “MCA” Yauch.</p>
<p>“As many of us know, once the Beastie Boys hit the scene, it really changed the hip-hop game,” said council member Christopher Marte. “I see it as a celebration. A celebration for the Lower East Side, a celebration for hip-hop, and especially a celebration for our community who has been organising for a really long time to make this happen.”</p>
<p>Back in May, it was revealed that Beastie Boys will reissue the limited edition 4xLP version of their 1992 album <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/rediscover-beastie-boys-check-your-head/"><strong><em>Check Your Head</em></strong></a> to celebrate its 30th anniversary this year.</p>
<p>The record, which originally arrived in April 1992, was the trio’s third studio album and featured such tracks as "Pass The Mic", "So What’cha Want" and "Jimmy James".</p>
<p>Last Friday, July 15, Beastie Boys, via UMe, released a limited edition reissue of the rare 4xLP deluxe version of<em> Check Your Head</em>, which was originally released in 2009 as an artist store exclusive. The previously out-of-print box set includes the 2009 remaster of the original double album plus two extra LPs of bonus content, including remixes, live versions and B-sides.</p>
<p>All four LPs will be pressed on 180-gram vinyl and housed in a fabric-wrapped and stamped hardcover case.</p>
<p>Back in April, protesters played Beastie Boys’ “(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)” outside 10 Downing Street after Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak were given fines by the Metropolitan Police for breaking COVID lockdown rules while attending parties at Downing Street and Whitehall.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Considering the latter-day, beloved status that <strong><a title="John Lennon" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/john-lennon">John Lennon</a> </strong>enjoyed<strong> </strong>as a world citizen who promoted peace and harmony, it almost beggars belief that on July 18, 1974, the former <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-beatles"><strong>Beatle</strong></a> was officially told (again) to get out of the United States.</p>
<p>That was the day newspapers reported that Lennon had been told by the Board of Immigration Appeals that he had until September 10 to leave the country or face deportation. Not exactly the news he wanted to hear, as he set to work at the Record Plant studio in New York, self-producing what would become his <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/behind-the-albums/john-lennon-walls-and-bridges/"><strong>fifth studio album</strong></a>, <em>Walls and Bridges</em>.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zZsKOvXiFo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>The board dismissed Lennon’s petition to delay its decision until the conclusion of pending lawsuits that contested his deportation. But Leon Wildes, John’s lawyer, said that an appeal would be filed and it “would be years before the case is resolved.” Lennon’s wife, Yoko Ono, was granted permission to stay in the US as a permanent resident alien.</p>
<h2>A threat to Nixon?</h2>
<p>John’s high profile, anti-Vietnam War protests and peace campaigning had made him a thorn in the side of the US authorities for years. Although it now seems an absurd suggestion, President Richard Nixon actually believed at the time that they could damage his chances of re-election.</p>
<p>Lennon was challenging the order the previous year by a federal immigration judge that required him to leave the country because of his UK conviction in 1968 for possession of marijuana. The events surrounding his battle to stay in the States would become the subject of the 2006 film <em>The US vs. John Lennon.</em></p>
<h2>‘We are not unsympathetic’</h2>
<p>The Board of Immigration voted by four to nil to issue the ruling, with one member not participating. “We are not unsympathetic to the plight of the respondent and others in a similar situation under the immigration laws, who have committed only one marijuana violation for which a fine was imposed,” they wrote. “Nevertheless, arguments for a change in the law must be addressed to the legislative, rather than the executive branch of government.”</p>

<p>As events turned out, by the time Lennon made his appeal on August 31, Nixon had resigned over the Watergate scandal, and his successor Gerald Ford showed little appetite to continue deportation proceedings. <em>Walls and Bridges</em> was duly released at the end of September, and the following year, the order was overturned by New York State Supreme Court judge Irving Kaufman.</p>
<p>“The courts will not condone selective deportation based upon secret political grounds,” said Kaufman in his ruling. He added: “Lennon’s four-year battle to remain in our country is a testimony to his faith in this American dream.” In 1976, John was finally given his green card.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>HBO have shared the first teaser trailer for <em>The Idol</em> – the forthcoming drama series created by “the sick and twisted minds of” <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-weeknd/"><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a> (aka Abel Tesfaye) and<em> Euphoria</em> helmer Sam Levinson.</p>
<p>Tesfaye will star in the series as a self-help guru, club owner and leader of a modern-day cult, who begins dating an up-and-coming pop artist played by Lily-Rose Depp. Little else is known about the story driving <em>The Idol</em>, but according to its trailer, the series will chronicle “the sleaziest love story in all of Hollywood”.</p>
<p>Across just over a minute of footage, viewers are presented with an onslaught of sex, drugs, violence, corruption, choreographed dancing and the declaration that “there’s nothing about [Depp’s as-yet-unnamed character] that’s relatable”. You can watch the trailer below.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wRyHnzFn4HM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<p>A premiere date for <em>The Idol</em> is yet to be announced, though it’s slated to arrive on HBO Max sometime before the year’s end. The first season will consist of six episodes, with the main cast also set to feature Troye Sivan, ex-Disney Channel luminary Debby Ryan and <em>Transparent</em> breakout star Hari Nef.</p>
<p>The recurring cast will bolstered by a slate of Tesfaye’s musical colleagues, including Tunde Adebimpe of TV On The Radio, Jennie Kim of Blackpink and Tyson Ritter of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-all-american-rejects/"><strong>The All-American Rejects</strong></a>.</p>
<p>The show itself was announced last June and began filming that November. Back in April, it was reported that extensive reshoots would be taken out to overhaul its creative direction; HBO confirmed as much, saying in a statement that the series was “adjusting” its cast and crew to serve a new direction.</p>
<p>Tesfaye already has a few acting credits to his name. He previously played himself in Josh and Benny Safdie’s 2019 thriller <em>Uncut Gems</em> (where he appeared opposite Adam Sandler), and also made guest appearances in <em>American Dad</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em>.</p>
<p>As The Weeknd, Tesfaye is currently on tour across North America, performing shows on the long-delayed ‘After Hours Til Dawn’ run. It began in Philadelphia on Tuesday (July 14), following the cancellation of a planned gig in Toronto; when Tesfaye learned that a six-year-old boy was distraught over the cancellation, he flew the kid out to see him perform in Philadelphia.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Martha Rose Reeves, born on July 18, 1941,  tirelessly carries the Motown torch forward as one of the relatively few representatives of its classic era still performing live on a regular basis. Not bad for someone who started out as a secretary at the label and was then a backing vocalist. She sang with her group mates alongside an up-and-coming Tamla notable called <a title="Marvin Gaye" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/marvin-gaye"><strong>Marvin Gaye</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Motown and Motor City Fanclub, a group of hardcore devotees of the company’s history not given to favouring big Tamla hits just because they were famous, conducted a poll of its members. They were asked to name their favorite Motown singles of all time, and it’s a huge testament to <a title="Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/martha-reeves-the-vandellas"><strong>Martha and the Vandellas</strong></a> that they had two of the Top 6 titles, three of the Top 11 and four of the Top 20.</p>
<p><a title="The Temptations" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-temptations"><strong>The Temptations</strong></a>’ <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-temptations-my-girl-motown-song/"><strong>“My Girl”</strong></a> was at No.1 and the Contours’ great, lesser-known “Just A Little Misunderstanding” at No.2 in that list. Then Reeves and the group landed at No.3 with <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/martha-vandellas-nowhere-to-run-song/"><strong>“Nowhere To Run,”</strong></a> No.6 with <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/martha-vandellas-turn-up-heat/"><strong>“Heatwave,”</strong></a> No.11 with <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/martha-reeves-vandellas-dancing-in-the-street/"><strong>“Dancing In The Street”</strong></a> and No.20 with “Jimmy Mack.”</p>

<p>Four more great Martha and the Vandellas that are less talked about these days also placed inside that prestigious and carefully-chosen Top 100 poll. They were “I’m Ready For Love,” “Quicksand,” “Lovebug Leave My Heart Alone,” and “My Baby Loves Me.” The group also have the distinction that their single “I’ll Have To Let Him Go” (their first release under the group name in the US, on Gordy in 1962) is one of the rarest and most collectable of all Motown single releases in the UK.</p>
<h2>Rock and Roll Hall of Famers</h2>
<p>Only the second all-female group to be inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, Martha and the Vandellas remained on Motown into the early 1970s, after which Reeves pursued her solo career for some years and hit the US R&amp;B Top 30 in 1974 with the MCA single “Power Of Love.”</p>

<p>Later reunions and line-ups of the Vandellas help to keep those towering original hits alive to this day, and let’s not forget how Martha has stayed true to her Detroit roots throughout her life, serving as a city councillor for four years from 2005. Amid her continued touring, it was announced in June 2021 that she was to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In November, she was pictured hanging backstage at the Detroit concert by one of the groups for whom she, and Motown, were an early inspiration, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-rolling-stones/">the Rolling Stones</a>.</strong></p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Glass Animals have announced details of a tiny London show to “re-launch” <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/glass-animals-new-album-dreamland/"><strong>their acclaimed 2020 album</strong></a> <em>Dreamland</em>.</p>
<p>The band played Shoreditch venue Village Underground in early 2020, just before the pandemic hit, to preview cuts from what would become their third album. Now, Glass Animals have announced a small gig at the same London venue on August 25 to carry through “some of the things that were in our original plan” that were scuppered because of COVID. <a href="https://dice.fm/event/5yrkk-glass-animals-live-village-underground-25th-aug-village-underground-london-tickets?pid=530cb286&amp;_branch_match_id=1068453203972801848&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz8nMy9ZLyUxO1UvL1c8zMzZMNrVMTk1KsbAvyEyxNTU2SE4ysjADAPKn6MYuAAAA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tickets for the event</strong></a> are now available.</p>
<p>Frontman Dave Bayley explained: “Back in 2020 we had this delicately constructed, intricate plan to launch <em>Dreamland</em> with a bunch of special shows, signings and real-life events.</p>
<p>“Then… we got spanked by the pandemic and we had to tear our plan in half. I was pretty damn sad for a bit, but eventually the support from everyone on the web was so great that it pulled me out of my mind-hole and I realized we could make a new plan… One based on the magnificent wonder that is the internet.”</p>
<p>The frontman added: “We did that and it was absolutely wicked, but I still feel like we missed out on the IRL stuff. So, we thought we’d just have another go of it. This is our chance to do some of the things that were in our original plan, for the fans who have been there with us every step of the way.”</p>
<p>Last week, meanwhile, the Oxford band cancelled both their Mad Cool and NOS Alive festival sets due to illness. Bayley said he was “gutted” to cancel the shows but had no option due to issues with his vocal cords.</p>
<p>“Gutted to say we have to cancel our shows tomorrow and the following day in Madrid and Lisbon,” he wrote. “I absolutely hate cancelling shows, but my vocal cords have had it.”</p>
<p>Earlier that week, the band called out British Airways after the band’s music equipment was misplaced while in transit.</p>
<p>For over a week, the band have been without vital music making equipment, leading them to miss deadlines. Despite Bayley calling out the airlines in a series of tweets, the equipment has still not been returned at the time of writing.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Rising 18-year-old pop star Natalie Jane has released her hotly anticipated new single, “Mentally Cheating.” The single is out now via Capitol Records and <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/aitch-1989/">10K Projects</a></strong>. </p>
<p>The hugely relatable anthem, which finds the newcomer grappling with temptation, is already a phenomenon on TikTok via multiple teasers, resulting in more than 6M likes, 115K pre-saves, and 25K shares.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wt4iUr9_9aM?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p>A piano-driven vocal and songwriting showcase for Natalie Jane, “Mentally Cheating” is about the beginning of the end of a relationship. “I think I shouldn’t be looking in those eyes, why do they give me butterflies?” the New Jersey teenager ponders over striking chords. On the chorus, which has resonated with listeners across social media platforms, she admits that somebody else has caught her attention: “I think I’m mentally cheating.”</p>
<p>“Mentally Cheating” follows a series of hit independent releases from Natalie that includes “Kind of Love” (7M+ Spotify streams), “Bloodline,” and “Red Flag.” Those songs established the breakout star’s knack for brutally honest, unfiltered lyrics and irresistible pop hooks. It’s a skill set she has acquired through years of experience. </p>
<p>Most recently, the talented singer/songwriter has built momentum by focusing on authentically engaging with fans on social media. Natalie Jane is particularly active on TikTok, where her raw, heartfelt original songs and stunning cover versions have earned her more than 1.5M followers and over 40M likes. With “Mentally Cheating,” she is destined to expand her audience even further, taking another step towards seemingly inevitable pop stardom.</p>
<p>At just 18 years old, Jane has already created a distinct sound for herself characterized by bold, fearless lyrics that express the pain of heartbreak and the frustrating search for meaning in an increasingly overindulgent world. Natalie’s dedication to music and a desire to hone her craft has taken her from her early childhood singing and songwriting, all while following her passion for transforming abstract concepts into music—giving a voice to those almost indescribable moments.</p>

        Rachel Bobbitt Shares New EP ‘The Ceiling Could Collapse’

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Emerging Toronto-based artist <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/rachel-bobbitt-what-about-the-kids/">Rachel Bobbitt</a></strong> has released her excellent new EP The Ceiling Could Collapse today via Fantasy Records. </p>
<p>The EP centers on the cycles of life and how we find meaning in extremes: pain, joy, wonder, love. The result is a remarkable collection of songs that introduces a striking new talent. The EP’s singles “More,” “Watch and See,” “What About The Kids,” and “Gemini Ties,” showcase Bobbitt’s songwriting prowess.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/IoFCUCNJb0Q?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p><em>The Ceiling Could Collapse</em>, which Bobbitt co-produced with Justice Der and was mixed by GRAMMY-nominee Jorge Elbrecht, was a long time coming. Bobbitt made a name for herself on Vine as a teenager, uploading covers of pop hits and all-time classics to the now-defunct social media site. As her profile rose, Bobbitt found herself overwhelmed rather than inspired. </p>
<p>“It was exciting to be doing what I loved, but it was difficult to be observed by that many people at that age where I simultaneously wanted to just shut myself in,” she says. “I’m grateful it ended when it did, because it gave me time to step back and think about what I wanted to create for myself.” She soon found herself at a jazz program, before leaving it during the pandemic to focus on her own music. </p>
<p>“Every woman I’ve ever talked to is in some amount of pain almost all the time,” she says. “That could be physical pain, emotional pain, familial pain, but it’s there in cycles.” In addition to music, Bobbitt draws those same feelings from horror films—and actually pulled the title to this EP while reading the script to 2018’s <em>Hereditary</em>. A deleted scene offered a revelation: “We need to accept that we can’t have our minds fixated on all these things that could happen, and we need to move on—but also the ceiling could just collapse,” Bobbitt says and laughs. </p>
<p>More than unpredictability, it’s the endless repetition of life that suggests both things are true, that there’s no reason to worry and something terrible is about to happen. The ceiling collapse may be inescapable, but once it’s gone, there’s just more room for the sunrise to peek through.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Buzzworthy singer and songwriter, dancer, choreographer, and producer <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/def-jam-recordings-the-women-of-def-jam/">DaniLeigh</a></strong> begins the final-week countdown to the July 22 arrival of her aptly-titled new EP, <em>My Side</em>, with another teaser in the form of “Heartbreaker.” Pre-orders for the new Def Jam Recordings release are now available.</p>
<p>DaniLeigh made her long-awaited return in May with the heartbreakingly honest single, “Dead To Me,” whose video premiered across all platforms earlier this week.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/c0pnHdTZi3Y?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p>DaniLeigh’s growing legions of fans are still abuzz in the wake of her no-holds-barred My Side #No Filter in-depth interview a few weeks ago with iHeart Radio Power 95.1 on-air personality Angie Martinez. On the Friday release date of “Dead To Me,” DaniLeigh openly discussed her most intimate and challenging moments of the past two tumultuous years, her relationships, motherhood, and what’s next for the artist.   </p>
<p><em>My Side</em>, with “Dead To Me” and “Heartbreaker,” is the first new music by DaniLeigh since her highly praised <em>Movie</em> album and film counterpart of 2020, which included her three single and video successes of that year: “Levi High” featuring DaBaby, (precursor to the “Levi High Challenge” TikTok compilation video); “Dominican Mami” featuring Fivio Foreign (whose sizzling video was shot on location in DaniLeigh’s ancestral Dominican Republic); and “Monique,” soundtrack of Finish Line’s #ShoesSoFresh high-profile campaign. In support of that campaign, DaniLeigh personally appeared in the Chapter 1 Parks Department video with Caleb McLaughlin and Lil Durk, which generated over 30 million streams and over 13 million YouTube views in its first three weeks.</p>
<p>BET Awards “Best New Artist” nominee and <em>Rolling Stone</em> Break­through Artist DaniLeigh crossed over the prestigious one billion cumulative global streams threshold with her RIAA platinum smash singles “Lil Bebe” remix featuring Lil Baby (2018), and “Easy” remix featuring Chris Brown (2019).</p>
<p>Born Danielle Curiel to Dominican parents in Miami, DaniLeigh emerged under the watch of royalty when Prince handpicked her to direct the 2013 music video for “Breakfast Can Wait.” The late legend acted as her mentor as she developed a signature style. Upon signing to Def Jam in 2017, she dropped the single “Can’t Relate” (featuring YBN, Nahmir, and YG).</p>

                        <p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/jonas-blue-julian-perretta-perfect-melody/">Jonas Blue</a></strong> has linked up with Japanese boy band BE:FIRST for a Japanese version of his hit single “Don’t Wake Me Up.”</p>
<p>A heartwarming combination of Jonas’ production and BE:FIRST’s Japanese vocals, the new version of “Don’t Wake Me Up” is a world-uniting delight. The viral original, a joint single with US outfit Why Don’t We, has racked up a whopping 54 million Spotify streams. </p>
<p>It was the first release from <em>Together</em>, Jonas’ new collaborative project that will see a stream of new music dropped across the year alongside exciting global talent. All of these collaborations will center around togetherness, unity, and positivity—themes synonymous with Jonas’ hugely successful music career to date.</p>
<p>Jonas’ stacked 2022 touring schedule includes a performance at the prestigious Fuji Rock Festival, Japan’s largest outdoor festival, in Niigata Prefecture on July 29. Jonas will also be playing a residency in Las Vegas, festival performances, and shows in Ibiza, across the US, Europe, and more. He will additionally perform back-to-back sets at numerous festivals with Dutch DJ and producer Sam Feldt, his partner in their new collaborative project Endless Summer.</p>
<p>BE:FIRST are a seven-member outfit that formed through the reality competition show <em>The First</em>. Their pre-debut track, “Shining One,” was a smash hit that made its first appearance at No.1 in Download Songs, No.1 in Video Views, No.2 in Streaming, No.3 in Tweets, and No.2 in the overall song chart on <em>Billboard</em> Japan.</p>
<p>The single follows “Perfect Melody,” which found Blue teaming up with acclaimed British singer-songwriter Julian Perretta.</p>
<p>After meeting at a French festival in 2016, the two artists stayed in touch and—as Blue began working on his forthcoming album, <em>Together</em>—the door opened for them to finally collaborate. “Perfect Melody” is the perfect soundtrack for summer romance with Perretta’s piercing yet playful vocals bobbing atop a soulful guitar, infectious beat and breezy keyboards.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p><strong><a title="John Coltrane" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/john-coltrane">John Coltrane</a></strong> died on July 17, 1967, having given more to jazz in his 40 years than many who live a much longer life. His music has been an inspiration to many rock musicians as well as younger jazz musicians and his album, <em><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/john-coltrane-a-love-supreme-explained/">A Love Supreme</a></strong>,</em> is one of the acknowledged masterpieces in the jazz canon.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the best of John Coltrane on <a href="https://music.apple.com/gb/playlist/john-coltrane-essentials/pl.c3153f44394b41b09d8cc23d929d1058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/johncoltranevip/playlist/5zwzWwR35iZMCtO2TT5eDG?si=mRfn0tdlTrCuYHwIROuzTA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>An aptitude for music</h2>
<p>Born in North Carolina in September 1926, Coltrane's father was a tailor and amateur musician able to play several instruments. Coltrane also showed an aptitude for music, studying the E-flat tenor (alto) horn, clarinet, and alto saxophone in high school. Both of his grandparents had been Methodist ministers, and his maternal grandfather had been a famous gospel preacher throughout that part of the Deep South.</p>
<p>Churchgoing was part of his upbringing and gospel music provided the soundtrack. When he was thirteen, both his father and grandfather died within a month of each other and after Coltrane graduated from high school in 1943, the family moved north to Philadelphia to make a new start. There he studied at the Ornstein School of Music and Granoff Studios, before making his professional debut in 1945 playing in a lounge band.</p>
<p>Following a short term serving in the Navy, Coltrane returned home, and having played in the Navy band while stationed in Hawaii (1945–1946), he expressed an earnest interest in the alto saxophone. He worked with a series of bands over the following decade including Eddie Vinson (1947–1948), and he played alto and tenor with Dizzy Gillespie (1949–1951) and Earl Bostic (1952–1953). His first proper recording session was with drummer Teddy Stewart’s Orchestra – made up mostly of Dizzy’s band members – backing <a title="Dinah Washington" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/dinah-washington"><strong>Dinah Washington</strong></a> on some singles for Mercury.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ys9wiGNDCvA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>From 1953, Coltrane focused on tenor saxophone, playing with Johnny Hodges from 1953 to 1954; during this time he appeared on several of Hodges’ Norgran albums. In 1955, Coltrane secured the gig that brought him to a wider audience, playing in Miles Davis’ new quintet, with Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones.</p>
<h2>A spiritual awakening</h2>
<p>Coltrane cited 1957 as the year of his spiritual awakening when he rid himself of heroin and alcohol addictions, catalyzed by being sacked from Miles Davis’ Quintet. Coltrane had previously been fired by Gillespie for his escalating drug-taking, and this time losing such a great gig and experiencing a near overdose was the wake-up call that he needed. He went cold turkey and cleaned up. After some tough times straightening himself out, he soon returned to play the second half of 1957 with <a title="Thelonious Monk" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/thelonious-monk"><strong>Thelonious Monk</strong></a>’s Quartet, before once again joining Davis at the beginning of 1958.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-N4w9LVGpw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>Ever humble and highly self-critical, Coltrane was perennially searching for truth in music, an ultimate statement. Between sets, he could be known to walk ten blocks and stare at the night sky through binoculars, in a constant search for inspiration and universal truth. His musical search mechanism worked by rehashing and rephrasing each musical concept in every one of its permutations. This approach initially led to his ‘sheets of sound’, a term coined by jazz critic Ira Gitler in 1958 for Coltrane’s album <em>Soultrane</em>, to describe his innovative improvisational style of repeating rapid-fire arpeggios with minuscule variations. While the evolution of his music was appreciated by many critics and fellow musicians, it was not readily accepted by the public; it all sounded too alien.</p>
<p>From March 21 through April 10, 1960, the Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb lineup of the <a title="Miles Davis" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/miles-davis"><strong>Miles Davis</strong></a> Quintet toured Europe, along with the Oscar Peterson and Stan Getz’s groups on a Jazz At The Philharmonic tour. At the Olympia Theatre, Paris, Coltrane’s solo spots were booed and the audience heckled. When Coltrane returned to Paris in 1962, playing even more adventurously, it was to only cheers.</p>
<h2>Leading his own sessions</h2>
<p>While with Davis, Coltrane had been beginning to lead his own recording sessions, giving him an increasing opportunity to air his own compositions; ‘Blue Train’ established him as a brilliant composer as well as a player. His earliest recordings were for the Prestige label; among the highlights was The Cats from 1957, the same year as he cut <em>Blue Train</em> for Blue Note Records. His debut for Creed Taylor’s Impulse! label came in 1961 when he made Africa/Brass; shortly afterward he recorded the beautiful Ballads. Two years later, he did John Coltrane And Johnny Hartman, the singer being the perfect foil for Trane’s tenor saxophone.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TMvbUKqWYEs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h2>A Love Supreme</h2>
<p>Then in December 1964, he recorded a piece of music composed in the comparative peace and calm to be found in Dix Hills, Long Island, about thirty miles from Manhattan. <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/new-releases/a-love-supreme/"><strong><em>A Love Supreme</em> </strong></a>was the sermon that Coltrane had pledged to his God if he made it through cold turkey. It was a literal expression of worship; a devotional poem that he had written and had reproduced in the gatefold sleeve of the album is expressed syllable by syllable on the saxophone as a “musical narration” in the final track “Part 4: ‘Psalm.”</p>
<p>The group for the session was what became known as the ‘Classic Quartet’ with <a title="McCoy Tyner" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/mccoy-tyner"><strong>McCoy Tyner</strong></a>, Elvin Jones, and Jimmy Garrison, all of whom had been with Coltrane in various lineups since the early 1960s. Anyone working with Coltrane soon learned that they would need to be dedicated and have considerable stamina to keep up. Because Coltrane was terrified of flying, the group would always travel by road, spending six weeks on a coast-to-coast tour, then immediately beginning a six-week residency in New York, often at the Half-Note at 289 Hudson Street.</p>
<p>Purified of drugs, Coltrane did still have one vice – overeating – food became a comfort for him to assuage the rigors of constantly performing. Legend also has it that Coltrane ate so many mint humbugs that his saxophone keys clogged up with sugar.</p>
<h2>Mind-altering experimentation</h2>
<p>However, Coltrane wasn’t entirely finished with mind-altering substances. The extremism in his music, the alien discordance, and the look to the East for spiritual meaning was partly fuelled by his increasing use of LSD. His experimentation with music started taking on many extra layers, so much so that the loyalty of his trusty colleagues was being tested. The beginning of the end for Tyner and Jones was the <em>Ascension</em> session (1965) where they complained that all they could hear was noise.</p>
<p>In 1966, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/astral-jazz-music-on-a-higher-plane/"><strong>Alice Coltrane</strong></a> – Coltrane had married the pianist earlier in the year, having recently divorced his first wife – and Rashied Ali replaced the departing duo, performing and recording in various combinations until Coltrane's death from cancer of the liver. When asked how he would like to be remembered, he replied, "As a saint." He passed away on July 17, 1967, in Huntington, New York.</p>
<p><em>"All a musician can do is to get closer to the sources of nature, and so feel that he is in communion with the natural laws." </em>– John Coltrane.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>One of the most iconic songs of the 60s was not sung by a dynamic, charismatic singer like Aretha Franklin or <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-rolling-stones/"><strong>Mick Jagger</strong></a>. There was no breathtaking guitar solo by the likes of Jimi Hendrix or <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/eric-clapton/"><strong>Eric Clapton</strong></a>. It was not composed by <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/burt-bacharach/"><strong>Burt Bacharach</strong></a> or arranged by <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/genre/johnny-mercer/"><strong>Johnny Mercer</strong></a>. The best-known visuals associated with the song, in fact, were a cartoon adolescent playing it on a toy piano, a crabby girl hanging out with him, and a beagle with a wicked happy dance.</p>
<p>The song is “Linus and Lucy,” one of the signature tunes of the Peanuts gang’s many television shows and movies. It’s one of several songs that are as closely associated with Peanuts as Linus’s security blanket or the jagged streak on Charlie Brown’s shirt. It’s among the most famous piano-led pieces of all time.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6zypc_LhnM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>This remarkable music was composed and recorded by Vince Guaraldi, a Bay Area-based jazz pianist whose ensembles played the tracks on the Peanuts television shows and movies.</p>
<p>Guaraldi’s path to creating the music for Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Peppermint Patty, et al. was a circuitous one; it is easy to imagine Linus explaining it all. Guaraldi was born in San Francisco and grew up in the city’s North Beach area, which nurtured his musical ambitions as did his maternal uncle, the whistler and singer Muzzy Marcellino. After a stint in the Army as a cook during the Korean War, Guaraldi got a gig in bands led by vibraphonist Cal Tjader, whose sound was especially influenced by Latin styles. This was a particularly good fit for Guaraldi’s interests. One of his first groups as a leader in the late 50s featured Mongo Santamaria and Willie Bobo, both of whom would go onto legendary careers. The pianist also worked with <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/stan-getz/"><strong>Stan Getz</strong></a>, who would become a central figure in popularizing bossa nova in the United States.</p>
<p>Guaraldi was also fascinated with bossa nova, and in 1962, Fantasy Records released the pianist’s third recording as a leader, <em>Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus</em>, which recast the soundtrack of the immensely popular 1959 movie. To fill out the album, Guaraldi added an original, “Cast Your Fate to the Wind,” and it was then issued as the B-side to “Samba de Orpheus.” Local deejays preferred the B-side and “Cast Your Fate,” a gently melodic tune with a touch of Latin influence became a crossover hit. It won the 1963 Grammy Award for Best Original Jazz Composition.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e9Krl9nnXT4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<h2>How Guaraldi came to make the music for Charlie Brown and Peanuts</h2>
<p>By the mid-60s, Charles M. Schulz’s Peanuts comic strip, which began in 1950, had become a national phenomenon. The strip broke new ground with its subject matter – it was politically, philosophically, and sociologically attuned in a way that influences comics to this day – and Schulz won numerous awards from his peers. In 1965, he was on the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine, a unique honor for a cartoonist.</p>
<p>Around this time, Peabody Award-winning producer Lee Mendelson was working on a follow up to his widely acclaimed documentary <em>A Man Named Wille Mays</em>, and he turned his focus to Schulz and Peanuts as both men were based in northern California. While the documentary was in the planning stages, Mendelson heard Guaraldi’s “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” on KSFO as he was driving across the Golden Gate Bridge and had an aha moment. “It was melodic and open like a breeze off the bay.” Mendelson was friends with famed jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason who put him in touch with the pianist.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that Guaraldi’s Grammy-winning tune became the template for much of the music in Peanuts, especially, “Linus and Lucy.” “Many details are imitated exactly,” wrote pianist Ethan Iverson in <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/deck-the-halls-with-vince-guaraldi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong></a>, “The main argument of ‘Fate’ is a strong, syncopated, even eighth-note melody harmonized in diatonic triads floating over a left-hand bagpipe and bowed bass, followed by an answering call of gospel chords embellished by rumbles in the left hand borrowed from Horace Silver. This general scheme is followed for ‘Linus and Lucy,’ even down to the same key, A-flat.” Iverson goes on to praise Guaraldi’s arrangements, a marriage of European inspired horn fifths and African influenced rhythms. The music is so innovative that it doesn’t seem awkward that the characters dance slightly off the beat. Instead, it feels like a modern touch.</p>
<p>The documentary was shelved, but a partnership developed, and with Guaraldi on board for the music, a new project emerged: a holiday television show, “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” which proved to be a big hit. It won an Emmy and a Peabody and became an annual event. Guaraldi didn’t just create the stellar music for the show, but the garbled adult voices were his doing too. He adapted sounds from a trombone to create the effect. The success of the show led to a whopping 45 other animated shows, several movies, and numerous other adaptations, each with supremely innovative and accessible music by Guaraldi. Some, like “The Great Pumpkin Waltz” from “It’s the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown,” has “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” as a template.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cP8ZfRZCy1c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h2>The influence of the Peanuts soundtracks</h2>
<p>The success of the Peanuts television shows couldn’t have come at a better time for Guaraldi. The jazz economy was in a deep recession in the late 60s, but Guaraldi stayed busy. Sadly, he didn’t have long to enjoy the success. In 1976, the evening after finishing the music for “It’s Arbor Day Charlie Brown,” Guaraldi was in between sets at a Butterfield’s Nightclub in Menlo Park, California when he suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 47.</p>
<p>The influence of his music is eternal. Leading pianists like George Winston and David Benoit have devoted entire albums to Guaraldi’s music. And it’s not hard to hear echoes of Guaraldi in giants like <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/keith-jarrett/"><strong>Keith Jarrett</strong></a>, Gary Burton, and Pat Metheny. On the YouTube series, <em>Play Piano in a Flash</em>, Benoit said, “He had such a great melodic sense; he was one of the grandfathers of the contemporary smooth jazz movement.”</p>
<p>The lasting impact of Guaraldi’s innovations goes well beyond the music world. In the Netflix documentary, <em>Becoming</em>, former First Lady Michelle Obama is giving a tour of her childhood home, and when she comes to the piano room, she pauses for a moment then sits down and plays the first minute or so of “Linus and Lucy.” She pauses again upon lifting her hands from the keyboard and says to no one in particular, “right?”</p>
<p>Music fans everywhere likely smiled and nodded.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Guru had the voice. Resonant and captivating, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/gang-starr">Gang Starr</a></strong>’s late frontman possessed an unmistakable monotone. The lack of modulation lent gravity to every word, made him sound both serious and mellow. Like a monk, his chill was impregnable. Secure in his knowledge of self, he wanted to impart his hard-earned wisdom to the next generation. Black people were royalty and revolutionaries in his verses, to be respected in body and mind even if society and the government violated one and poisoned the other. The combination of Guru’s voice and subject matter made him sound as though he was holding court on the corner. On Gang Starr's best songs, he was not preachy or pedantic. He just didn’t suffer fools, disrespect, or fake MC’s with bodyguards. Even when he addressed his frustrations, he aimed to uplift.</p>
<p>Guru’s voice and lyrics were only half of the equation. <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/genre/dj-premier/"><strong>DJ</strong> <strong>Premier</strong></a> provided the score to Guru’s narratives, his beats groundbreaking collages of soul, jazz, funk, and more all sourced from the deepest crates. He alchemized fragments to create a universe that brought you to ground level in New York and levitated above it. The drums slammed like subway doors, and the samples oscillated between gritty and regal. Premier punctuated his beats with scratching so fluid, precise, and in-sync you sometimes questioned whether he was doing it at all.</p>

<p>Together, Guru and Premier were the platonic ideal of the rap duo, taking the foundational DJ-rapper template and elevating their unique formula for new eras. Primo’s range expanded with every album, from the quasi demo that was 1989’s <em>No More Mr. Nice Guy</em> to 2003’s <em>The Ownerz</em>. Guru’s voice always cut through, his lyrics becoming wiser each outing. Though Gang Starr never went platinum, the gems on the three-album run that was <em>Daily Operation</em> (1992), <em>Hard to Earn</em> (1994), and <em>Moment of Truth</em> (1998) weigh more than any number of plaques.</p>
<p>The duo split after <em>The Ownerz</em>, but Guru passed away before they were able to reconnect. Still, Guru and Premier’s synergy was so strong that death couldn’t erode it. Premier pieced together new Gang Starr songs with unreleased Guru vocals for 2019’s <em>One of the Best Yet</em>. Once again, the rapper from Boston and the producer/DJ from Texas, reminded the world of how they shaped the sound of rap in New York and around the world.</p>

<h2>The Hits</h2>
<h3>(“Mass Appeal”, “Skills”, “DWYCK”, “Full Clip”, “You Know My Steez”)</h3>
<p>Gang Starr never topped the charts. They were always more of an album group, one whose records required careful listening to understand every verse and identify every sample. Ironically, their highest charting single was a diss to rappers who compromised their art for profit. “Mass Appeal” peaked at #67… “All this watered down stuff is dominating the airwaves,” <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/dj-premier-my-life-in-15-songs-630261/gang-starr-mass-appeal-1994-627640/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Premier told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>. “We should make a record to make fun of that…” Premier freaked a few bars from a Vic Juris record and created a mesmerizing melody that complemented Guru’s voice. Guru also waxed poetic about his rap proficiency, a trope he parlayed for other charting singles. “Skills” and “You Know My Steez” are two sides of the same coin, the former a booming and bombastic track and the latter a laid-back affair. Here and on “Full Clip,” which dropped a year later, he raps about blessing “every mic he touches.”</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TgelVkHEKdw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>“DWYCK” is another avowal of mic supremacy, but the tone is more playful than much of Gang Starr’s catalog. Guru, who usually wrote everything down, freestyled his entire verse. He chants “eenie meenie miney moe” and opines about the enduring popularity of lemonade before comparing himself to Langston Hughes. The hilarious and eloquent features from Greg Nice and Smooth B endure today, as Run the Jewels used one of Nice’s lyrics for the hook on 2020’s “Ooh La La.”</p>
<h2>Moments of Truth</h2>
<h3>(“Just to Get a Rep”, “Conspiracy”, “Code of the Streets”, “Above the Clouds”, “Royalty”, “JFK2LAX”, “Moment of Truth”)</h3>
<p>Rap began as party music, but it quickly became focused on exposing the capital-T Truth. Gang Starr prided themselves on remaining true to rap traditions while combating all falsehoods. “Just to Get a Rep” and “Code of the Streets” illustrated the grim realities of life in economically neglected neighborhoods. 1992’s “Conspiracy” brilliantly examined the many ways systemic racism has had often fatal consequences for black people “in a world dominated by whiteness.” In concise and sharp lines, Guru points out the racial bias of standardized tests and their relation to the school-to-prison pipeline as well as the media’s attempts to paint black people as violent.</p>
<p>He countered the media’s racist narratives with songs like “Royalty,” where he reminds black men and women of their royal lineage and reaffirms their inherent worth as human beings. Elsewhere, like on “Moment of Truth,” Guru wrestled with existential questions facing “everybody everywhere” (e.g., “Why do bad things happen to good people?”).</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/urpqxl2HfLg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h2>Love and Loss</h2>
<h3>(“Lovesick”, “Ex-Girl to Next Girl”, “She Knows What She Wantz”)</h3>
<p>Guru was more sensitive than his voice would suggest. Most Gang Starr albums feature at least one song devoted to the nuances and complexities of romantic relationships. <em>Step in the Arena</em>’s “Lovesick” is an honest and empathetic chronicle of a relationship turned sour as Guru attempts to allay his girlfriend’s jealous fears. “Ex-Girl to Next Girl” almost plays out like a sequel. Over thumping drums and a downtempo funk, Guru realizes the jealousy and fighting were manipulative, that his ex shook his confidence so she could shake him down for every dollar. By the end, he’s moved on. “She Knows What She Wantz” from 1998’s <em>Moment of Truth</em>, however, is a thorough analysis of the money-driven, status-obsessed women Guru left on “Ex-Girl to Next Girl.” With each year and album, Guru became more clear-headed, better at protecting his heart and pockets.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B8kW6IEBdf0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h2>Take It Personal</h2>
<h3>(“Take a Rest”, “Step in the Arena”, “Work”, “Take It Personal”, “Family &amp; Loyalty”)</h3>
<p>Battling your opponents—real or imagined—is a foundational tenet of hip-hop. Guru and Premier applied the pressure often. <em>Step in the Arena</em> wasn’t their first salvo, but it features some of their most damaging records. “Step in the Arena” and “Take a Rest” are banging, post-<strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/public-enemy/">Bomb Squad</a></strong> productions from Premier that find Guru scrolling through the “Wack Rappers Almanac” and admonishing hordes of “true zero[es].”</p>
<p>Guru continued to aim at every possible target throughout his career, becoming even colder towards the opposition. You can hear how he refined his approach and found new conceits for his disses on “Work.” Here he likens his lyrics and movements in the rap industry to a mob boss plotting on rival crews, laying low until the opportune time to deliver a diss or sign a contract. Guru isn’t even content with destroying his competition once. He wants his verbal “onslaught” to be so detrimental that it crushes their dreams of rapping forever.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLIoldHh53Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>On the best Gang Starr tracks, you were as liable to get roasted for disrespecting the mic as you were disrespecting your peers. “Take it Personal,” from 1992’s <em>Daily Operation</em>, is a declaration of retribution against snakes who’ve wronged the group either personally or professionally. Over skull-cracking drums and dark keys, Guru vows to take revenge in the real world and enact it on record. With “Family and Loyalty,” the first single from the posthumous Guru record <em>One of the Best Yet</em>, they (and J. Cole) compare the titular realities to diamonds, precious commodities that should be “forever” coveted. Rap songs “like C.R.E.A.M. or My Melody” receive the same comparison. It’s a testament to Guru’s respect for (some of) his peers, those he considered loyal to rap and thus family.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Life on the road, with all its perils and temptations, coupled with a tendency among some young people to both “push the envelope” and believe they are indestructible, has meant that we have lost too many musicians at a tragically early age. But it is jazz musicians who have perhaps suffered the most… especially during jazz’s heyday during the 40s and 50s.</p>
<p>For all gifted jazz musicians, lingering self-doubt and often driven personalities have played with the mind, meaning that many have dabbled in drugs – only to become hooked. Some managed to deal with their addictions, notably <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/miles-davis"><strong>Miles Davis</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/herbie-hancock">Herbie Hancock</a>,</strong> and Sonny Rollins. Others managed to kick hard drugs but replaced them with booze, which played an equally destructive part in their lives.</p>
<p>Having been addicts, their weakened bodies were sometimes attacked by pneumonia and tuberculosis. Antibiotics to treat such illnesses were not readily available, and traveling together in close proximity did nothing to curtail the spread of communicable diseases.</p>
<p>Then again, other jazz musicians were plain unlucky: car and train accidents figure in the early deaths of some prominent jazz musicians. Trumpeter Woody Shaw was one such victim. By the late 80s he was suffering from an incurable degenerative eye disease when, in February 1989, he was hit by a subway train in Brooklyn, New York, which severed his left arm; after suffering complications in the hospital, he died of kidney failure on May 10, 1989, at just 44 years old.</p>
<h2>Clifford Brown</h2>
<p>Another jazz trumpeter suffered a similar fate, robbing the world of his promise. Clifford Brown received the New Star award in the 1956 <em>Down Beat</em> critics’ poll. Six years earlier, after attending Maryland State University, Brown had been in a serious car accident that delayed his recording debut until 1952. Four years later, just hours before his death, Brown had been playing at a Philadelphia record store and the jam was recorded; it featured some of the best music he ever played. The man they called Brownie, who was already being placed in the same league as Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis, died aged just 25, in a car accident en route from Philadelphia to Chicago. Also killed in the crash was the young pianist Richie Powell, brother of Bud, and Richie’s wife, who was driving. One of jazz’s great hopes turned into one of jazz’s great what-might-have-beens.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmNBXvbC2cU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Brown was a major influence on Donald Byrd, Freddie Hubbard, and Wynton Marsalis, among others. According to Sonny Rollins, who was recovering from a heroin addiction, “Clifford was a profound influence on my personal life. He showed me that it was possible to live a good, clean life and still be a good jazz musician.”</p>
<h2>Lee Morgan</h2>
<p>Edward Lee Morgan was 33 years old when he died in very different circumstances. Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, he became a hard bop trumpeter and joined the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band at 18. Morgan was one of those artists who transcended musical genres, and, in 1956, he began his prolific recording stint with Blue Note, releasing 25 albums and working with almost every musician of note that appeared on the label.</p>
<p>In February 1972, at a Manhattan club called Slug’s, Morgan was shot by his wife as he came off stage. He had been battling heroin addiction but was almost out of rehab when Helen More-Morgan accidentally killed him after an altercation regarding his usage and affairs; stuck in a snowstorm, the ambulance was late in arriving at the club, a delay which caused Morgan to bleed to death. It was a sad and tawdry demise for an artist who had enormous problems in his lifetime but countered his demons with some superb albums.</p>

<h2>Fats Navarro</h2>
<p>Fats Navarro was considered Dizzy’s main rival, as superbly demonstrated on the <em>Fats Navarro Memorial Album</em>, issued shortly after his death. Navarro, born in Key West, Florida, and of Cuban-Black-Chinese parentage, was a major influence on Clifford Brown and many others that followed him, but he died aged just 26.</p>
<p>Navarro was a heroin addict and he developed both tuberculosis and a weight problem, both of which contributed to his slow decline. Following a gig at Birdland with <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/charlie-parker"><strong>Charlie Parker</strong></a>, Navarro was hospitalized on July 1, 1950, and, before the week was out, he was dead.</p>
<h2>Bix Beiderbecke</h2>
<p>The Mississippi riverboat that the 20-year-old <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/louis-armstrong"><strong>Louis Armstrong</strong></a> worked on cruised up and down the mighty river, and one day in 1921 he met a 17-year-old white guy with pretensions to play hot trumpet. Bix Beiderbecke, from a well-off family of German immigrants, lived in Davenport, Iowa, and introduced himself to Louis. The two became friendly, and Bix, who had taught himself to play by listening to records, admired Louis’ playing style, adapting what he heard into a unique fusion of trumpet-playing that combined innovative improvisation with a pure, clear tone.</p>
<p>Ten years later, Beiderbecke was dead aged just 28, in part the victim of his own alcoholism and the effects of this on his overall health. He did so much to bring jazz to white audiences, but his death in his apartment in Queens, New York, was a horrible one: tormented by demons inspired by drink, Beiderbecke’s official case of death was given as lobar pneumonia.</p>
<h2>Charlie Christian</h2>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/features/musical-pioneers-you-should-know"><strong>early jazz pioneer</strong></a> who succumbed to tuberculosis was the brilliant guitarist Charlie Christian. Born in Bonham, Texas, he took the electric guitar from the staccato rhythm swing style of Freddie Green to the more modern bebop and cool jazz sounds that were then taken up by Oscar Moore, Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel, and Herb Ellis. Christian was not an addict, but life on the road with Benny Goodman’s band took its toll on the guitarist, who had contracted tuberculosis in the late 30s. He had a protracted stay in a sanatorium on Staten Island and, initially, it appeared he was getting better, but he died in March 1942, aged just 25.</p>
<h2>Fats Waller</h2>
<p>Thomas Wright Waller – The King Of The Harlem Stride Pianists – was born the son of a preacher man in New York City, and his first musical experiences were playing the harmonium for his father’s sermons. While his piano-playing become an inspiration to many, it was not until the man more commonly known as “Fats” began singing, in 1930, that he found real fame. In 1932, Waller joined radio station WLW in Cincinnati, where he broadcast the “Fats” Waller Rhythm Club. It was in 1934, at a party given by composer George Gershwin, that Fats got his biggest break. He entertained the party with his singing, playing, and clowning around, and a Victor Records executive offered Fats a lucrative recording contract. Virtually every one of his piano-playing contemporaries, and those that followed, owed something to Fats’ style. In all he made over 500 recordings and wrote 400 songs, often recording as many as ten sides in a day.</p>
<p>In 1935, Waller made his movie debut in <em>Hooray For Love</em>, and in 1943, the year of his death, he co-starred in <em>Stormy Weather</em> with Lena Horne and Cab Calloway. Fats was a renowned drinker and it was this that contributed to his death, aged just 39, in December 1943, from pneumonia on board a train at Union Station, Kansas City.</p>
<h2>Nat King Cole</h2>
<p>As Fats’ life was coming to an end another, very different, pianist’s career was just getting underway. <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/nat-king-cole"><strong>Nat King Cole</strong></a> began performing in the mid-30s, while still a teenager, and his first hit was “Straighten Up and Fly Right,” which sold over 500,000 copies for Capitol Records in 1943. It was as a singer that Nat Cole captivated so many, and this sometimes means that people overlook what a brilliant jazz pianist he was.</p>
<p>Cole believed that cigarettes gave his voice the rich timbre that fans were so enamored with, which meant that he remained a heavy smoker throughout his life. Almost inevitably, he died of lung cancer, in February 1965, shortly after an operation to remove his left lung.</p>
<h2>Chick Webb</h2>
<p>Drummers generally lived longer lives than their musical contemporaries, but not so the tragic figure of Chick Webb. When 18-year-old <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/ella-fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a></strong> landed a job as the singer with Chick Webb And His Orchestra, in 1935, the drummer was already a sick man.</p>
<p>Webb had contracted tuberculosis of the spine while he was a child, leaving him both extremely short as well as suffering from a badly deformed spine. He was born in Maryland, but moved to Harlem in his teens and, by 21, he was leading his own band. Given his physical difficulties, it’s perhaps surprising that Webb managed to become a drummer – and a very good one at that. He drew admiration from many other bandleaders: Buddy Rich spoke of Webb as an inspiration, and Charlie Watts of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-rolling-stones"><strong>The Rolling Stones</strong></a> is a big fan. By June 1939, Ella had recorded a string of successful records with Webb’s orchestra, but he died in Baltimore at the age of 34.</p>
<h2>Eric Dolphy</h2>
<p>There are a number of jazz saxophonists that have been taken too soon, including the great Eric Dolphy, who was just 36 years old when he died in Berlin, Germany, while on tour, shortly after recording his seminal album <em>Out To Lunch</em>. Just before he went on tour in the early summer of 1964, Dolphy said, “I’m on my way to Europe to live for a while. Why? Because I can get more work there playing my own music and because if you try to do anything different in this country, people put you down for it.” <em>Out To Lunch</em> was the one Blue Note album he recorded as a leader, and it is a fitting epitaph to the man who died, in late June 1964, from an undiagnosed diabetic condition.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzBpK1GcwdQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<h2>Charlie Parker</h2>
<p>Charlie Parker Jr, the man nicknamed “Bird” was one of the most important figures in the development of jazz and was two years younger than Dolphy when he died of lobar pneumonia. Parker hailed from the jazz well that was Kansas City, and, by 1940, he’d joined pianist Jay McShann’s Band, writing arrangements as well as leading the sax section.</p>
<p>By 1945, the Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie band was breaking the rules and tearing up the jazz script, but it was at a cost: in June 1946, while performing in Los Angeles, Parker suffered a nervous breakdown and was committed to a mental hospital.</p>
<p>By February 1947, Bird was out and back in the studio sounding better than ever, and after he finished in Los Angeles he went back to New York. Here he formed a new quartet with Miles Davis, Duke Jordan, Tommy Potter, and Max Roach, recording more great sides in the autumn of 1947, and his live appearances included a concert at Carnegie Hall with Dizzy.</p>
<p>In 1950, he released the outstanding album <em>Charlie Parker With Strings</em>, but by ’51 Parker was arrested for heroin possession and had his cabaret card revoked. The following year, when he got his card back, club owners were reluctant to book him – a situation that got so bad he was even banned from Birdland. By September 1954, Bird had a breakdown, even attempting suicide. After another spell in hospital, he got back on his feet and was booked to appear at Birdland in March 1955, but before he could fulfil his engagement Parker died at the home of jazz patron, Baroness Pannonica De Koenigswarter.</p>
<p>Bird was 34 when he died, but according to the autopsy report, he had the body of a man of over 50. Lived fast, died young? Definitely. But along the way, he helped make modern jazz sound the way it does today.</p>
<h2>John Coltrane</h2>
<p>The other giant of jazz saxophone in the 50s and 60s was, of course, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/john-coltrane"><strong>John Coltrane</strong></a>. Following a short-term serving in the US Navy, Coltrane worked with a series of bandleaders, including Eddie Vinson (1947-48), Dizzy Gillespie (1949-1951), and Earl Bostic (1952–1953). His first proper recording session was with drummer Teddy Stewart’s Orchestra – made up mostly of Dizzy’s band members – backing <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/dinah-washington"><strong>Dinah Washington</strong></a> on some singles for Mercury.</p>
<p>From 1953, Coltrane focused on tenor saxophone, playing with Johnny Hodges. In 1955, Coltrane secured the gig that brought him to a wider audience, playing in Miles Davis’ new quintet, with Red Garland, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones.</p>
<p>Coltrane cited 1957 as the year of his spiritual awakening, when he rid himself of heroin and alcohol addictions; he was shocked into change after being sacked from Miles Davis’ Quintet. Coltrane had previously been fired by Gillespie for his escalating drug use, and this time losing such a great gig and experiencing a near overdose was the wake-up call he needed. After some tough times straightening himself out, Coltrane soon returned to play the second half of 1957 with Thelonious Monk’s Quartet, before once again joining Davis at the beginning of 1958.</p>
<p>To catalog Coltrane’s recording during the next decade is to list some of the greatest jazz records ever made. While he was clean, ’Trane still had one vice: overeating. Food became a comfort for him to assuage the rigors of constantly performing. Legend also has it that the saxophonist ate so many mint humbugs that his saxophone keys clogged up with sugar.</p>
<p>However, Coltrane wasn’t entirely finished with mind-altering substances, and his look to the East for spiritual meaning was partly fuelled by his increasing use of LSD. In July 1967, Coltrane died, aged 40, from cancer of the liver. When asked how he would like to be remembered, he replied, “As a saint.”</p>
<h2>Billie Holiday</h2>
<p>And then there’s <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/billie-holiday/">Billie Holiday</a></strong>. Lady Day – the name bestowed upon her by saxophonist Lester Young – was a brilliant singer and a great lyrical interpreter, lived life hard, and may well have been the greatest jazz singer of all time.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lx_mOECjT_8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Abused as a child, she had a spell in a Catholic children’s home before cleaning and running errands for a brothel madam. By 1928, Billie’s mother moved to Harlem with her daughter, and before long they were both working in a brothel; 14-year-old Billie was charged with vagrancy and sent to a workhouse.</p>
<p>In October 1933, aged 18, she was heard singing in a Harlem club by John Hammond, a music critic and record producer, who had her record a couple of sides with Benny Goodman. The following year, Hammond coerced Brunswick Records into recording Holiday with Teddy Wilson And His Orchestra – the first of close to 100 recordings Billie made with the pianist.</p>
<p>Before the end of the decade, Billie sang with the Count Basie Orchestra, and with Artie Shaw, becoming one of the first black singers to appear with a white orchestra. She later appeared at Café Society in Greenwich Village, which leads to her recording one of the most important songs of her career – and, indeed, of any singer’s – “Strange Fruit.” The anti-lynching protest poem set to music stunned audiences into silence when she sang it live – both men and women wept.</p>
<p>While Holiday’s career was moving in the right direction, her personal life was not. She married Jimmy Monroe, best described as a hustler who was busted for smuggling marijuana, which Billie had been smoking for years. Sadly, he also brought opium into her life and, by 1944, she was using heroin.</p>
<p>Billie’s drug problems came to the fore when she was arrested in Philadelphia in May 1947 and charged with possession of heroin, for which she received a one-year sentence. When Billie was released, she had kicked her habit and looked better than she had done in years. However, Monroe wasted no time in getting Billie back into her old habits. She was arrested again, but this time she was acquitted.</p>
<p>Throughout the early 50s, Holiday recorded for Norman Granz’s Clef and Norgran labels, but, despite remarrying in 1957, she was still taking drugs. Once her marriage ended, her drug habit, fortified by excessive drinking, turned Holiday into a pale shadow of herself. When Lester Young – probably her one true friend throughout her life – died in March 1959, it was a hammer blow. Two months later, Billie was hospitalized from her drug use. She was refused entry to one hospital because she took drugs, and at a second one, where a nurse found drugs at her bedside, she was arrested. Billie died just over a month later, on July 17, 1959, in New York City, still in hospital, still under arrest.</p>
<p>In so many ways, Holiday’s life encapsulates the trials and tribulations of jazz musicians during this period when some of the greatest music we call jazz was made.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>At first listen, Tame Impala’s <em>Currents</em> sounds like a light and breezy album. It’s is filled with nostalgia-inducing synths evocative of hazy summer mornings and listless afternoons. But if there’s a bittersweet aftertaste, it’s because those hazy synths obscure Kevin Parker’s melancholy lyrics.</p>
<p>More than anything, <em>Currents</em> is an album defined by a sense of longing: for change, for a sense of identity, and for a new beginning. It’s a classic album that intertwines nostalgia and doubt to encapsulate just how confusing the quest for a fresh start can be.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://udiscover.lnk.to/Tame-Impala-Currents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen to <em>Currents</em> right now</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Released on July 17, 2015, <em>Currents</em> marked a departure from the more traditional psych-rock that made up Tame Impala’s first two albums. It was a DIY endeavor in the truest sense, in that it found Parker writing, producing, performing, recording, and mixing the album all while holed up in his home studio in Perth, Australia. Those efforts clearly paid off, with <em>Currents</em> becoming his band’s highest-charting release, earning a Grammy nomination, and refashioning Parker as a master of pop.</p>
<h2>Balancing hope and doubt</h2>
<p>Beyond its ever-evolving landscape of synths and dance-worthy drums, <em>Currents</em> is about balancing moments of hope and doubt. An instant that feels warm and fuzzy can just as immediately feel panic-inducing. “The Moment” is just one of the many pleasant sounding songs on the album that, when you really listen, hides darker layers, unfolding into contemplations on the overwhelming anxiety that you might never be ready for what’s coming next.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFptt7Cargc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>The 24-hour news cycle has evolved into a constant social-media circuit, now more self-perpetuating than ever before. Even if you want to break free, it’s hard to even separate yourself from it. On “Reality In Motion,” Parker feels like his heart is in overdrive, running in circles. Time seems to move so fast that you don’t even have time to gauge the severity and the impact of everything happening around you. And that leads to a sense of dread – that everything could come crashing down around you despite your best attempts to escape.</p>
<p>Because modern life is operating at such breakneck speed, it’s hard to know which way is up. “Past Life” describes just how hard it can be to gauge change; the person you were just a few years ago feels like someone you don’t know at all. Change is so constant that it’s hard to even trust your old self as a constant variable.</p>
<h2>More culturally apt than ever</h2>
<p>Throughout the album, Parker’s synths sound like they’re underwater, sometimes static and garbled. That can make the instrumentation sound inviting, but as a reflection of Parker’s emotion, it can feel like drowning. What sounds like dance music is actually reflective meditation, and that’s more culturally apt than ever.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBzrzS1Ag_g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>Throughout <em>Currents</em>, Parker is waiting for the unidentifiable moments that can overpower. His fixation on the past prevents him from being as free as he’d like to be in the present. Combined with this doomed anticipation, it feels like he may never manage to find the release he seeks. And yet he eventually does find it “Yes I’m Changing.” “They say people never change, but that’s bullsh__t, they do/Yes I’m changing, can’t stop it now,” he sings.</p>
<p>On “The Less I Know the Better,” Parker describes a less-than-perfect relationship to suggest that everyone’s happier when they’re ignorant – and maybe that’s true. The world’s collective inability to be content is part and parcel of constant cultural overstimulation. And that can feel hopeless! But <em>Currents</em> certainly isn’t hopeless – just uncertain. The desire to change and evolve despite not knowing where it will lead you is not only the driving force of the record, but a universal theme that continues to speak to audiences today. Change might be unattainable – but it could also be just around the corner.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>As the snappy drumbeats and bouncy guitar riffs of “Our Lips Are Sealed” open <em>Beauty and the Beat</em>, you can’t help but tap your feet. It’s new wave at its best: pop with just enough edge and plenty of hooks. And when the album was released in July 1981, it was also the world’s introduction to five of the coolest women in music: The Go-Go’s. With unforgettable tracks like “We Got The Beat,” “This Town” and “Our Lips Are Sealed,” <em>Beauty and the Beat</em> established The Go-Go’s as one of the hottest new bands of the decade. Not only did it hit No.1 on the <em>Billboard</em> 200, it stood as the second best-selling album of the year, and one of the highest-selling debut albums of all time.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to <em>Beauty and the Beat</em> on <a href="http://udiscover.lnk.to/The-Go-Gos-Beauty-And-The-Beat/applemusic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple Music</a> and <a href="http://udiscover.lnk.to/The-Go-Gos-Beauty-And-The-Beat/spotify" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Punk beginnings</h2>
<p>Despite the record’s radio-friendly, cheerful melodies, The Go-Go’s were actually a product of Los Angeles’ burgeoning <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/punk-to-grunge/"><strong>punk rock</strong> </a>scene. Playing under the pseudonym of Dottie Danger, frontwoman Belinda Carlisle began her musical career in the late 70s as a drummer for the LA band Germs (her bandmate Pat Smear went on to join <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/nirvana/"><strong>Nirvana</strong></a> and, later, Foo Fighters). Guitarist Charlotte Caffey played bass in local band The Eyes, while rhythm guitarist Jane Wiedlin was a mainstay of the scene and an in-demand underground clothing designer. The three women, along with original Go-Go’s Elissa Bello and Margot Olavarria, met and bonded at shows – eventually deciding to form a band of their own.</p>
<p>With regular gigs at venues like Hollywood’s <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/whisky-a-go-go-when-la-rock-ruled-the-strip/"><strong>Whisky A Go Go</strong></a> and The Masque, The Go-Go’s quickly built a following. Soon, they were offered a support slot with Madness on tour in the UK, and it was there that the group recorded their very first single, “We Got The Beat”/“How Much More,” on British indie label Stiff Records.</p>
<p>By the turn of the 80s, drummer Gina Schock and bassist Kathy Valentine had replaced Bello and Olavarria, solidifying The Go-Go’s classic line-up. The band’s sound had evolved, too, moving away from punk rock towards the emerging, pop-forward <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/brand-new-wave/"><strong>new wave</strong></a> genre.</p>
<p>In April 1981, the quintet signed with IRS Records, home to some of the biggest alternative, new wave, and college rock acts of the decade, including The Bangles, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/r-e-m/"><strong>R.E.M.</strong></a>, Dead Kennedys, and The Stranglers, among others. The Go-Go’s soon headed to New York to record their debut album with producers Rob Freeman (<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/blondie/"><strong>Blondie</strong></a>, Ramones, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/kiss/"><strong>KISS</strong></a>) and Richard Gottehrer (Richard Hell, Joan Armatrading, The Fleshtones).</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f55KlPe81Yw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<h2>A pop-cultural touchstone</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the infectious “We Got The Beat” was released in the UK. Throughout the summer, the high-energy track picked up steam in Europe’s dance clubs, making its way to DJs across the Atlantic, where it peaked at No.35 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot Dance Club Play chart. Though the IRS version of the song, re-recorded for <em>Beauty and the Beat</em>, wouldn’t officially be released in the US until January 1982 (and with a different B-side, “Can’t Stop The World”), it still packed a punch, spending three weeks at No.2 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 and becoming The Go-Go’s’ biggest hit. The track also played during the opening credits of the 1982 cult classic <em>Fast Times At Ridgemont High</em>, officially cementing the song as a touchstone of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/80s-music/"><strong>80s pop culture</strong></a>.</p>
<p><em>Beauty and the Beat</em>’s lead single, however, was the sassy yet wistful “Our Lips Are Sealed.” Released in June 1981, the song was inspired by a letter that Jane Wiedlin received from The Specials’ frontman, Terry Hall. The two had an affair while The Go-Go’s were on their first UK tour, but their brief relationship wasn’t for naught. Hall’s words were borrowed throughout the track – so much so that he was credited as a co-writer.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3kQlzOi27M?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Though “Our Lips Are Sealed” only peaked at No.20 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100, it also landed on the Dance and Rock Tracks chart, ultimately remaining on the US charts for over 30 weeks – which is highly unusual for the lifespan of a single. The song did better in Canada and Australia, though, peaking at No.3 and No.2, respectively.</p>
<h2>The embodiment of cool, carefree LA</h2>
<p>The colorful, accompanying music video for “Our Lips Are Sealed” followed the band in a 60s convertible, driving around Beverly Hills and splashing about in the city’s famous Electric Fountain. To teens around the world, The Go-Go’s were the embodiment of a cool, carefree LA lifestyle.</p>
<p>Another highlight on the album is the tongue-in-cheek ode to Los Angeles, “This Town.” In layered harmonies, the women taunt, “This town is our town/(This town) It is so glamorous/Bet you’d live here if you could/And be one of us.” Then they expose the reality of their city in the last verse: “Change the lines that were said before/We’re all dreamers – we’re all whores/Discarded stars/Like worn out cars/Litter the streets of this town.”</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ahjzHZHMks?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Elsewhere on the album, influences of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/the-power-of-girl-groups/"><strong>60s-era girl-group</strong> </a>balladry can be heard in songs like “Fading Fast,” while rougher, faster tracks like “How Much More’,” “You Can’t Walk In Your Sleep (If You Can’t Sleep),” and “Skidmarks On My Heart” reveal the band’s punk rock roots, bringing to mind many of their contemporaries, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-jam/"><strong>The Jam</strong></a> and The Clash among them.</p>
<h2>Breaking gender barriers</h2>
<p>Following its release, <em>Beauty and the Beat</em> earned The Go-Go’s their first Grammy nomination – for Best New Artist – and left fans eager for more, as evidenced by their sophomore bestseller, 1982’s <em>Vacation</em>. While the band would go their separate ways by the middle of the decade (with multiple reunions to follow throughout the 90s and beyond), <em>Beauty and the Beat</em> remains a foundational new wave record. The album also broke gender barriers, establishing The Go-Go’s the only all-female act to wholly write and record a No.1 album on the <em>Billboard</em> 200.</p>
<p>Decades after its release, <em>Beauty and the Beat</em> still feels fresh, urgent and… just plain cool. At first glance, the band could easily have been brushed off as a manufactured pop act, but that couldn’t have been further from the truth. Though their music was played on Top 40 radio, The Go-Go’s weren’t anything like the polished, pop acts of the era. Instead, they offered something else – true musicianship, sharp-witted lyricism, and a unique, defiant sound. Embodying the independent spirit of the social misfit, The Go-Go’s were, perhaps, the original purveyors of “girl power”, offering teenagers around the country something to relate – and, ultimately, aspire – to.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>If ever there was an anthem that took the experience of the Jamaican poor to the world, it was "No Woman, No Cry." There had been earlier pop hits that related the struggles of Jamaican ghetto dwellers, notably Desmond Dekker’s "Israelites" in 1968, but most listeners who heard Dekker’s record would not have understood his message, and it was delivered in such bright tones that few would have suspected it was serious. But you couldn’t mistake <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/bob-marley/"><strong>Bob Marley</strong></a>’s intent on "No Woman, No Cry." This deeply spiritual song spoke volumes about life in the Trenchtown ghetto without saying a single explicit word about how poor the people were or about injustice. Instead, it offers memories, observations, and, above all, solace and hope. It is pure Bob Marley: warm-hearted and spiritual.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IT8XvzIfi4U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<h2>A celebration of life in the face of hardship</h2>
<p>"No Woman, No Cry" first appeared on <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/bob-marley-natty-dread/"><em><strong>Natty Dread</strong> </em></a>in 1974, riding a drum machine rhythm, an innovation in reggae courtesy of The Wailers’ bass player, Aston “Family Man” Barrett. The memorable keyboard arrangement was provided by session player Jean Roussel, a pivotal part of the song that became even more glowing under the brilliant fingers of Hammond player Tyrone Downie when the song was delivered at the Lyceum Ballroom, London, on July 18, 1975, where it was captured for posterity on the <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/bob-marley-live/"><em><strong>Live!</strong></em></a> album.</p>
<p>Those who only know the latter cut, which became Bob’s breakthrough pop hit, are often surprised by how thin and gentle the studio version sounds, with the drum machine ticking away, the almost funky guitar with a hint of wah-wah, and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-i-threes-bob-marleys-reggae-singers/"><strong>The I-Threes</strong></a> joining in like it was a jam or a rehearsal. It’s barely reggae at all in terms of rhythm, which suggests it’s just this great Jamaican band working through the song in a relaxed way, not trying to lay down some deep rhythm. This is clever production by Chris Blackwell, The Wailers, and Bob; it emphasizes the down-home feel of the song like they really are sitting in the Government Yard in Trenchtown, chatting, making music, and recalling the past.</p>
<p>One of the advantages Bob had over most reggae artists was the fact that he worked with a regular band and was touring. Most Jamaican singers didn’t keep their own band and played gigs here and there with whoever was competent and available. Hence Bob’s songs developed a life of their own through repeated playing with The Wailers. Within nine months of <em>Natty Dread</em>’s release, "No Woman, No Cry" had grown big, bold, and magnificent. It now had room to breathe: the original had been three minutes and 46 seconds long; the one presented on <em>Live!</em> extended to more than seven minutes (it was chopped back to around the length of the studio version for release on 7” single). This modestly delivered though inspirational song had become a swaying, swelling, soulful skank, with angelic opening singing from The I-Threes, a heavyweight one-drop from Carlton Barrett on drums, and a celebratory atmosphere. We had hard times but there was love and friendship and hope; some of us were lost, they are remembered. Some survived and thrived. It’s a glorious celebration of life in the face of hardship. Don’t cry: we must live on.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2JZetjkhdYQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<h2>An anthem for all times</h2>
<p>There were debates about who had written the song, even unsuccessful lawsuits from Bob’s former publisher. It had been credited to Vincent Ford, a well-known character around Trenchtown when Bob was growing up. A paraplegic, Ford lost his legs when young, owing to untreated diabetes – medical treatment was in short supply in the ghetto – and rolled around Trench in a wheelchair. Undeterred, he ran a soup kitchen in an area known as the Government Yards. Rather than being one specific open space, the Yards both referred to home in Jamaican English and the open spaces between buildings erected in a 40s government scheme to house the poor in Western Kingston. While the buildings were better than the shanty towns found elsewhere, with toilets, running water, and a power supply, they were not blessed with work opportunities, and the poor remained horribly impoverished.</p>
<p>One beneficiary of Ford’s free food was Bob Marley, who said that without Ford’s efforts, he would have starved. Ford got the credit for writing several of Bob’s songs, including "No Woman, No Cry." There have been numerous theories as to why Bob might have given away the publishing credits to one of his biggest songs; this is not the place to discuss them, but if he really did, and Ford did not write it, the charitable older man certainly needed the royalties it would have brought in. It was an elegant way for Bob to repay him for his vital kindness. Neither party ever broke the pact that said that Ford wrote the song. In the 90s, Ford was a regular presence at the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston, a living testament to Bob’s struggles – and ultimate victory over poverty.</p>
<p>There have been numerous covers of "No Woman, No Cry." The Fugees hit with it in 1996. It was reinterpreted by <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/nina-simone/"><strong>Nina Simone</strong></a>, which was quite a coup for Bob, as she had been a strong influence over reggae music and he had sung on cover versions of her "Sinnerman" while he was still fighting for a break. South African township music pioneer <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/hugh-masekela-politics-feature/">Hugh Masekela</a></strong> recorded it in 1989. Artists as diverse as Joan Baez, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/pearl-jam/">Pearl Jam</a>,</strong> and Naughty By Nature have been drawn by its soulful beauty. Even the young classical music sensation, celloist Sheku Kannah-Mason, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/bob-marley-sheku-kanneh-mason/"><strong>released a version in 2018</strong></a>, helping him to break into the mainstream. In 1975, reggae legend Derrick Morgan wrote an answer song, "Some Woman Must Cry," which explained that women had a right to cry considering the appalling way they were treated by their menfolk. But none could match the impact of Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers’ live version of "No Woman, No Cry" – an anthem for all times.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Released on July 17, 2015, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-chemical-brothers/">The Chemical Brothers</a></strong>’ eighth studio album, <em>Born In The Echoes</em>, followed 2010’s dancefloor-filling of <em>Further</em> and the duo’s first full soundtrack, the following year’s <em>Hanna</em>. Featuring a ton of guests, and memories, it also provided Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons with yet another chart-smashing bonanza.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://udiscover.lnk.to/The-Chemical-Brothers-Born-In-Echoes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen to <em>Born In The Echoes</em> now</a>.</strong></p>
<h2>Plundering history</h2>
<p><em>Born In The Echoes</em> kicks off with the single “Sometimes I Feel So Deserted,” which utilizes the services of ex-One True Voice vocalist Daniel Pearce and which, as with many of the group’s hits, was also part of their <em>Electronic Battle Weapon</em> dancefloor series; the track further benefitted from a slow-building remix by high-profile post-dubstep producer Skream.</p>
<p>Pearce, meanwhile, had become a regular frontman for dance records, and thus started the album’s “echoes” theme off nicely, the Chems clearly referencing their history of plundering from (and otherwise revising) history – a theme which they had shown interest in all the way back to their degrees at The University Of Manchester. The slightly disturbing video for the single began their productive relationship with Ninian Doff as well.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/saZVNLMMmmo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Another single follows, in the form of the peppy, bass-heavy, electroid “Go,” which features the widescreen return of the New York-born Golden Age rapper Q-Tip (from A Tribe Called Quest), who had previously hosted the Chems’ hit 2004 single “Galvanize.” The typically stylish Michel Gondry video didn’t hurt the track, either. Further single “Under Neon Lights” is fronted by the wispy, reflective, Cocteau Twins-esque vocals of indie darling Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent. An appropriately neon-filled, 20th-century-vibed rush of a video was created for the track by director Adam Smith, while the track also inspired <a href="https://www.zacharyrichter.com/chemical-brothers-under-neon-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>the first-ever virtual reality video made on the web</strong></a>, by creative mastermind Zach Richter.</p>
<h2>Looking to the future</h2>
<p>The riddling, twitching, big-room vintage synth hymn “EML Ritual” is next, bringing back Ali Love – as heard on the Chems’ 2007’s album, <em>We Are The Night</em> – to lose his mind, and to open up an extended segment of pounding grooves. The group’s ongoing late 60s psych influence re-emerges on “I’ll See You There,” which finds the echo itself (some hip vintage poetry) looking to the future.</p>
<p>The punishing, 90s rave exclamation-fuelled bleepy electro-techno of “Just Bang” is right on its heels, and, as ever with the Chems, blends eras of popular music into one whole. The blinking, teetering, growling techno of “Reflexion” then completes this suite, before stepping down into the relatively brief, buzzing, downtempo interlude “Taste Of Honey,” which has vocals from Chenai Zinyuku (who later worked with Cassius and Gorgon City) and Stephanie Dosen.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BC2dRkm8ATU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<h2>Return once more</h2>
<p>The elegantly sliding title track merges Cate Le Bon and some cavernous, guttural synths, before the overloaded, beacon-like “Radiate” flashes out into the darkness, and the gentle single “Wide Open” finishes the album with a poignant, undervalued Balearic <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/beck//">Beck</a></strong> house vocal: a slow-burning future rare-groover.</p>
<p><em>Born In the Echoes</em>’ artwork sticks to the echoes theme, being clipped from a 19th-century fabric pattern, with caricatures of Rowlands and Simons appearing to pop out from among sound waves. We are all born in the echoes, and in the wake of The Chemical Brothers’ great 2019 follow-up, <em><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/chemical-brothers-no-geography-album/">No Geography</a></strong></em>, now is a good time to return to them once more.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Spencer Davis may always be best known for the 1965-67 period when his group, featuring brothers <a title="Steve Winwood" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/steve-winwood"><strong>Steve</strong></a> and Muff Winwood and Pete York, recorded a string of UK and international hits. But the Welsh guitarist and keyboard player, born in Swansea on July 17, 1939, entertained people live on stage for about 60 years.</p>
<p>The original quartet came together under the guise of the Muff-Woody Jazz Band, with Pete York, “Muff” Winwood and his mid-teenaged brother Steve, and then the Rhythm &amp; Blues Quartet. “They were playing in a pub in North Birmingham,” Davis told <em>Mojo</em> magazine of the Winwood brothers in 1996. “Steve was playing the piano like <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/oscar-peterson/">Oscar Peterson</a></strong> and singing like <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/ray-charles/"><strong>Ray Charles</strong></a>. He was brilliant – exactly what I needed.”</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHSpfR0naB4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<p>In 1964, now under the SDG name, the quartet caught the eye of Chris Blackwell, by now running the fledgling Island Records, and momentum began to build alongside the group's live reputation. After some lower-charting singles, the group’s time-honored hits included the consecutive British chart-toppers “Keep On Running” and “Somebody Help Me” and the rock staples <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/spencer-davis-group-gimme-some-lovin-song/"><strong>“Gimme Some Lovin’”</strong></a> and “I'm A Man.” But they represented just one chapter in Davis’ distinguished career.</p>
<h2>‘We thirsted for American music’</h2>
<p>Spencer always wore his love of American blues and R&amp;B proudly on his sleeve. It was a devotion instilled as a teenager growing up in south Wales, when he was wooed by trailblazers such as Lead Belly and Big Bill Broonzy. “We hungered for, thirsted for American music,” he said later. “It was like discovering gold in your kitchen closet.”</p>
<p>The group carried on, after Steve Winwood’s departure, until 1969, and reunited for a short time in the 1970s. Davis interspersed that with solo recordings and other work, and in more recent years toured with the latter-day SDG as well as with the Rock and Roll Army, featuring such fellow notables as Mitch Ryder, Felix Cavaliere and Rick Derringer. 2006 also brought the new album and DVD, <i>So Far.</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/spencer-davis-dead-81/"><strong>Davis died on October 19, 2020,</strong> </a>at the age of 81. Winwood said in a statement of their early years together: “I’d already got a big brother who influenced me greatly, and Spencer became like a big brother to me at the time. He was definitely a man with a vision, and one of the pioneers of the British invasion of America in the sixties.”</p>

                        <p>In 1963, <a title="Marvin Gaye" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/marvin-gaye"><strong>Marvin Gaye</strong></a> was packin’ up his bags and hitch hiking to his baby. In 1970, Vanity Fare were “Hitchin’ A Ride.” In July 1971, <a title="Creedence Clearwater Revival" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/creedence-clearwater-revival"><strong>Creedence Clearwater Revival</strong></a> were telling us about their <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0UOguLYTbPVXplQwFBpaDH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>“Sweet Hitch-Hiker,”</strong></a> and landing yet another <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 entry. It was to be the group’s last US Top 10 hit.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHHEUyWJXhM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Including chart entries for several of the flip sides of their 45 rpm releases, “Sweet Hitch-Hiker” was Creedence’s 18th singles chart appearance in less than three years. Written by John Fogerty and produced by the group, it came out as a single on Fantasy well ahead of what became <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/creedence-clearwater-revival-mardi-gras-album/"><strong>the parent album</strong></a>, <em>Mardi Gras</em>, the 1972 set that appeared just before CCR split up.</p>
<p>It was an LP that saw the songwriting credits spread around the now-three piece band, with contributions by both Stu Cook (including the single B-side “Door To Door”) and Doug Clifford. But <em>Mardi Gras </em>would later be described by Mojo magazine as “a misbegotten exercise in democracy.”</p>
<h2>Flyin’ to the Greasy King</h2>
<p>Essentially a biker song, the lyric of “Sweet Hitch-Hiker” has Fogerty “cruisin’ on through the junction, flyin’ ‘bout the speed of sound” when he sees the girl of the title. The lyric refers to the Greasy King, the nickname of a real-life restaurant in the band’s home town of El Cerrito, California.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the official </strong><a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/03anKRkjPgl5GtFLtipMpY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>The Year 1969</strong></a><strong> playlist, featuring </strong><strong>Creedence Clearwater Revival and other favorites.</strong></p>
<p>“Sweet Hitch-Hiker” entered the Hot 100 for the week of July 17, 1971 at No.68, as Carole King entered her fifth and final week at No.1 with the double-sided <em>Tapestry </em>hit “It’s Too Late”/“I Feel The Earth Move.” The CCR song rose swiftly, to spend two weeks at No.6 in August. <em>Mardi Gras </em>then offered up another top 30 single in “Someday Never Comes,” but the group’s dazzling run of Top 10 hits was finally at an end.</p>
