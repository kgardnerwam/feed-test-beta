<p>In the video for <strong>Peaches</strong>’ latest single, <em>Pussy Mask</em>, we watch an animated vulva navigate the pandemic. Wearing a dampened surgical mask over its mouth, it hops through a series of surreal cartoon landscapes, showering its surroundings with sprinkles of water. “My pussy wear a mask, take cover from the spray,” the vulva sings, merrily, as it bounces past an applauding Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. “My pussy wear a mask, drippinʼ droplets all day.”</p>
<p>It’s the kind of brash, bawdy fun that Peaches has become known for. An unapologetic provocateur, she has a multi-dimensional approach to music, crafting tracks and visuals that feel more like mischievous conceptual art pieces. While other artists might sing about sex alluringly, Peaches screeches about it – and the mess, stench, stickiness and absurdity that comes along with it.</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Genesis </strong>is blazing a similar trail. The singer and model – who, like Peaches, hails originally from Canada – has been drawing attention for her equally confrontational style of (self-described) “fetish rap”. On her 2015 debut, <em>World Vision</em>, she shared songs that were queer, playful and lyrically hardcore, with visceral verses about her sexual fluidity (and seeking comfort in “yoghurt covered pretzels” and a “pound of clit”). Although less in-your-face, Genesis’s new album, <em>goldilocks x</em>, sticks to the same ethos: create raw, raucous, emboldening music that cuts through the dull, “palatable” sexuality of mainstream pop.</p>
<p>Here, in a Zoom conversation held earlier this year, the artists meet for the first time to discuss their inspirations and mutual adoration. “I love your music, it has such a vibe,” Peaches gushes to Genesis in the opening minutes of the call. “Thank you,” she replies. “I feel like I’ve always known your name and your songs. You’re an icon.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="usgAsgYIYq4"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/usgAsgYIYq4" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>AnOther Magazine: How have you both been over the last two years? Has it been a creative time? </strong></p>
<p>Peaches: I had a shitty, shitty time. [Laughs.]. For the last 20 years of my life, I probably toured 100 dates a year – like a touring whore – so it was a huge change for me. I’m not normally a homebody. I have a great partner, who’s super compassionate, and we started working on my album together, but somehow in my mind I was just really freaked out. I was thinking, “Why? What is it all for?” I’m just being real with you, because probably a year ago I wouldn’t have even admitted all this. But yeah, it was really tough.</p>
<p>Tommy Genesis: I’m actually a homebody, so I’m the opposite. I actually don’t really leave my house except if it‘s my own show or a friend’s show, or if I walk my dog or see a friend. But when the pandemic started, it was almost like the collective was going through changes. It was wild. Everyone I knew was fucking shedding like snakes.</p>
<p>P: Yes.</p>
<p>TG: My entire world also changed. And change is weird because when it happens – even if it’s the most positive change – something feels devastating because you have to relearn how to be yourself in a new situation. The joy doesn’t come right away. So for a period of time, maybe like three months after the pandemic hit, I just let myself feel that shit. I didn’t make any music. I just let myself go there. I have a pretty happy disposition, so I was still bobbing around, but inside I was not OK. I think what really saved me was my dog [Laughs.]. I got him right at the beginning of the pandemic and I swear to god he fucking saved my life. He is literally pure love. Every day he wakes me up and licks my face.</p>
<p>P: Me and my partner talked about getting a dog the whole time, but instead we ended up buying a place. I found this live-work space in an old warehouse, and we decided to build a studio. When you buy a place with a partner, you both learn so much about each other and how you communicate. I thought I was so direct, but I found out about my passive-aggressive leanings.</p><blockquote>
<p>“With music, you can play one chord and repeat it 100 times, and you have a song. There are so many ways to do it, it just needs to feel right for you” – Peaches</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>AM: You’re both known for having quite brash, fearless musical personas. How close do you feel to them?</strong></p>
<p>TG: People don’t understand that [my persona] is still part of me. It’s not even separate from me; it’s me. I’m just focusing on certain [aspects of my character]. I think it’s easy to say that it’s a persona, because it’s harder to swallow if it really is that person. Do you know what I mean? Like, I’m so shocking that it’s hard to swallow, so you’ve got to call it a persona. It‘s like, well, what if that’s just me? [Laughs.].</p>
<p>P: Yeah I totally agree with that, it’s so true. It’s just a focus. You know when you watch a movie and they take out the boring parts to make it more direct? It’s the same concept. We’re talking one-on-one now, but when I’m on stage I’m projecting to 5,000 people, so that’s obviously going to be a different discourse. It’s a different way to express yourself.</p>
<p>TG: People would never go up to Drake or Future and ask about their persona. So why do we get asked? It’s a different conversation when you’re a woman; like we’re shocking in some way, but we’re not shocking to ourselves.</p>
<p>P: It’s the same with the sexual discourse. It’s way more of a thing when we do it, but not when, say, Future does it.</p>
<p>TG: I don’t know why [that is]. I don’t know if it’s because we’re so vulnerable. It’s interesting; it’s definitely not offensive.</p>
<p>P: Maybe it’s because we don’t fit into an obvious pop format.</p>
<p><strong>AM: Well you both come from art backgrounds, right? </strong></p>
<p>TG: I’ve been making art since I was a baby. My mom put me in piano lessons, encouraged crafts, painting and drawing. You would walk into our house when I was little and she had made everything in there. Everything I was wearing she had made. She’s just so creative, and she doesn’t even think of herself as an artist.</p>
<p>P: I love that. That’s something I craved as a child but I didn’t get.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="W0cMYteDA1w"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0cMYteDA1w" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>TG: You gave it to yourself later.</p>
<p>P: Yes, definitely. I didn’t know what art school was. I really didn’t get it. I didn’t understand that I could be a musician, but somehow I was always drawn to it instinctively. It’s crazy how anyone can make music or make art: there’s almost this belief that it’s too difficult. I’ve tried to tell people that anyone can draw: you can literally just throw some paint at something. You can be avant-garde, it can be a concept. With music, you can play one chord and repeat it 100 times, and you have a song. There are so many ways to do it, it just needs to feel right for you. It’s more of a headspace. How do you find the confidence to express yourself? It seems like such a scary thing for so many people to get close to; to be comfortable expressing themselves that freely. You just have to want to do it, it isn’t always that scary. </p>
<p>TG: For me, it’s definitely just about feelings. I’ve always had to make things because I have to get them out. That’s how music started, that’s why I draw. I just have feelings that I don’t necessarily even want to talk about. I put them into a song and it’s like my own way of dealing with it. I’ve always used music and drawing and writing as a portal to just throw shit into. Some people throw it into their job or into their hobby – we all have different gifts and interests. </p>
<p>P: Creativity is just a way to bring joy and meaning into your life. It helps you to [confront] the difficult parts, and find a way to go through them.</p><blockquote>
<p>“So many mainstream artists are just as sexual, just as extreme, but it is all packaged and fed to you in a certain way. We’re both maybe more raw” – Tommy Genesis</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>AM: What about the word “extreme”? How do you feel about that word, and about people using it to define the art that you make?</strong></p>
<p>TG: I like it.</p>
<p>P: I feel like I am coming directly from what I think and feel, so it’s interesting to see all the different ideas and misconceptions that people have about that. </p>
<p>TG: Yeah. At first, I was very shocked that people were shocked [by my work]. But then I thought it was fun. I like to shock; I don’t mind being called extreme. I don’t think I am, but it doesn’t really bother me. So many mainstream artists are just as sexual, just as extreme, but it is all packaged and fed to you in a certain way. We’re both maybe more raw. We’re obviously writing everything, doing our own visuals, doing everything ourselves, so it’s shocking because it feels like you’re getting the raw person, which you are. It feels weird.</p>
<p><strong>AM: Do you think that authenticity is rare in mainstream music?</strong></p>
<p>TG: I think so. I don’t want to discredit those rappers or artists that are writing their own songs. And I’m not even saying it’s a bad thing [if they’re not] – at a certain point you need the help, because you’re just operating on such a bigger level. But I’m just saying when the lens is so much more focused, and when you’re choosing to be in this in-between space, that’s where it feels more raw. I’m not saying either is bad or good. </p>
<p>P: I like the in-between space. I feel like I can operate on that level. Maybe it’s also a control issue. [But] if I did become mainstream, I'm not mad at it either. I’ve always said that. I want the mainstream to come closer to me, rather than me going closer to the mainstream. </p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="qaMW0bJhOr4"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qaMW0bJhOr4" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>AM: Do you think that’s happened over the last few years? Have there been signs of progress?</strong></p>
<p>P: Yes. I believe that everything grows exponentially in every direction. So if you pick the direction where the mainstream grew closer to me, then yes. But if you are looking at Texas and abortion laws, then no. </p>
<p><strong>AM: Finally, how do you both keep things fluid creatively? What makes you feel inspired, how do you fight off blocks?</strong></p>
<p>TG: I have zero pressure for myself. I really have no rules. It’s important not to be hard on yourself. If I wake up and don’t feel like doing anything that day, I don’t do anything that day. I really just go where the light is. I just don’t ever do anything I don’t want to do – that’s just my mantra, I don’t care. If I’m trying to do something and there’s a block, I just walk away from it. The next time I come back to it, I’m in the headspace. So I think that’s important: if it’s not working, it doesn't matter. We’re just humans on this planet, making little things.</p>
<p>P: Exactly.</p>
<p>TG: None of this matters. What does matter is how you feel. Are you happy? Are you enjoying your life? Do what makes you happy. Super cliche answer. </p>
<p>P: I love ‘go where the light is.’ I find your words inspiring. </p>
<p>TG: We can be friends. I think you’re cool as fuck.</p>

<p><strong>Fiorucci</strong> has a long history of working with artists. In the 80s, founder Elio Fiorucci invited Keith Haring to collaborate – the artist, with the help of his 16-year-old protégé Angel Ortiz AKA LA II, spray-painted the walls of the first Fiorucci store in Milan’s Galleria Passarella.</p>
<p>It was in this same spirit that the incumbent creative director of the label, Daniel Fletcher, invited <strong>Lakwena Maciver</strong> to team up on a capsule collection. Based in London, Lakwena is known for her large-scale paintings employing bright colour and bold text, which often appear in public spaces in the form of murals. These murals, which Lakwena says can be understood as “escape routes, afrofuturistic portals to utopia” are, in some ways, reminiscent of Fiorucci’s stores, which have historically been filled with brightly-coloured objects.</p>
<p>The starting point for this collection began with a visit to Fiorucci’s archive, where Lakwena learned about the brand’s connection to disco; to people dancing, celebrating and having a good time. And while that moment cannot be recreated, it’s this energy that she wanted to channel into the collection. Through further research, she identified more crossovers between Fiorucci and her work; between Fiorucci’s relationship with disco and her own relationship with gospel – a musical culture that is similarly centred around ideas of connectedness, spirituality and joy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fiorucci.com/eu/lakwena-collection">The resulting collection</a> melds Fiorucci’s visual language with that of Lakwena, combining kaleidoscopic colours, reworked logos and original motifs. Taking cues from another musical culture, UK garage, the collection features all-over print denim jacket and jeans, shirts and velvet flares, along with Lycra tops emblazoned with Fiorucci’s iconic Angels motif. A satin colour-block bomber is accompanied by hoodies, sweatshirts, T-shirts, trousers and shorts, featuring a Fiorucci logo and an original hand motif by Lakwena, in a gesture of prayer or praise.</p>
<p>Lakwena’s collaboration with Fiorucci is presented via images and a film created by Ruth Ossai, starring a gospel choir who, diverse in age and size, encapsulate this idea of coming together and deliver an uplifting message of connectedness and joy – perhaps in a time when we need it the most. Here, in a conversation taken from a limited edition zine celebrated the collection published by <em><a href="https://dstassiart.com/">D’Stassi Art</a></em><em>,</em> the artist delves into this collection and its inspirations.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><strong>Ted Stansfield: Can you introduce yourself and your artistic practice?</strong></p>
<p>Lakwena Maciver: I’m an artist based in Dalston, London. My work tends to be very large-scale. I do murals and installations. It’s very colourful and I use a lot of text – that’s really key.</p>
<p><strong>TS: And can you tell me about your name and how it relates to your practice?</strong></p>
<p>LM: My name means ‘messenger’ in Acholi, which is my father’s language. And my work is very much about messages. It’s about speech and speaking truth and hope into spaces.</p>
<p><strong>TS: What kind of messages are you wanting to communicate?</strong></p>
<p>LM: A lot of the messages are positive, but it’s not really about positivity. I think it’s partly that I am naturally a bit pessimistic, and life is difficult. So in a way, I’m speaking these messages to myself. But I’m also speaking to others. I’m trying to speak truth into life.</p>
<p><strong>TS: What does Fiorucci represent to you?</strong></p>
<p>LM: I was really interested in Fiorucci’s history of collaboration and community; creative community. From what I’ve read, and what I’ve heard, there was this incredible moment in the 70s and 80s, when people were coming together and something really creative was emerging, in a very organic way. I found that really exciting.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/410/5/415877.jpg" alt="Fiorucci x Lakwena" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p><strong>TS: Because Fiorucci actually has its own history of collaborating with artists. You know, they worked with Keith Haring. How did it feel to be stepping into that legacy?</strong></p>
<p>LM: It’s amazing that Fiorucci collaborated with people like Keith and Madonna. And it’s really nice, actually, because when I was in New York, I painted the Bowery Wall, which is a really iconic wall in New York, that was first painted by Keith. Doing this collaboration is like another way of connecting with that.</p>
<p><strong>TS: It’s interesting that Keith did graffiti art and you do wall murals.</strong></p>
<p>LM: Yeah. He studied fine art, but made loads of work in public spaces. He straddled the worlds of fine art and street art, and did so in a really powerful way. I think he’s amazing. And I love the idea.</p>
<p><strong>TS: In terms of this collaboration, have you thought about the relationship between art in public spaces and then on people, through clothes?</strong></p>
<p>LM: Yeah, I love that. Because my vision for my work is that it isn’t just in galleries. So for me, making work in public spaces, it’s accessible, it’s large-scale, it can be really immersive, and it connects with people who wouldn’t normally walk into a gallery. I want to make work that speaks to ordinary people and speaks to lots of different types of people, so that’s why I like making work in public spaces. And in terms of fashion, I think fashion is another really interesting way that our culture connects with images, that everyday people connect with visual culture. We all wear clothes, we all have to wear clothes, so what do we adorn ourselves with? What do we put on? So the idea that I’m now, by this collaboration, making images that people are going to be wearing, in public spaces. I think it is really interesting.</p>
<p><strong>TS: So how did you approach the collaboration? What was your starting point?</strong></p>
<p>LM: I started by looking through the book [<em>Fiorucci: Tyes and Tribes</em>], because I wanted to understand a bit about Fiorucci and its history. From what I learned, it was very much about community – the clothes were almost secondary, the primary thing seems to have been about people and this organic creativity; people who were involved in music, art, the whole thing together. I was thinking about how disco was central to Fiorucci and how the gospel is central to my work. Because there’s a really interesting crossover between gospel and disco.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>TS: So let’s talk about that crossover. Disco is about people coming together – Black, white, gay, straight – and celebrating.</strong></p>
<p>LM: Yeah, congregating.</p>
<p><strong>TS: What are the similarities that struck you?</strong></p>
<p>LM: It’s that thing of people coming together, which is really powerful, isn’t it? Coming together to celebrate, coming together to escape, and coming together regularly, so that it becomes part of your life. You live it. But also, my work explores this yearning for paradise and even the word ‘paradise’. I mean that crops up so much in disco, doesn’t it? Interestingly, it doesn’t crop up so much in gospel, but it pops up loads in the scriptures, and the concept of heaven is all over the music. So this yearning for paradise, utopia, heaven, all of these types of words, really link these two genres. That’s what I was interested in.</p>
<p><strong>TS: And is your work about sort of longing for paradise here, too? Like, redemption? </strong></p>
<p>LM: Yeah, it’s not just waiting. It’s the now and not yet.</p>
<p><strong>TS: Can you tell me about the original motifs you created for the collection?</strong></p>
<p>LM: I’m really interested in typography – words, but also how they look. So I went through Fiorucci’s digital archive and found all of these words like heaven and paradise, which resonate with me but were also really infused in Fiorucci’s story. And I picked them out and I started to draw them, embellish them and play around with them, and I made this big print, which brought all of that together.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>TS: And then you created a film with Ruth Ossai and Theo White.</strong></p>
<p>LM: So I thought about having a gospel choir involved in the project, as that would be a way of bringing people into it, because I thought that was really important. I could do some really interesting artwork, and put it on some clothes, but what was really important was bringing people into it, because community is so key to Fiorucci. So that’s kind of where I started my thinking. A friend of mine, Ruth Ossai, agreed to film it and another friend, Theo White, styled it. And we haven’t worked together before, but it was so much fun. It just felt really natural, really organic.</p>
<p>I didn’t want some corporate choir, I wanted a choir who had formed organically and who were about community. 15 years ago, my sister Abimaro was in a choir with some friends when they were at college. And they used to do church events – conventions, as we called them – in rundown community halls, very low-key but so much fun. And I knew that they would bring the energy that I wanted to express.</p>
<p>There was a real vibe. I was in and out of the room, but while the girls were having their hair and make-up done, they were warming up and it was just beautiful. This was the first time that they’d got back together in 15 years and, you know, they were teenagers then and now they’re grown women with completely different lives. But they remembered all their songs and the singing was beautiful. People were in tears listening to it. It was beautiful.</p>
<p>And the community hall was really nice, because the space that we found to shoot was a space that me and my sister had both been involved in. I used to take my kids there for playgroups and she has done workshops with young people and old people in the local community there, so it just felt really natural, really organic, exactly what we wanted.</p><p><strong>TS: Where is this community hall?</strong></p>
<p>LM: It’s east London. We really wanted to find a place in south London because that was just so much the essence of the thing, but this was very similar in aesthetic – the muted pink and yellow, and mint green walls, everything patched together and the dingy light which is a bit grimy but also feels homey in a weird way. And it doesn’t feel showy, it just feels natural.</p>
<p><strong>TS: At fashion month, a lot of designers were exploring ideas of freedom and escapism, and offering an antidote to the pessimism that’s everywhere. That feels quite relevant to this collaboration in a way. How do you feel about that, and what do you want people to take away from this collection? </strong></p>
<p>We’ve been working on this for quite a long time, in the midst of lockdown and all of that, so that’s definitely part of the story. We’ve been kept away from each other and gospel and disco are very much about being with each other. And not just being together but celebrating. I hope people get that feeling from the clothes, that they are about having fun.</p>
<p><strong>TS: So how would you describe the spirit of the collection?</strong></p>
<p>LM: I’d probably describe the spirit of the collection as celebrating life together.</p>

<p>Photographer <strong>Quil Lemons</strong> has laid bare the beauty of the mundane in his hometown of South Philadelphia in <em>6 7</em>, a new visual series for WePresent marking his most personal project yet. Returning to the neighbourhood that raised him at the height of the pandemic, Lemons documents a family block party celebrating his grandmother’s 67th birthday – an occasion used to capture the essence of Black love and community amid grief, loss and societal upheaval in a sublimely shot photo series featuring those closest to him. </p>
<p>“I was inspired by what living life in the past year has looked like,” he tells AnOther. “What we went through with Covid and lockdown, Black Lives Matter, my dad being in jail and the loss of two of my relatives. At that same time, my entire career was exploding too so my family was in this limbo of grieving but also celebrating life and figuring out how to navigate it in the midst of a pandemic.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Lemons, who is known for signature soft portraits of subjects that tell authentic stories of queerness, race, body positivity and masculinity, is the youngest person to have ever shot the cover of <em>Vanity Fair</em> – a career breakthrough he achieved earlier this year at the age of 23. The rest of his catalogue includes his 2017 debut series <em>GLITTERBOY</em> which tackled the damaging stigmas and stereotypes of hypermasculinity within Black men, while his 2018 follow-ups <em>PURPLE</em> and <em>WELCOME HOME</em> focused on African-American families.</p>
<p>He revisits this exploration by pointing the lens back at his own family in <em>6 7 </em>with a selection of photos uniquely named with individual messages. “The names for each of the images are slang terms used by Philadelphians that may not be obvious to the wider audiences but locals will know it,” he explains. “One of my favourite shots is a picture of my aunt who is a minister holding an AR15 gun. I wanted to play around with the idea of what it means to be a minister and the theme of protection. It was just crazy to see a Black woman with a large rifle.” </p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>Another timeless theme Lemons delves into is the idea of grief and societal takes on what it looks like. He puts forth the reality of pain co-existing with the joys of life, with his family as a prime example. “Grieving is not something that is as dark as we’d like to think. I don’t think that we really address that,” he says. “I think we try to fast forward and get over it but it’s something we need to learn to live with. It’s a natural part of life that we don’t really talk about. In my family, this loss was the first one I’d experienced with people close to me and it was really interesting that none of us had the language to talk about it.” He compares this overarching surface-level glance at grief to the attitudes towards Black lives and the Black experience in the mainstream world of arts.</p>
<p>“Photographically, everyone wants these beautiful Black portraits but no one wants to talk about how dark it is to be a Black person in America,” adds Lemons. “It’s hella dark, but I think that also allows us to really enjoy the beautiful moments when we do have them. That’s what this whole series at the block party is about. We’ve been through a lot of shit so let’s actually just celebrate being alive.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Currently based in Brooklyn, Lemons left South Philadelphia after graduating in 2015. It was the first time he’d stepped away from the place he called home and the people he’d known his entire life, including the 150 relatives he has in the area. While he visits regularly, things are ever-changing in his old neighborhood. “South Philly is going through crazy gentrification right now, it’s like two cities in one. The entire neighborhood is completely changing every second so when I come home there’s always another building that has disappeared that has been there my entire life,” he says. “There was a church next to my grandmother’s house that is completely gone now. They’ve turned it into an apartment complex and it’s pushing us all out. It’s so disorienting and very othering too because if we can’t live here then where do Black people go? How do we keep going in a place that constantly tells us we can’t be here?” </p>
<p><em>6 7 </em>embodies these concepts by simply showcasing Black life as it is in South Philadelphia – a city that is as rich in food, culture and resilient joy as it is in crime, violence and socio-economic struggles. In 2021 alone, the city has seen <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/extremely-disturbing-philly-approaches-500-people-murdered-in-2021/">over 500 homicides</a>, a statistic that won’t surprise natives including Lemons. This juxtaposing reality of life in the city is what shapes not only his photo series but Lemons’ creativity overall. “South Philly can be rough but it is also a real food city, a real culture city. We have a lot of major talents and cultural icons who are all from here but it’s very much overlooked because everyone is focused on cities like New York, LA and Atlanta. We have a huge cultural hub for art and creativity here too,” he says. “I definitely have to give back to my city in that way and make sure it doesn’t get erased. You can feel that in my work.” </p>

<p>In 1976, <strong>Sunil Gupta</strong> began shooting a series that would shape his career. Born in New Delhi and raised in Montreal, the photographer was in New York studying with Lisette Model at the time, spending weekends in the West Village. His black and white images of men on Christopher Street have since come to define a celebratory time for the gay community, photographed after Stonewall uprising but before the Aids crisis. Moving to London a few years later, he sought to revisit the concept, swapping out the West Village for west London.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“I arrived in Earl’s Court because I’d heard that was the London equivalent of the West Village, and actually it was nothing like it,” he says. “There was a brief gay renaissance around Habitat on the King’s Road. There used to be a café on the first floor which became a gay hangout, until they wised up to it and actively tried to stop you from coming in.” The prejudice was potent: while sex between men had long been legal, cruising had effectively been criminalised. “It became like prostitution,” he adds.</p>
<p>Unable to pursue his original idea – <a href="/art-photography/12846/sunil-gupta-lovers-ten-years-on-book-stanley-barker-photography-interview">at least not until a few years later </a> – Gupta broadened the project’s scope, focusing on the people he encountered in-between lectures at the Royal College of Art. The subsequent pictures have remained largely unseen since his graduation show in 1983, and they’ve now been published in a book, <strong><em>London ’82</em></strong> (Stanley Barker Books).</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/410/5/415867.jpg" alt="Sunil Gupta 6" />        <figcaption>

<p>“My impression of London was born by seeing a film called <em>Sunday Bloody Sunday</em>, and the architecture [in Earl’s Court] looked like that: tall terrace houses with black railings,” Gupta recalls. “But I’d become fond of New York, so I was reluctant to come. It was good and bad. I’m a product of British colonial India, my upbringing was entirely in British English, so everything was familiar compared to North America. But otherwise it got a bit grim: the gay scene felt very oppressive. People were being hounded – there was literally a police campaign to arrest people.”</p>
<p>Arriving in tandem with a rise in fascism, Gupta encountered additional discrimination he’d not experienced in New York. “It was the days of the National Front, so I became mostly conscious of other Black and Asian people on the street and shot them,” he says, referencing his primary subjects. “Around where I lived, it was a mixture of people with and without money. In New York, the poor lived in one place and the rich in another, but here it was all mixed up. I lived amongst a bunch of bankers, but you’d see these pensioners with hardly any income walking around. That caught my eye too.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>People weren’t necessarily receptive to being photographed, he says, highlighting a further divide between the two cities. “In New York they didn’t care about having their photo taken. I think because there was a certain visual culture – street pictures were around us in museums and galleries back then. Here, people were wary, so I’m further away consequently.” The resulting pictures – street scenes of local subcultures, and graffiti of political note – feel removed from Gupta’s wider catalogue, foregrounding instead his early experiments with new practices (as a student at the RCA, he had access to colour printing facilities that had previously not been available to him). “It became more feasible, but the technicalities were a bit different. Colour was limiting. Also London is very high up in altitude, there’s hardly any light, so I was right on the edge of what was possible. I missed a lot – the speeds were too slow or the light wasn’t enough – but I just put the camera everywhere.”</p>

<p>Though we’re living in a digital age, consuming the majority of our media through phones and computers, nothing compares to the tangible touch of a book or magazine. This special feeling, of hand to paper, is explored to its fullest potential in the beautiful new art book <strong><em>Sarabande Bound</em></strong>, which arrives exclusively at Dover Street Market London this week.</p>
<p>Wrapped in the traditional Japanese <em>furoshiki</em> style, the handbound publication explores the beauty of paper and its vast creative possibilities. The book – which is released in a limited run of 100 – features works by 36 artists who have been supported through the Sarabande Foundation, which was launched by Lee Alexander McQueen in 2006 to nurture emerging artists and designers. No two <em>Bound</em> books are exactly alike, though each includes an array of sculpted, cut, embossed, perforated, hand-painted, embroidered, and dyed artworks.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“We challenged our artists to think outside their usual practice and present themselves in an unexpected way,” says Trino Verkade, the director of Sarabande. “The result is spellbinding – the completed artworks are entirely unique, both within the world of art and within each artist’s distinctive body of work ... binding individual works onto paper to create one larger work of art, <em>Bound</em> touches on the sense of unity within Sarabande.”</p>

<p><em>A version of this article originally appeared on AnotherManmag.com:</em></p><p>The Aids crisis of the 80s and 90s was devastating to the queer community. In America, systemic homophobia led to a slow reaction from the government, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been and should have been prevented. Widespread desperation and anger towards the government meant that HIV/Aids patients were forced to become their own advocates. From pressuring the government to provide more effective medical options, to demanding an end to employment discrimination, the Aids crisis was a time of fierce resistance.</p>
<p>As is so often the case with representations of queerness in visual art, it is difficult to find a balance between depicting the suffering of these years while documenting the tenacity and beauty of a community coming together while under siege. But in the last three decades, we have seen filmic representations of Aids that have been powerful, nuanced and complex. As well as showing us how far things have moved on, these works act as a reminder that the global Aids epidemic is far from over.</p>
<p>The Aids crisis of the 1980s claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, but their stories live on. The role of queer people in pushing for solutions, which ultimately saved millions of lives, cannot be understated. These stories, as harrowing as they are inspiring and as infuriating as they are beautiful, are forever stitched into the cultural tapestry of our community.</p>
<p>Here, we delved into the archives to reflect on some of the most powerful representations of the virus on screen.</p><h2 data-innertext="tongues untied (1989)"><em>Tongues Untied</em>, 1989</h2>
<p><em>Tongues Untied</em> is a semi-documentary film that explores Black gay identity. Blending documentary footage, personal accounts and fiction, the film breaks the silence of Black gay men who were less able to express themselves because of the prejudices of white and Black heterosexual society, as well as white gay society. The documentary explores the experience of its director, Marlon Riggs, as he comes to terms with his sexuality and copes with many of his friends dying from Aids.</p>
<p>By exploring popular culture alongside the political landscape of the late 1980s, in which homophobia was deeply imbedded, the film simultaneously debates the politics of racism, homophobia and exclusion, but also their relevance to contemporary sexual politics. With so many films focussing on a narrow experience of Aids and homophobia, <em>Tongues Untied</em> challenges the implicitly white-framing of these discussions.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2 data-innertext="philadelphia (1993)"><em>Philadelphia, </em>1993</h2>
<p><em>Philadelphia</em> is one of the first mainstream Hollywood films to simultaneously explore HIV/Aids, homosexuality and homophobia. The film follows Andrew Beckett, played by Tom Hanks, a senior associate at a successful corporate law firm in Philadelphia. Although Beckett is ‘out’ to his family and friends, and lives with his partner Miguel, he hides his homosexuality and status as an Aids patient from his work. But after a colleague notices a lesion on Beckett’s forehead, indicating he has Aids, the firm conspire to get him dismissed by hiding paperwork relating to a crucial case.</p>
<p>After being fired, Beckett sets out to sue his former employer for unfair dismissal, claiming they fired him because he was gay and had Aids. Unable to find a lawyer to represent him, personal injury lawyer Joe Miller, played by Denzel Washington, finally agrees to help him. Miller, a self-confessed homophobe, has his own attitudes challenged as the case causes the two men’s lives and values to become closely entwined. Beckett’s health rapidly deteriorates as the trial hurtles towards its conclusion, but he still has the full support of his family, partner and friends. Although it is difficult to watch at points, <em>Philadelphia</em>’s overarching message is one of love, compassion and, most of all, justice.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2 data-innertext="and the band played on (1993)"><em>And the Band Played On, </em>1993</h2>
<p><em>And the Band Played On</em> is a 1993 American television film drama based on the best-selling 1987 non-fiction book of the same name by Randy Shilts. In 1981, Don Francis begins to investigate the growing number of deaths from unexplained sources among gay men in New York City, Los Angeles and San Francisco.</p>
<p>Working with no money, limited space and old equipment, he comes in contact with politicians, medical professionals and gay activists. Francis struggles with his research, finding that those in power in the medical profession are more preoccupied with taking credit for discovering Aids than identifying its cause or a cure. Bill Kraus, an Aids activist and congressional aid played by Ian McKellen, supports Francis’s theory that HIV and Aids are sexually transmitted. But their efforts are stonewalled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The film reveals, in brutal fashion, how bureaucracy combined with a lack of urgency distracted the government’s focus from saving lives, allowing the Aids epidemic to spiral out of control.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2 data-innertext="how to survive a plague (2012)"><em>How to Survive a Plague</em>, 2012</h2>
<p><em>How to Survive a Plague</em> is a 2012 American documentary film about the early years of the Aids epidemic, focussing on the work of the organisations Aids Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) and Treatment Action Group (TAG). The documentary, like other films on this list, focuses on the US government’s failure to react to the epidemic quickly and effectively. In the early years the Aids crisis, the only approved drug available to treat HIV was AZT, which was ineffective and could cause blindness. ACT UP lobbied the FDA to shorten trials for drugs, which could take up to ten years, in order to make more drugs available. This saved over six million lives.</p>
<p>The documentary was produced using over 700 hours of original footage. This included news coverage, interviews as well as film of demonstrations, meetings and conferences taken by ACT UP members themselves. This footage shows the sheer scale of the problem and the widespread desperation of the LGBTQ+ community, but also the incredible courage and tenacity of queer people. It also displayed the shocking homophobia of lawmakers, including President George Bush, in regards to the crisis. In a particularly powerful scene, thousands of protesters descended on Capitol Hill to place the ashes of friends who they have lost on the lawn, in full view of the government.</p>
<p>The sense that history was in the making can be felt throughout the film. Most of the activists assumed they only had months to live, so fighting the virus for the next generation gave them purpose. In the closing frames, activist Peter Staley tells a crowd: “One day the age crisis will be over. When that day comes, there will be people on this earth who will hear the story that once there was a terrible disease. They’ll here that brave group of people fought, and in some cases died, so that others could be free.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2 data-innertext="dallas buyers club (2013)"><em>Dallas Buyers Club, </em>2013</h2>
<p><em>Dallas Buyers Club</em> tells the real-life story of Ron Woodroof, an Aids patient from Texas diagnosed in the mid-80s, when HIV/Aids treatments were under-researched and the disease was highly stigmatised. As HIV and Aids swept across America, the government was slow to act, embarking on a string of time-consuming trials that yielded little results as the death toll continued to rise.</p>
<p>Joining the experimental Aids treatment movement, Woodroof, played by Matthew McConaughey, smuggled unapproved pharmaceutical drugs into Texas for treating his symptoms. He formed the ‘Dallas Buyers Club’, where these drugs were distributed to paying members, which faced opposition from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Chauvinistic womaniser Woodroof enlists the help of Rayon, a trans Aids patient played by Jared Leto. The two form an unlikely friendship, as the shared experience of Aids brings them together. The film captures the sense of urgency, frustration and desperation felt by Aids patients and doctors when medical options were limited.</p>]]></content><media:thumbnail url="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1200/0-0-1350-900/azure/another-prod/410/5/415774.jpeg" caption="Tongues Untied, 1989" /><description>On World Aids Day, Louis Staples spotlights five films that look at the virus and its devastating effects</description></entry><entry><id>https://www.anothermag.com/13742</id><title type="text">“Pressure Creates Diamonds”: Virgil Abloh  Shayne Oliver In Conversation</title><summary type="html">In the wake of Abloh’s passing and last night’s tribute show in Miami, revisit a conversation between the designer and his friend and fellow designer Shayne Oliver, in which they speak on risk-taking, representation and a future renaissance</summary><published>2021-12-01T11:31:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-01T11:31:00Z</updated><author><name>Emma Hope Allwood</name><uri>https://www.anothermag.com/</uri></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/13742/pressure-creates-diamonds-virgil-abloh-shayne-oliver-in-conversation?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=RSSFeed&amp;utm_term=pressure-creates-diamonds-virgil-abloh-shayne-oliver-in-conversation" /><category term="Fashion  Beauty" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>It was a T-shirt that predicted fashion’s future.</p>
<p>That T-shirt was an off-the-cuff collaboration in 2012 between upstart New York label Hood by Air, founded in 2006 by <strong>Shayne Oliver</strong> and Raul Lopez, and Been Trill, the art and DJ collective that included <strong>Virgil Abloh</strong> (then best known for his label Pyrex Vision), Heron Preston, who launched his eponymous brand in 2017, and Matthew Williams, who founded 1017 Alyx 9SM in 2015 and, last year, became creative director of Givenchy.</p>
<p>Black and emblazoned both with Been Trill’s dripping Rocky Horror-font branding and HBA’s logo, it had an effect that, spurred on by still-fledgling social media and it being seen on Kanye West, soon snowballed beyond the garment’s intended audience, placing its creators firmly in the spotlight. An expression of downtown New York’s melting pot of music, culture, clothing and nightlife that was the backdrop for its creators, its hype-generating design foreshadowed what was to come in fashion, both literally and figuratively.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>In a matter of years, graphic-driven ‘streetwear’ would dominate the industry, with luxury houses running to keep up. Oliver would win acclaim for HBA’s collections, showcased at New York Fashion Week, while Abloh would go on to found Off-White and lead Louis Vuitton’s menswear.</p>
<p>Despite establishment approval – Oliver has taken home the LVMH Special Jury Prize and a CFDA award, and Abloh’s Off-White, bolstered by partnerships with the likes of Nike, has become one of the most coveted brands of the past decade – the two designers, both Black and American, struggled to have their work taken seriously at first, let alone understood. Oliver’s output – a confrontational blend of conceptual high fashion, hip-hop, club world and ballroom culture that resulted in voguers, Pornhub logos and double-footed cowboy boots appearing on his label’s runways – was often categorised simply as disruptive. Comments directed at Abloh, meanwhile, centred on his perceived unoriginality, or snidely accused him of not being a ‘real designer’.</p>
<p>While Abloh has blazed a trail at Louis Vuitton, Oliver has partnered with brands including Helmut Lang and Diesel, and has just relaunched HBA, which he had put on hiatus in spring 2017. He’s also been working on Leech, a shapeshifting concept that simultaneously combines and transcends music, art, fashion and performance, and Anonymous Club, the multidisciplinary creative studio and talent incubator that develops all of HBA’s visuals and content – as well as collaborating with resident artists and other partners. But all Abloh and Oliver’s work is a continuation of the conversations they started years ago, when discussions of race and identity remained conspicuously off the fashion industry’s radar.</p>
<p>Through it all, they have stayed friends. And when AnOther Magazine asked Abloh who he would like to be in conversation with for this issue, he had just one suggestion.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Virgil Abloh: Legitimately, when this came through, I was like, there’s only one person I can talk to [Laughs.].</p>
<p>Shayne Oliver: That’s what I was thinking too. Obviously, we’ve known each other for so long.</p>
<p>VA: We’ve been at this exact space – let’s not call it fashion, let’s just call it people producing ideas – for the past ten years. And now there’s been value placed on ‘fashion’, placed on ‘Black’, and there’s been value placed on what we identify ourselves with, and we’ve just been outputting, consistently true to ourselves, when no one was watching, all the way until now. Any questions people would have asked us ten years ago, we would answer the same now – the only thing is now it’s recorded on Zoom.</p>
<p>SO: We met at a time in New York when everyone was crossing paths. Through meeting Matt [Williams], and really just being in the arena where ideas usually flourish, which is downtown. Not because of the cachet of downtown, but because of people just being open to each other’s ideas – everyone was sort of figuring out what they wanted to interact with, and what made sense for their worlds. With fashion, you enter it and it’s like, all for fashion. I think that was what was intriguing about that space – we had ideas to bring to fashion, but not specifically for fashion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For 2021 the pressure’s off. There’s nothing more satisfying than instead of looking for acceptance, or looking for a fairy-tale existence, all of a sudden realising there’s no gatekeeper” – Virgil Abloh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VA: When we both started, we were kind of the outsiders making noise. And then the industry started paying close attention to it. We were telling our own stories. And when people find things viable in that, they’ll call it a word, they’ll take control of it, they’ll try to make a trend.</p>
<p>SO: And in the beginning, everyone thought it was gimmicky because no one really understood what the reference points were. Fashion likes to have pop words and things they can grab onto, to feel like they’re building a moment. So people can link adjectives to clothing, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>VA: Right. Obviously, we’re both Black and American, which are characteristics that are important to our story, as that transcends time. It could be trendy in a moment, it could be at the forefront, then there could be an attempt to unravel it by calling it streetwear or whatever, and the cycle keeps on going. In a year like 2020, when the outside world was trying to say, “Hey, we want to be inclusive, we want to be diverse,” you could forget about the existence of the narratives that we were telling. These talents were coming through in the years before 2020, and we’re still here, we’re still creating.</p>
<p>SO: A lot of times, fashion has dealt with Black conversations only through trend conversations. But the conversation that a Black person is having is not a one-time conversation.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>VA: Right.</p>
<p>SO: It’s like, we’re here, we’re creatives, we’re not going to be here and then go away. There are multitudes of European designers and there are multitudes of Black conversations. These conversations are valid because they’re continuous, actually, and we’ve been here for a while, trying to create that landscape for those kinds of things to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>VA: What you see, between you and me, is two of a multitude of approaches to bearing the weight of, “You’re the trend for the moment,” or, “You’re the outlier,” or, “We’ll let you in to occupy this space.” Or, “We’ll try and trend-ify your movement.” Or, “We won’t really count it next to the European canon, but we’ll let it live just to spice it up.” What people fail to realise is that we’re often not understood. We have a huge weight to bear for our own community and our own sets of minorities that we represent. But also, on the other hand, we are often slighted, or not given the proper space to just have the idea sit.</p>
<p>SO: That’s partially why I took a hiatus, because I want to be able to create a space for myself so that people can have a chance to speak about the world of what I represent in a more serious way than season by season ... I think that, now, I’ll be able to have more of a language and conversation via my work, because people will be educated on it.</p>
<p>VA: We could sit here all day and recap on the nuances of what the media or the critique [of our work] misses, or just its bias. The right mind can see the adjacency between myself, Kanye, Jerry [Lorenzo, of the label Fear of God], or [rising label] Bstroy, these kids in Atlanta. It’s like, we see Air Force 1s as a Tabi boot, do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>SO: [Laughs.] Yes!</p>
<p>VA: We see the barbershop, we see kids get shot, we see police, we were born with a different eye to the world. And then we each individually – Kanye to his, you to yours – packaged up our DNA of design. There’s a lineage between us that maybe a journalist just hasn’t put the categorical term on, but we can’t be preoccupied with that.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>SO: What’s so funny is, even when it comes to design, it’s a physical feat, like a struggle, in a sense, where within the production routes you’re working with, no one even understands the things that you’re inspired by. So there’s this uphill battle of, “Why is this important? Why is this being made?”</p>
<p>VA: Arthur Jafa broke it down in a very simplistic way. He was like, Black people are born conceptual artists.</p>
<p>SO: Yeah. Mmm.</p>
<p>VA: He was like, pressure creates diamonds, right? So when you’re born, you just hop on Earth at a young age and don’t understand, you don’t know, the systemic rules of the world. You only feel those when you go to school and some kid says, “You must behave like this, you must talk like this, you’re a different human being.” And then that pressure, as you grow older, it just keeps crushing down and it creates diamonds. So when we output, we conceptually do this calculation that inherently comes through our skin and our perception of our skin. So for me, instead of being hardened or pessimistic, driving myself crazy, as a profession like this can make you, that idea just sort of reorganised my operating system.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>VA: Now I always want to centralise this conversation about the missing documentation of a new voice within fashion that predominantly comes from Black culture, from pop culture, that has never been documented in a profound way. I never went to school and found a book that taught me about that in the same way I know about Leonardo da Vinci, or Yves Saint Laurent, or the way I know about Margiela. In January, I started making this sort of oracle book – it’s a figurative book, not a literal one – called Black Canon, a textbook that no one has ever made, or read, to understand why Black culture is fascinating in an artistic-production sense.</p>
<p>SO: It’s also this idea that there is a line of people who are using the same modes of communication, and every time [one] gets broken, that research library gets erased. So we always have to redo that library and, right now, it’s about keeping that library consistent. So when kids are coming up who aren’t surrounded by those same influences, they understand that there’s...</p>
<p>VA: ...A bible that you can’t erase. Not an Instagram video, right? Like, shit happens and then it disappears. And then someone can say it didn’t actually happen, because it’s not there anymore. When we were teenagers, we obsessed about shit on the internet, music videos, websites, and you realise if you type in those URLs now, they’re not there.</p>
<p>SO: Totally.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>VA: If it’s not frozen on the internet for 30 years, people will just rewrite it. So that’s what really woke me up. It’s not about what’s popping today. It’s that our archives are strong, that they are built, printed, verbalised and contextualised – that they can't be erased. It’s like, shit, I’m at Louis Vuitton. I’m not gonna make it to Louis Vuitton and be like, “I’m not gonna come out at the end of the runway because I just don’t want that pressure.” I’m gonna do that because I want other people to see that we’re active and given the opportunity. There’s a responsibility that I have to my whole community.</p>
<p>SO Where we’re coming from, you produce so young – the diamond pressing. We get so used to that high level of producing. Because anything that we present has to be stellar, you know what I mean? What you’re saying with this book is, whether it’s physical or not, it’s very, very important.</p>
<p>VA: And when you zoom out, you’ll see that I was making this book this whole damn time, right? All of a sudden HBA is linked to Ye, is linked to the countless soldiers from all the parties, you know, from Total Freedom, Arca to Venus X, everything. It’s this web. People think my career might be just me, I’m just scribing in other people’s books, it’s graffiti. It’s like, we have to write graffiti on every wall. That’s the learning of a steep ten years of understanding.</p>
<p>SO: But if it’s not documented well, the next person will have to start over, regardless of where we’re at. Period.</p>
<p>VA: I talked to Dapper Dan and it disheartened me. This man is still alive and there’s a 14-year-old in Chicago who doesn’t know who he is. I go to Instagram, and I say, “How many kids have read this Willi Smith book [Willi Smith: Street Couture]?” They’ll be like, “What are you talking about? Show me the Raf book!”</p>
<p>SO: In this hiatus, I was like, I need to make this moment work for me. What do I need to know about myself? Back in the day, I would be like, “Oh, it would be great if I can work with this artist.” Now, with this new phase I’m moving into, I can’t wait on that person to exist – I have to be that artist, I have to be that musician. Those years [at HBA] were my youth. People didn’t understand that that was actually my twenties. And I didn’t realise that I was the artist at the time. It took me until this year to understand that.</p>
<p>VA: When you don’t have access to production, everything is a ready-made. I know the canon of HBA, so I know that there’s a platform Air Force 1. I’ve said it 30 times but the Air Force 1 is a Duchamp urinal. It’s a loaded object and we know what it means. We know what it means in Harlem, we know what it means downtown, we know what it means all white, we know what it means all black. We know what it means. What we’re saying is that streetwear, as a collective consciousness of production, has already run its course – it’s on its hero’s journey. I said streetwear was dead for a reason. To give me space. But also to give space to those of us who are sitting in our studios, seeing a scene that we partook in ten years ago now evolving into a multibillion-dollar business – seeing fashion houses that were trying to say that we weren’t fashion adopting our DNA. Now we’re slipping into our 2.0 mode of production.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>SO: Mmm.</p>
<p>VA: Now we realise that we can tap into the furthest extremities of our creative brains. It doesn’t need the wow factor of 2020, which is, “Oh shit, he collaborated with, you know, ‘legend brand’, or something we didn’t think of,” because that shit is tired.</p>
<p>SO: [Laughs.] Yes!</p>
<p>VA: That came from when we had no access and needed those ready-made modes of production. That’s passé now. And what I’m excited for is Leech, seeing what that is, because I have no reference for it. Or Anonymous Club, which is like mutual aid, it’s community service to the highest degree. So that younger kids don’t feel like they have to go through the gauntlet to express themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I want to see this as a renaissance. I want to see some non-genre-defining amazingness, because I believe that our generation has that. I can’t wait to see what the pressure from 2020 built” – Virgil Abloh</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SO: What I’m hoping for with Anonymous – and speaking openly about that process – is that the kids can become more comfortable with making mistakes. I think that, right now, with Instagram, it’s just about perfection. Meanwhile, the people they look up to have flip-flopped all over the place throughout their careers. Me doing fashion concepts and all that stuff in the club world allowed me to learn about myself and learn my practice, so that I could then formalise it and do it in more of a fashion context.</p>
<p>VA And in our ecosystem, there is no sort of discipline, and that’s what makes it unique. As long as there’s space for these ideas to exist – your music project, whatever I do – I’m happy and confident, you know? For 2021 the pressure’s off. There’s nothing more satisfying than instead of looking for acceptance, or looking for a fairy-tale existence, all of a sudden realising there’s no gatekeeper. I know what I need to create with my time.</p>
<p>SO: It sounds so backwards to say, but you have to break a lot of disciplines in order to create a new version of a discipline.</p>
<p>VA: Like if you have a modern car, you don’t put the key in to turn the engine on. You just push a button. Fashion is still trying to start the car with a key.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/7/407313.jpeg" alt="Louis Vuitton Ib Kamara stylist Paolo Roversi photographer" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>SO: To me, that wonky old key is taste, right? And it’s this idea of, “Oh, no, that couldn’t work because it doesn’t look like this key that’s in our hands, so it couldn’t be the way to turn it on!” But fashion needs to make what might be considered ‘distasteful’ moves. When conglomerates first began to invite younger designers in, it was very, “Whoa, what is that decision?”</p>
<p>VA: What fashion before this era had was real renegades, whether that’s Gaultier or Alaïa, Galliano or Marc Jacobs, who is the forefather for me – they’re exuberant, plus, “Hey, I can do the conglomerate thing.” Those young talents are here today. You are one of them.</p>
<p>SO: Take Margiela at Hermès. For me, that’s what started these conversations that are now so mainstay, you know, and no one’s taking those risks.</p>
<p>VA: I think if fashion becomes a hotbed for the conversation, rather than the consumer and the trend centres dictating what’s cool, it can make those risky moves and find avant-garde, true talent that’s in the shadows. You know, there are amazing kids coming out of London, I’m sure – RCA, Central Saint Martins. But there are also kids coming from Atlanta. There are kids coming from New York, Brooklyn, the Bronx, who are Black kids, maybe with no formal training.</p>
<p>SO: When things are running amuck, people tend to go traditional, and it’s weird to see when people take that route. We have to reflect the times. We have to create that renaissance.</p>
<p>VA: What I’m excited about is the non-judgmental space. I don’t believe in genres, or disciplines of creativity, I like when they blur. I want to see this as a renaissance. I want to see some non-genre-defining amazingness, because I believe that our generation has that. I can’t wait to see what the pressure from 2020 built.</p><p><em>Hair: Odile Gilbert at Atelier68.

The featured artists range from Diane Arbus and Barbara Klemm to Susan Meiselas and Vivian Maier, the American street photographer whose prolific archive was discovered posthumously, revealing her extraordinary talent for capturing life’s quotidian absurdities.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Best known for his arresting portraits of Black sitters depicted in the style of Old Master paintings, which “raise questions about power, privilege, identity”, here Wiley takes on the subject of landscape painting. The featured works, which include film as well as painting, look at European Romanticism and “build relationships with [the gallery’s] collection of historical landscapes and seascapes by JMW Turner, Claude-Joseph Vernet and Caspar Friedrich”.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Everybody knows Fellini’s filmmaking, but few know about the importance of drawing within his practice. Now, a new exhibition at Museum Folkwang in Essen, Germany, looks to rectify this, showcasing an array of preparatory sketches from across the director’s filmography, as well as some early drawings from his former career as a caricaturist.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

This month, a new exhibition at Foto Colectania in Barcelona tracks how a number of artists have explored this “bidirectional control” within their work, looking at veteran image-makers like Diane Arbus and Richard Hamilton, and creatives with cutting-edge technological practices like Trevor Paglen and Tommy Kha, for the purpose.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

In a new show at White Cube Bermondsey, we witness this study in action in a series of works depicting various figures performing “ritual dance-like movements or classical posturing” – a powerful fusion of West African mythology and iconography, inspired by Adeniyi-Jones’ own Yoruba heritage, and what the gallery terms “the seeming immutability of the western art canon”.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Fans of Araki can now see the photographs in their entirety at the Pinault Collection in Paris – a combination of typically erotic shots of nude models, captured in the photographer’s studio, and thoughtful meditations on his new existence as a widower (think: melancholy street scenes and poetic depictions of the Tokyo skies).</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

The exhibition, at Hauser  Wirth St Moritz, will consider “the vital role that both artists, although more than a generation apart, played in the development of discussions around identity, gender, and the body in 20th and 21st century art”, the press notes expand, by examining the overlapping themes in both their oeuvres.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Bursztyn was best known for her deliberately “useless kinetic machines and scrap-metal assemblages”, to quote Leon Tovar Gallery, which offered “Dada-like commentaries on then-current conventions of art, established gender norms, her country’s uneven development, and the curtailment of sexual expression”. Around 50 such works, as well as films, installations and archival material, will feature in the show, which promises to position Bursztyn as one of Latin America’s most important 20th century sculptors.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Last night, the first in-person <strong>Fashion Awards</strong> since 2019 was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Celebrities, designers, and editors descended on the freezing cold red carpet in an array of decadent designs – singer Dua Lipa wore a sleek dress by emerging talent Maximillian, and singer Griff a romantic Simone Rocha look – for an evening which honoured the most inspiring forces in the fashion industry. Just one day after the shocking news of Virgil Abloh’s death, the event also marked a touching memorial to the visionary American designer, who passed away on the weekend following a private, two-year battle with cancer.</p>
<p>Dazed’s editor-in-chief IB Kamara was awarded the prestigious Isabella Blow Award (with photographer Campbell Addy and Dazed’s art director Gareth Wrighton accepting it on his behalf) for his “incredible” contribution to culture, art and fashion, as well as his unwavering “commitment to challenging stereotypes and the status quo.” Meanwhile Kim Jones, the artistic director of Dior men’s and Fendi womenswear, was awarded Designer of the Year; Gucci’s Alessandro Michele the Trailblazer Award; rising star Nensi Dojaka the BFC Foundation Award; and Tommy Hilfiger the Outstanding Achievement Award.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Abloh was recognised – alongside peers Alessandro Michele, Demna Gvasalia, Kim Jones, and Jonathan Anderson – with the Leaders of Change prize. The evening was also marked with several moving testimonials of his immense contribution to fashion and his warm character from the likes of Edward Enninful, Billy Porter, and friend Idris Elba. “I lost a friend, his wife lost a husband, the fashion industry lost a legend, and the world lost a special human being,” the actor told the audience. “Those who know Virgil know he would want us to have a good time. Tonight’s entire show is dedicated to Virgil Abloh’s life.”</p>

<p>In the 1980s, Vauxhall became home to Chain Reaction – the world’s first known lesbian SM club. <strong><em>Rebel Dykes</em></strong>, a film by Harri Shanahan and Sian A Williams, tells the story of the collective of queer women who founded the legendary south London club and created a community around it.</p>
<p>The group first met at Greenham Common, before eventually settling in Brixton’s squatting scene. Their surroundings, in Margaret Thatcher’s England, were far from forgiving. The women faced danger from homophobic street attacks, so lived a nocturnal life, eventually conspiring to open an SM club.</p>
<p>Chain Reaction was a space where the women lived and worked together. Many were in polyamorous relationships and explored different political ideas and aesthetics. There were SM performances and leather nights, where female sexuality was unashamedly on display. The Rebel Dykes were pro-sex work and pro-trans, at a time when such stances were even more controversial than they are now. Most of all, they were bound together by a rejection of the gendered expectation for women to be submissive and rule-abiding.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>All this was happening at the beginning of the Aids epidemic, when a tide of homophobic sentiment was building in the UK press. Many of the businesses the Dykes set up, like selling sex toys and publishing their own lesbian fetish magazines, were hampered by Britain’s draconian “decency” laws. Soon, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28">Section 28</a> began to be debated in parliament. Determined not to be silenced, the Dykes planned high-profile direct actions, like invading the BBC. They also organised demonstrations against Thatcher and protested her government’s response to the Aids crisis, galvanising the gay community at a time when they were under attack.</p>
<p>Before this documentary, the Dykes’ story had largely been forgotten. It is often left out of the history of queer movements, anarchist movements, punk and post-punk. There haven’t been any books, films or TV programmes made specifically about their subculture until now – unlike the gay male leather scene, which hasn’t experienced the same erasure. <em>Rebel Dykes</em> feels timely right now, given that there is a trend in the mainstream press for describing queer women as desexualised and apolitical. This characterisation is sometimes used to encourage animosity towards trans people – a marginalised group the Rebel Dykes became early advocates for, who are currently facing similar 1980s-style hostility in the press.</p>
<p>The film’s co-directors were both drawn towards the story by their own experiences of making art and performing in queer spaces. “I wanted to tell the story of the Rebel Dykes because I felt a kinship with their punk rebelliousness and their DIY approach to art and culture,” Shanahan tells AnOther. Williams felt a similar bond with the women. “I wanted to make the film because I’ve always felt a connection to the ethos of the Rebel Dykes,” she says. “Their art and music was a formative influence when I was playing in post-punk bands, and I was especially excited by the Rebel Dyke photographers that play with gender and identity and documented queer communities, all of which inspired my own visual art practice at the time.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="QjrHdYp5KxQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjrHdYp5KxQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>The film’s soundtrack is important in its own right. While developing the film, its makers discovered and digitised a treasure trove of largely forgotten feminist post-punk bands. Some of the music existed on a single cassette tape, because in the 1980s, all-women and lesbian bands rarely signed record deals. The bands include Mouth Almighty, first band of legendary Britpop guitarist Debbie Smith, one of UK’s most celebrated Black female guitarists.</p>
<p><em>Rebel Dykes</em> is radical in that it centers women, non-binary and trans voices within its story. The central character, Debbie Smith, is a working-class Black woman. And the film’s creators are queer women or non-binary too, from the directors to the technical and even legal teams. Siobhan Fahey, an original member of the group who began archiving its history and brought the project to its directors, stayed on as a producer. “<em>Rebel Dykes</em> is my first feature film, and although it took six long hard years to produce, it has also been wonderful,” she says. “I have loved reconnecting with old friends and making new ones. Working on this film has been a great privilege.”</p>
<p><em>Rebel Dykes </em>captures many of the elements that make queer communities special: defiance, resiliance and, of course, humour. It is a time-capsule of what it meant to be young and queer in 1980s England, while also introducing the world to the experiences of a specific and unique subculture.</p>

<p>When <strong>Emma Lewis</strong> first discovered the work of artist and activist <a href="/art-photography/13118/jebs-eye-to-eye-portraits-of-lesbians-book-interview-2021">Joan E Biren (known as JEB)</a> in 2016, she describes it as a “lightbulb moment.” Biren – who began <a href="/art-photography/13118/jebs-eye-to-eye-portraits-of-lesbians-book-interview-2021">documenting the lives of LGBTQ+ people in the 1970s</a>, and used her camera as a revolutionary tool to advance social justice for lesbians – was well known in the States. So why had Lewis, a curator at Tate Modern, never heard of her?</p>
<p>“[It] brought home to me just how narrow the scope of so-called ‘feminist’ art is within museum collections – and indeed, in my own ‘feminist’ art history education,” says Lewis. “How even the ‘feminist’ histories of art are told with a focus on a very narrow demographic of women; women who associated themselves explicitly with a certain <em>type</em> of feminism.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Today, Biren’s delicate portrait of lovers Priscilla and Regina, taken in Brooklyn, New York, in 1979, adorns the cover of Lewis’s new book, <em>Photography – A Feminist History </em>(Ilex Press/Tate). The book spans some 200 years, and over 140 practitioners, charting women’s origins in studio photography in the 1800s through to ‘selfie culture’ and Instagram aesthetics in the 21st century. Along the way, Lewis foregrounds some of the many women and non-binary photographers – hailing from all corners of the globe – who have been cast aside in favour of the few that made it into our history books.</p>
<p>“If you think about galleries, museums, the collector’s market, the publishing industry, all of these are commercial in one way or another,” explains Lewis. “And so the brutal reality is that women’s stories are made marketable – and some are more marketable than others.” When Lucy Rhiannon Cosslett covered Tate Modern’s 2019 <a href="/art-photography/12093/surrealist-artist-dora-maar-was-more-than-just-pablo-picasso-muse-tate-modern">Dora Maar</a> retrospective (curated by Lewis) for the <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/art-design/2018/10/women-artists-must-be-valued-their-work-not-their-relationships"><em>New Statesman</em></a>, she exposed the way media headlines framed the exhibition in order to generate more clicks: namely, by contextualising Maar as the wife of Pablo Picasso.</p>
<p>But clickbait culture exists to the detriment of accurate and nuanced accounts. A preoccupation with ‘marketability’ has seen the same stereotypes of women photographers throughout history emerge: our “genteel lady hobbyists”, as cited in the book’s introduction, or our “gung-ho pioneers.” Meanwhile, the thousands who don’t fit the mould – the working-class women who set up studios to make ends meet; the ordinary folk quietly recording their communities – fall through the cracks. “I wanted to get under the skin of that,” remarks Lewis. “I really wanted to interrogate it.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/410/5/415731.jpg" alt="Photography – A Feminist History" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>What <em>Photography – A Feminist History</em> is not, however, is simply an anthology of women photographers. In an industry trying to work toward ‘inclusivity’, but often falling short, women’s work is still frequently denied the same claim to universality that men’s is; images by or of women are quickly read through a ‘feminist’ lens, irregardless of the whether the artist intended them to be. This was a pitfall Lewis was careful to avoid. In her words: “There is a difference between a photograph by a woman and a feminist photograph.”</p>
<p>So what makes a <em>feminist</em> history of photography? Chiefly, the book maps photographic developments against shifting gender rights and roles, exploring how photography has borne witness to women’s social and political movements – and how, in turn, feminism has given us new ways of understanding photographs.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/410/5/415735.jpg" alt="Photography – A Feminist History" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>Across ten thematic essays, Lewis considers, among many things, how the abolitionist movement interacted with women’s entry into photography, or how work from avant garde artists of the 19th and 20th century – Lucia Moholy, Germaine Krull, Florence Henri – overlapped with notions of modernity and the ‘New Woman’. She contemplates how performative self-portraiture by Bolette Berg and Marie Høeg (Berg  Høeg), Frances Benjamin Johnston and Alice Austen preempted historic developments in queer theory in the latter 1900s, and how movements including the Feminist Sex Wars, race riots and disability activism gave rise to contemporary concerns of visibility and ‘representation’ – key motivations for artists such as Elle Pérez, Nydia Blas and Siân Davey. Other featured photographers, as well as Biren and Maar, include <a href="/art-photography/13408/poulomi-basu-the-indian-photographer-feminism-race-and-ecocide">Poulomi Basu</a>, Laia Abril, Lebohang Kganye and Mari Katayama.</p>
<p>After an illuminating phone conversation with Lewis about all of this, and more, I end on a question for her. Can (all) women ever have truly equal footing at the helm of a medium that has, historically, been so deeply rooted in our disempowerment? “Can we? Yes. Will it be a long and difficult journey? Yes.”</p>

<p>Having already showcased the <a href="/design-living/13690/five-j-horror-classics-you-need-to-watch-this-halloween">Y2K J-Horror</a> revolution, the BFI now looks to the Japanese movies that transformed the filmmaking landscape in the 1960s this December, in the latest chapter of their extensive Japan 2021 season. It is a period, without a doubt, that remains one of the most radically artistic in the country’s filmmaking history.</p>
<p>Born against a backdrop of social unrest as the country endured some of the biggest student protest movements on record, the <strong>Japanese New Wave</strong> also coincided with a period of significant societal change. Rapid economic growth ensured that the average person’s income would double by the end of the decade. Major film studios, on the other hand, faced bankruptcy as the advent of television transformed the mode of entertainment consumption. Cinema attendance halved between 1958 and 1963, with the low-key popularity of <a href="/design-living/13168/the-erotic-cinema-of-japan-in-five-boundary-pushing-pink-films">erotic “pink films”</a> screening at independent adult theatres also damaging mainstream box office profits.</p>
<p>Radical change was necessary to keep the film industry alive. And so, as the French New Wave shook thing up in the west, so too did scores of young and hungry Japanese filmmakers, as avant-garde arts scenes thrived in the metropolis of Tokyo. Emerging from the shadows of some of the country’s leading filmmakers were hungry new directors like <a href="/design-living/13547/essential-queer-cinema-from-japan-taiwan-and-south-korea-queer-east-festival">Nagisa Ōshima</a>,<strong> </strong>Seijun Suzuki and Shōhei Imamura, who were commissioned to make their own films having previously only worked as assistants.</p>
<p>While there was no distinction of vision or style shared among the New Wave directors, they were unified by their commitment to exciting new brands of filmmaking that often dealt with taboo subject matter, violence, sexuality, race relations, and alienation. They experimented radically with style and form through their editing, camerawork and narrative conventions, often blurring realism with fantasy for the purpose of cutting social commentary or just pure entertainment. The end result was a wealth of some of the most vibrant movies the country had ever seen, as the decade proved a turning point for Japanese culture, politics and society.</p>
<p>To celebrate the BFI’s Japanese New Wave programming, AnOther has highlighted five key films screening in theatres in the UK this month, with many also available via the BFI Player and via the Criterion Collection in the US. </p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2><strong><em>Woman of the Dunes</em>, 1964</strong></h2>
<p>Shot in resplendent monochrome, <em>Woman of the Dunes </em>possesses all the hallmarks of a great horror film without ever truly veering into the trappings of the genre. Dissonant strings screech as shaky-cam close-ups capture wriggling, alien-like insects over the delirious desert-scape of Japan’s Tottori Sand Dunes. Squint a bit, and these wastelands could be the planet Arrakis of <em>Dune</em>, or <em>Star Wars</em>’ Tatooine – though the images and atmosphere within better resemble that of David Lynch’s surreal debut <em>Eraserhead</em>.</p>
<p>The plot is simple: a fanatic entomologist, who snaps obscure mini-beasts on vacation, takes shelter for a night with a strange woman living at the foot of a sandy sinkhole. When he tries to leave in the morning, he finds oppressive forces of nature preventing his departure, and as sandstorms rage and the house itself shakes, silhouettes and shadows entrap him. Desperate hallucinations project surreal visions of sandy patterns and otherworldly environments (the masterful work of cinematographer Hiroshi Segawa), as the doomed protagonist falls into an intense sexual relationship with his new landlady, whose husband and daughter, she says, were lost to the desert some years ago.</p>
<p>Adapted from Kōbō Abe’s widely successful 1962 novel, <em>Woman of the Dunes </em>picked up the Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Prize upon its release in 1964, before being nominated for two Oscars the following year. Teshigahara ultimately lost the Best Director prize to Robert Wise for <em>The Sound of Music.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><strong><em>Pale Flower</em>, 1964</strong></h2>
<p>“Tokyo … It makes my head spin,” comments the narrator of <em>Pale Flower, </em>in a disorientating opening montage that combines rushing crowds, industrial plants, and busy train platforms with the sounds of screeching whistles and car horns. Ostensibly, Muraki – a yakuza just released from prison, who keeps a severed pinkie in his pocket – is talking about how the city has changed since he was imprisoned for murder. But equally, this introduction alludes to the hustle and bustle of the film’s primary focus: the illicit gambling dens of the country’s capital.</p>
<p>Set to a cacophonous score of avant-garde jazz, this noir is the tale of the aforementioned and his tentative romance with a woman named Saeko, who is so addicted to gambling that she even plays in bed. Their mutual destruction is captured in brilliant monochrome, with the film’s creative peak eventually arriving in the form of a surreal dream sequence that combines slow-motion, superimposed images and the sounds of manic laughter.</p>
<p>The film was initially shelved for months by Shochiku studio upon its completion, with its nihilistic tone deemed unsuitable for public consumption (screenwriter Masaru Baba, meanwhile, was unsatisfied with the film’s emphasis on visual and audio style). When it was eventually released, it was slapped with an adults-only rating, which actually helped it to become something of a hit. With director Shinoda a central figure within the wider Japanese New Wave, the film is now set for a UK Criterion Blu-ray release in 2022, following a pair of BFI Southbank screenings in December.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><strong><em>Tokyo Drifter</em>, 1966</strong></h2>
<p>You could be easily fooled into thinking that you were watching the trippiest James Bond film ever made with Seijun Suzuki’s <em>Tokyo Drifter </em>(also available via Criterion in the UK). Across a lean 90 minutes, this yakuza thriller covers car crushings, booby traps, free-jazz nightclubs and eyepatch-wearing gunmen, bound together by shootouts that wouldn’t feel out of place in a spaghetti western. But beyond the prototypical gangster plotting, the film is elevated to a realm of visual lucidity thanks to brilliant technicolour visuals and delirious set design, in this classic work from Seijun Suzuki – an icon of the Japanese New Wave. Put simply, this is a film that demands attention; not because it’s complicated or profound and nuanced, but because it is uncompromisingly stylish, and visually dazzling.</p>
<p>Suzuki’s prolific work rate (he’d directed nearly 40 movies by the time <em>Tokyo Drifter </em>was released) would find parallels in the similarly stimulated work of Y2K provocateur Takashi Miike (<em>Audition</em>) decades later. His eye-boggling visual style, meanwhile, has been cited as an influence on everyone from Quentin Tarantino to Jim Jarmusch. The latter director even thanked Suzuki in the credits of the 1999 mobster film <em>Ghost Dog: Way of the Samurai, </em>starring Forest Whitaker, and the film itself pays homage to the 60s director across numerous referential shots.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2><strong><em>Death by Hanging</em> (Nagisa Ōshima, 1968)</strong></h2>
<p><em>Death By Hanging’</em>s opening exposition reveals that 71 per cent of voters in a 1967 poll were <em>opposed </em>to the abolishment of the death penalty, before breaking the fourth wall to ask “Have you ever witnessed an execution?” What follows is a step-by-step examination of the horrifying process, climaxing with the repeated shot of a man being plunged through a trap door with a noose wrapped around his neck.</p>
<p>But the man sentenced to die, a Korean rapist and murderer, inexplicably survives having lost all memory of his crimes. The remainder of the film then becomes a bleak and satirical exploration of racism, colonialism and morality as the perplexed guards of a Japanese prison re-enact his crimes in an attempt to evoke a recognition of guilt, so that they can kill him all over again with a clear conscience. The film blurs moral boundaries between captive and captor, as the various ethical dilemmas of the situation are laid bare.</p>
<p>Director Nagisa Ōshima would find international fame and notoriety in the decades that followed. Sexually-explicit 1976 feature <a href="/design-living/13168/the-erotic-cinema-of-japan-in-five-boundary-pushing-pink-films"><em>In The Realm of the Senses</em></a> landed the director a court case in Japan, while 1983 war film <em>Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence</em> cast none other than David Bowie as the lead. His final film, 1999 queer samurai drama <a href="/design-living/13547/essential-queer-cinema-from-japan-taiwan-and-south-korea-queer-east-festival"><em>Gohatto</em></a>, would also feature some of the era’s most compelling screen presences, including superstars <a href="/design-living/12914/tadanobu-asano-japans-ice-cool-king-of-the-indies-film-japan-zatoichi">Tadanobu Asano</a> and actor-director <a href="/design-living/12671/must-watch-crime-films-by-takeshi-kitano-japan-season-bfi">Takeshi Kitano</a>.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><strong><em>Funeral Parade of Roses</em>, 1969</strong></h2>
<p>As sexual liberation became increasingly visible in the west during the swinging 60s, so too did attitudes towards sex change in Japan. By the end of the decade, both avant-garde arts and a thriving gay scene became prominent in downtown Shinjuku, in the sprawling capital of Tokyo.</p>
<p>In the opening of this audacious work, the saturated white skin of a naked male torso is captured in extreme close-up. “I am the wound and the blade, both the torturer and he who is flayed,” reads the on-screen text, as a topless male fornicates with a stunning transvestite man. This is <em>Funeral Parade of Roses: </em>the most Warhol-esque of the New Wave films on this list, and perhaps the greatest queer film ever to emerge from Japan.</p>
<p>Filmed in a Godard-ian style that fuses chaotic jump cuts with handheld camerawork, <em>Funeral Parade of Roses </em>is the story of Eddie (played by the androgynous icon Peter) – a Shinjuku “gay boy” who revels with his fellow “queens” in the city’s hedonistic gay quarter. It’s a dizzying and experimental journey that combines orgasms and marijuana smoke with psych-rock dance-offs, jumping from snapshots of naked bums spouting blooming flowers to stabbings and Buñuel-esque eye gouges. </p>
<p>With a cast largely built of real amateurs from the gay scene, it also deliberately melds narrative fiction with jarring documentary realism – as transvestites rocking Yayoi Kusama-style wigs break the fourth wall to answer questions like “How long have you been gay?” and “How long have you been a queen?” Today, the film is considered an avant-garde classic, with parallels observed in everything from noted fan Stanley Kubrick’s <em>A Clockwork Orange, </em>to <a href="/design-living/12873/the-gentle-human-dramas-of-hirokazu-kore-eda-after-life-shoplifters">Hirokazu Kore-eda</a>’s <em>After Life, </em>and Jennie Livingston’s <em>Paris Is Burning. </em>It returns to the BFI Player this month alongside cinema screenings in Southbank.</p>

<p>For German image-maker <strong>Florian Hetz</strong>, photography is much more than just a career. A few years ago, completely burnt out from working seven day weeks in TV production, he fell gravely ill with encephalitis – an inflammation of the brain which caused him to lose vast chunks of his memory. Picking up the pieces in the wake of this ordeal, the camera became an unexpected and vital lifeline. “My whole brain basically got fried,” he tells AnOther. “But that’s how I started to take photos. I realised if I take little photos – of daily situations, of people, of people’s hands, of a cup or a shoe – I could remember.”</p>
<p>Hetz’s illness was a catalyst for a drastic change in his lifestyle, forcing him to learn how to live life anew. “I got out of the hospital and cancelled my whole career,” he remembers. “It sounds always stupid when I say it, but it was the best thing that could have happened to me. Most people are really good at this; they grow up being mindful. I needed this really harsh reality check.” For the self-proclaimed “workaholic”, it’s meant a rebirth into a gentler, more fulfilling way of life.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Working at the notorious Berlin nightclub Berghain on the weekends to cover rent, Hetz’s love of photography naturally blossomed over these slower, explorative next few years, in which he published two monographs, <em>The Matter of Absence</em> (2016) and<em> ZWEI</em> (2020). His latest book <a href="https://www.paperaffairs.com/shop-our-books/florianhetz-aiko"><em>AIKO</em></a> is a poignant and deeply personal work, which sees Hetz return to the practice of daily photo journaling. This time, he was documenting 2020 – a period marked by struggle for so many, not least of all for the photographer, who sadly lost his father.</p>
<p>“To put it really simply, it’s my year, my 2020,” says Hetz. “It’s an introduction of these daily observations, I would call them. Since the hospital, I always carry a tiny little camera in my left pocket, and the new book is taken more or less 70 per cent with this little camera.” </p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Encompassing street photography, still lifes and sensual nude portraiture, the book is structured in a series of rhyming pairs – where a blue doctor’s glove matches the blue graffiti on concrete wall, or a peeled and half-eaten grapefruit the gentle curve of a naked back. Exploring themes of “letting go, acceptance and hope,” Hetz stresses the book is not a sad one, even though it documents a difficult time. </p>
<p>“It’s not sad,” he says. “The book is not about death in that sense, though part of it is. In a way it’s a little bit of a tribute to my dad … There are these little moments of beauty. There’s a photo in the book where the sun is just hitting a pair of hands. And it’s this moment in spring when the first light comes, and your whole body is yearning for that summer. We all want to go out, you see all these people on the street staring in the sun. It’s about that – these little moments that, for me at least, give me hope.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>For Hetz, an intensely private person by nature, he hopes the book offers an invitation to enjoy these glimmers of beauty in daily life. “I hope it’s an invitation into my world and my way of seeing things,” he says. “If someone can look at it and see these little things, appreciate the little things that I appreciate, then I think it’s already a big step for me.”</p>

<p>When we first meet Emi, the protagonist of <strong><em>Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn</em></strong>, she is at her most exposed – in all senses of the word. In the wince-inducing opening sequence, we see her sex tape with her husband (played by adult-film actor Ştefan Steel) unfold against jeering music and mock-grave title cards. Though the fate of this video is at the core of Radu Jude’s latest film, the director explains, “much more important was what was behind the story than the story itself.”</p>
<p><em>Bad Luck Banging or Loony Porn</em>, inspired by the rule-breakers of the French New Wave, is a film that resists falling neatly into any category. Steering clear of traditional plotlines, the film is broken into three parts: in the first, teacher Emi (Katia Pascariu) deals with the fallout of the sex tape being leaked online; in the second, archival material and fragmentary footage is spliced together with reimagined dictionary definitions; and, in the third, Emi is at the centre of a farcical trial in which parents of students vote on whether she keeps her job. “It started with a real news event,” Jude explains. “It seemed not a good story in itself, but a good story from which to analyse what is behind or what is around these images. It’s a film not about a porn video but all the connections between this with other things like morality, obscenity, body versus politics, freedom and society.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="TZMAAYy7GQY"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZMAAYy7GQY" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>While plans were in place to shoot the first part in a documentary style, by the time filming was due to begin, Romania was in the thick of lockdown. Masks are worn throughout and, as Emi drifts through Bucharest’s streets, <em>Bad Luck Banging</em> captures the bizarreness of the pandemic world. Petty arguments erupt between strangers, shoppers fret over the state of government, and an advertisement for Covid-19 tests is emblazoned with the slogan: “I like it deep”. Jude explains the reasoning behind the documentary aesthetic: “I made a few films using history before and then eventually I decided to make a film about contemporary life in Romania. But with the case of the teacher, I wanted to concentrate on it as already existing as a historical object.”</p>
<p>Filming in the pandemic was not without its challenges. “I wanted to protect the actors as much as possible, so we did all our rehearsals on Zoom. Generally, you don’t have control of timing, of volumes, and of course any blocking. It was also difficult because of the delay: when you have a Zoom with 20 or 30 actors, some have a delay of 50 seconds.”</p>
<p>Modelled on the three-part structure of Hermann Broch’s novel <em>The Sleepwalkers</em> – which provided the original title for the film – <em>Bad Luck Banging </em>aims for a prosaic, sketch-like style. Three years of foraging for quotes and observations culminated in the dictionary montage section of the film, where Jude’s trademark dark humour is given full reign. Cinema is also proposed as a tool for revealing true profanity, since without it “we do not and cannot see actual horrors”.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>The film, like his others, spotlights the obscene antisemitism and racism that still blights Romanian society. “I’m not Jewish but I belong to a generation that tried to understand what happened in Romania historically – what is historical and what is not – because a nation is always built on an image of its own history,” Jude says. “After the revolution, when I was a teenager, I wanted to know what our real history was and what was behind all this propaganda that we were living in.”</p>
<p>Misogyny is also rife, which Pascariu expertly portrays through the trial of the unshakeable Emi. “She’s acted in a lot of political-feminist-social-educational theatre. I knew her from casting sessions from my previous films, and always admired and wanted to work with her. This film was somehow written with her in mind. After I finished it, I sent it to her and said: I don’t want a casting session, I just want you to play it. That was it. It was a perfect collaboration.”</p>
<p>Though Emi is on trial, it is the ugliness of her parents’ views that is ultimately laid bare. In the film, younger generations are shown to bear the brunt of these polarised opinions, with children redefined as “political prisoners” of their parents. “The educational system is a mess all over the world and in Romania especially,” says Jude. “It’s classist, it’s underfunded, it’s badly organised, it’s really a crime what happens in the Romanian education system. 25 per cent of Romanian children abandon school.” On whether he hopes <em>Bad Luck Banging</em> will do anything to counter this, he is cynical: “A film cannot change anything, it can just show a bit of the problem. It’s politicians who can change, it’s society that can change. But it’s not happening.”</p>

<p>2021 was a breakthrough year for <strong>Iris Law</strong>. The actress, model and Dior Beauty ambassador has spent the last 12 months securing her status as an emerging supernova – winning a role in Danny Boyle’s upcoming Sex Pistols biopic, as well as a slew of exciting new modelling contracts. On top of all that, somehow, Law has been balancing full workdays at Central Saint Martins, where she is currently studying for a degree in Experimental Textile Design (when we speak, she is on campus, sneaking in some time between lectures).</p>
<p>This bold new era was symbolically marked by Law at the start of the year. In a shock move, the 21-year-old decided to break from conventional beauty standards, swapping her flowing English Rose mane for a bleached buzzcut. It’s an expressive, anarchic approach to beauty that Law is hoping to cultivate further in the years to come. Here, she tells us more about how it’s developing – from the products that she could never be without, to the everyday rituals that keep her grounded.</p>
<p><strong>AnOther Magazine: Tell us about your morning beauty routine.</strong></p>
<p>Iris Law: I always use a jade roller on my face, every morning. I’m also obsessed with the <a href="https://www.dior.com/en_gb/products/beauty-Y0996166_C099600562?gclid=CjwKCAiA4veMBhAMEiwAU4XRr_TtEMg9Cfb1BWxGpbgacXakkCyF6rE1JLGw5MSPh5GgdpDhJiWFFRoCwfgQAvD_BwE">Dior Prestige Rose Advanced Serum</a>: it’s pink and it smells so good. You know one of those products that you’re so obsessed with that you can’t stop recommending it? I just love it so much. So I use that, and then use the <a href="https://www.dior.com/en_gb/products/beauty-Y0996293-dior-prestige-le-baume-demaquillant-exceptional-cleansing-balm-to-oil?objectID=Y0996293query=dior%20prestigequeryID=dc9842787f34b2c71e2afe53ed14ad1c">Dior Prestige Le Baume Demaquillant</a> cleanser morning and night. And if I have a shoot that day, I’ll use their <a href="https://www.dior.com/en_gb/products/beauty-Y0690530-dior-hydra-life-glow-better-fresh-jelly-mask?objectID=Y0690530query=hydra%20life%20maskqueryID=89fdfbefb7b6ce98819026258d61820e">Hydra Life Glow Better Fresh Jelly Mask</a>, which is an exfoliant mask that makes your skin really smooth and ready for makeup.</p>
<p><strong>AM: Do you wear makeup every day?</strong></p>
<p>IL: No, I rarely wear makeup. If I’m not working, I’m probably not wearing makeup. I sometimes wear lipstick or a lip stain which I might put on a couple of times in the day, but I usually just have it in my bag. </p>
<p><strong>AM: How has your beauty routine changed as you’ve got older? Have you started taking it more seriously?</strong></p>
<p>IL: I used to be super expressive with my makeup – like wearing blusher high on the cheekbone, as opposed to low – but then as my skin got worse, I just started focusing on coverage. But when you have high coverage, it really takes out the shape of your face, and you have to go back in with blush and contour to try and make it look normal again. So that got really distracting, and I just didn’t feel confident with trying new things. But now, since my skin got better and I shaved my head, I’ve got a lot more expressive with my makeup. I’m addicted to eyeshadow. </p><blockquote>
<p>“I struggle with anxiety – or I did, more so – and it’s just really important to find things that make you feel like you’re taking back some control” – Iris Law</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>AM: How have you felt since shaving your head?</strong></p>
<p>IL: I cut my hair at a time where so much was changing in my life. I was moving out of my home, filming a TV show and acting for the first time, and coming out of lockdown. I was just pushing a lot of boundaries for myself. And [with a shaved head], you can’t hide behind your hair anymore – it changes your look so drastically. It just pushed me to just really look at how I wanted to express myself. It felt really empowering.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What about outside of physical beauty products – what are your wellness rituals? How do you feel good mentally?</strong></p>
<p>IL: I want to get to the end of the day knowing that I’ve given myself a good amount of nutrition. I take so many supplements and vitamins and drink lots of water. I have green juice powders and probiotics that I put in my water too, and I have a tea routine. I have all these different types of teas; like 10 teas, all for different times of day. Some with dried rose flowers or chamomile; some with echinacea ...</p>
<p><strong>AM: Do they make a noticeable difference for you?</strong></p>
<p>IL: I struggle with anxiety – or I did, more so – and it’s just really important to find things that make you feel like you’re taking back some control. It’s the same with essential oils and my diffuser: you can get all these different types of essential oils, and maybe it might be placebo, but it just like feels like you’re caring for yourself and figuring out how you feel at that time and what might help. Some oils help with hormones, like clary sage. Or if you need to breathe, there’s peppermint or rose or orange. It just helps you feel like you’re checking in with yourself.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>AM: So what’s your favourite essential oil at the moment?</strong></p>
<p>IL: Orange is my favourite essential oil; orange rind. It’s really uplifting, and you can put it in the bath as well as on your palm or wrists, and your pulse points.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What about tea? What tea would you recommend?</strong></p>
<p>IL: My favourite tea at the moment is Milk Oolong. There’s no milk or dairy in it, but it tastes really creamy. They grow it up in the mountains, at a specific height, and something about that type of air makes it taste [like milk].</p>
<p><strong>AM: What about when you do feel anxious, or when you feel like you’ve lost a bit of confidence? How do you cope on those days? </strong></p>
<p>IL: I just never push myself. I started feeling super anxious the other day because everything was getting on top of me with work. I had 20 minutes until the end of the day, but I just decided to leave. I took the evening to myself and didn’t do more work – even though technically I was on a deadline and should have done – but you need to just let yourself have a moment. Otherwise, if you overpush yourself, then the [quality of your work suffers]. So I think I’m good at saying “no, you need to chill”.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What about your personal wellbeing goals for 2022 – is there anything that you want to improve or work on?</strong></p>
<p>IL: I feel like I’m in such a good place with my health, my sleep routine, my food routine, and my work routine. So I don’t know – maybe I’d like to go running more. I feel like I’m on a good road. I just need to continue working.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">
