<p><strong>It&#x2019;s been more than 100 days since a rat has been officially detected on Lord Howe Island. But eradicating its rodent refugees is just one chapter in the conservation story of this remote wilderness area, Sarah Reid discovers</strong>.</p>



<p>Peering around the tangled roots of an ancient banyan tree, I discover the source of the high-pitched staccato squeaks dominating the rainforest soundtrack: two fluffy brown Lord Howe woodhen chicks, right beside the trail. They must be hungry, as the pair of bantam-sized flightless birds busily foraging for insects on the forest floor nearby&#x2014;likely the chicks&#x2019; parents, which pair for life&#x2014;don&#x2019;t seem to be bothered by my presence.<br><br>Less than an hour after arriving on Lord Howe Island, a seven-million-year-old crescent of land cradling an idyllic turquoise lagoon some 600 kilometers off the coast of New South Wales, I&#x2019;d witnessed what would have been a rare sight just a few years ago.</p>

        <p>Despite opposition from some locals that divided the small island community, the AUD$17million project&#x2014;the largest ever attempted on an inhabited island&#x2014;has been a boon for the island&#x2019;s biodiversity, says Ian Hutton, naturalist and curator of Lord Howe&#x2019;s excellent museum.</p>
<p>&#x201C;We didn&#x2019;t expect the woodhen population to increase so quickly,&#x201D; said Hutton, noting that numbers are thought to have tripled since the release of 230 individuals back onto the island in early 2020. But it&#x2019;s not the only species flourishing.</p>

        <p>Over a Lord Howe Island Distilling Co. gin at lagoon-side bar, The Crooked Post, owner Tim Cruikshank pointed out a colony of noddy terns that only recently began nesting in the surrounding Norfolk pines. A raft of more subtle ecological changes have also been observed by locals including sixth-generation islander Anthony Riddle, a tour operator and co-founder of the local gin company.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I&#x2019;ve never seen so many butterflies,&#x201D; Riddle told me during a glass-bottom boat tour of the turtle hangouts in the island&#x2019;s lagoon. &#x201C;Some species I&#x2019;ve never seen on the island before.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>By early 2021, it seemed like Lord Howe&#x2019;s rat problem had been solved. Then, in April, came devastating news. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/apr/19/rats-reappear-on-lord-howe-island-for-the-first-time-since-2019-eradication-program">A pair of rats</a> was spotted. The female was pregnant.</p>
<p>Rangers snapped back into action, re-baiting traps and ramping up dog detection patrols. Within the next three months, 96 rodents had been removed.</p>

<p>While it may be some time yet before the Lord Howe Island Board is confident in declaring the island rodent-free, this is a glorious era to visit this New South Wales outpost, where accessing the island&#x2019;s beaches now requires dodging dozens of sooty tern nests, and curious woodhens seem to pop out from behind every corner. The shrill calls of nesting flesh-footed shearwaters (locally known as muttonbirds) echo throughout the Kentia palm forest behind Ned&#x2019;s Beach each evening during my visit, and metallic beetles light up rainforest trails.</p>

However the mid-20th-century extinction of its natural predator, the Lord Howe boobook owl, has created a complication that could take scientists years to unravel.</p>

Bicycles are the main form of transport on the 14.55&#xA0;square-kilometer island, and guest rooms don&#x2019;t come with keys. There&#x2019;s no mobile (cell) service, and only limited wi-fi.</p>
<p>While traditional luxury seekers will find it at top boutique stays such as Capella and Island House, the greatest luxury is the opportunity to visit a natural wonder that hasn&#x2019;t changed much since Lord Howe was first settled in 1834. But this otherworldly isle is arguably facing an even greater challenge than its rat problem.</p>
<p>Having moved to Lord Howe as a weather man in 1980 and never left, Hutton has kept a close eye on climatic changes. &#x201C;The average daily temperature has been steadily increasing while the rainfall has been steadily declining, which is concerning,&#x201D; Hutton explained on a tour of the museum, where a climate change display features images of dying rainforest trees and bleached corals caused by extreme weather in recent years.</p>

        <p>At particular risk of climate change impacts is the <a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=20263">Gnarled Mossy Cloud Forest</a> atop Mt Gower, the 875-meter-high hulk of basalt at the island&#x2019;s southern end&#x2014;a misty mountain oasis of rare palms and twisted rainforest trees dripping with frilly lichens, neon mosses and delicate orchids.</p>
<p>Ascending Mt Gower with guide Dean Hiscox of <a href="https://lordhoweislandtours.com/">Lord Howe Environmental Tours</a>, it&#x2019;s like hiking into a fairy tale&#x2014;of the Grimm&#x2019;s variety. On the summit plateau, Hiscox, who worked as a Lord Howe Island Board Ranger&#xA0;for 16 years before launching his ecotourism business, shows me a large opening in the canopy created by a cluster of dead and dying rainforest trees. Now exposed to direct sunlight typically filtered by the canopy, many surrounding plants also look sickly.</p>
<p>&#x201C;This has never been recorded in the human history of Lord Howe,&#x201D; says Hiscox, whose wife Roslyn hails from one of the island&#x2019;s founding families. &#x201C;Now we&#x2019;re seeing such dramatic changes so quickly, there&#x2019;s a risk that we could lose this forest really soon. And this is the only place like it in the world.&#x201D; Indeed, the critically endangered ecosystem is home to <a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/threatenedspeciesapp/profile.aspx?id=20263">86 per cent</a> of the island&#x2019;s endemic plant species.</p>

    <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end">

<p><strong>How has the pandemic changed the soundscape in our cities? And how does what we hear affect our wellbeing? Here&#x2019;s what the University of Sydney&#x2019;s <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/kurt-iveson-1223">Kurt Iveson</a>, Associate Professor of Urban Geography and Research Lead, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/dieter-hochuli-135191">Dieter Hochuli</a>, Professor at the School of Life and Environmental Sciences have been finding out.</strong><br><br>The dull roar of traffic, the barking of dogs in backyards and the screeching of cockatoos at dusk. The shattering of early morning quiet by the first plane overhead or the garbage truck on its rounds. The squealed delights and occasional fights of a children&#x2019;s playground.</p>



<p>These sounds and many more create what Canadian composer R Murray Schafer famously called a &#x201C;<a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Soundscape/R-Murray-Schafer/9780892814558">soundscape</a>&#x201D;. Schafer, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/arts/music/r-murray-schafer-dead.html">passed away last month</a>, helped us realise we experience cities with our ears as well as our eyes.</p>



<p>In recent years, studies have confirmed these soundscapes <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17020393">affect the well-being of urban inhabitants</a> &#x2014; both human and non-human. But with much of the country back under lockdown, urban soundscapes have changed, sometimes bringing delight, but sometimes causing new distress.</p>



<p>So let&#x2019;s take a moment to consider how soundscapes influence our lives, and the lives of urban wildlife.</p>



<h2>When sounds become &#x2018;noise&#x2019;</h2>



<p>Whether it&#x2019;s housemates, traffic, or construction, we tend to respond to many urban sounds by defining them as &#x201C;noise&#x201D;, and try to shut them out. We do this using a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40726-018-0095-7">range of techniques and technologies</a>: building regulations on soundproofing, controls on the times for certain activities like construction, and planning measures.</p>



<p>But noise mapping efforts show <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40726-018-0095-7">such regulations tend to produce uneven urban soundscapes</a> &#x2014; some people are more exposed to loud or annoying sounds than others.</p>



<p>Housing quality is a major factor here, and noise problems are likely exacerbated under lockdown. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/19491247.2021.1940686">recent study of pandemic housing inequality in Sydney</a> found increased exposure to noise during lockdown is significantly contributing to poor well-being.</p>



<p>For example, sounds travelling across internal and external walls <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-is-why-apartment-living-is-different-for-the-poor-82069">of apartments</a> were frequently a source of tension in pre-pandemic times. Now, with so many more people spending more time at home, these domestic sounds inevitably increase.</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s not just humans whose lives are disrupted by city noise, as many animals use sound to communicate.</p>



<p>The ever-vigilant New Holland honeyeaters of Australian cities <a href="https://soundcloud.com/alziell/the-aerial-hawkalarm-call-of-a-new-holland-honeyeater-bigic">use their alarm calls</a> to warn their friends and neighbours of danger, while the <a href="https://theconversation.com/clicks-bonks-and-dripping-taps-listen-to-the-calls-of-6-frogs-out-and-about-this-summer-150084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iconic chorus of banjo frogs</a> in wetlands are the hopeful calls of males seeking mates. This is the sound <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PscvK2xs8t8?wmode=transparent&amp;start=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a banjo frog makes</a>.</p>



<p>Noisy environments can dramatically change <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-noise-pollution-is-changing-animal-behaviour-52339">how these animals behave</a>. In some cases, animals adapt to their noisy environment. Some frogs, for example, overcome traffic noise disrupting their sex lives by <a href="https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol14/iss1/art25/">calling at a higher pitch</a>. Likewise, populations of bow-winged grasshoppers in Germany exposed to road noise <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2435.12215">sing at higher frequencies</a> than those living in quieter areas.</p>



<p>For other animals, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749119365546">such as microbats in England</a>, disruptive noise changes how they forage and move around their environments.<br><br>In extreme cases, these human-associated noises can drive animals away from their homes, as the disruptions to their lives becomes untenable.</p>



<p><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0529">Urban black-tufted marmosets in Brazil</a> have been shown to avoid areas with abundant food where noise may interfere with their vocal communication. And research shows intruding noise in <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2290">stopovers for migratory birds in the United States</a> reduces their diversity by 25%, with some species avoiding the stopovers altogether.</p>



<h2>A new quiet?</h2>



<p>The soundscape of cities in lockdown <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-is-what-lockdown-sounds-like-153590">can be dramatically different from</a> what we have come to accept as normal.</p>



<p>First, there are new noises. For example, in Sydney&#x2019;s areas of concern subject to tighter lockdown restrictions, people are living with the frequent intrusive noise of police helicopters patrolling their neighbourhoods, making announcements over loudspeakers about compliance.</p>



<p>But in other cases, as our movements and activities are restricted, some city sounds associated with a negative impact on well-being are <a href="https://theconversation.com/this-is-what-lockdown-sounds-like-153590">significantly reduced</a>. People who live near major roads, aircraft flight paths, or construction sites will certainly be noticing the quiet as road traffic is greatly reduced and non-essential construction is paused.</p>



<p>But of course, while this silence might be golden for some, for others the sound of silence is the sound of lost work and income. This quietude may even be considered as unwelcome or even eerie &#x2014; the sonic signature of isolation, confinement and loss.</p>



<p>Just as many animals adapt to or avoid noisy urban environments, there is a chance many will respond to this <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02092-7">natural experiment playing out</a>. Quieter urban environments may see the return of some of our more noise sensitive species, but this depends on the species.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2011.0529">Brazilian marmosets mentioned earlier</a> didn&#x2019;t return to those locations even during quieter times, suggesting the noise left a disruptive legacy on their habitat choice, well after it was experienced. On the other hand, other experiments show <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.2290">some species of birds</a> rapidly returned to sites after noise was removed from the landscape.<br><br>While it&#x2019;s too early to confirm any <a href="https://theconversation.com/where-the-wild-things-are-how-nature-might-respond-as-coronavirus-keeps-humans-indoors-134543">early speculation</a> about nature returning to quieter urban environments during lockdown, there is compelling evidence many people will <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23748834.2020.1795385">benefit from engaging with local nature</a> more actively than they did before</p>



<p>Many more Australians are acting as <a href="https://www.urbanfieldnaturalist.org/">urban field naturalists</a>. Birdwatching, for example, <a href="https://theconversation.com/birdwatching-increased-tenfold-last-lockdown-dont-stop-its-a-huge-help-for-bushfire-recovery-141970">increased tenfold</a> in lockdown last year.</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s clear people are seeing novelty and wonder in animals and plants that have survived and even thrived in our cities right beneath our noses the whole time. Our <a href="https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/pan3.10218">increased use of local greenspace</a> during the pandemic has created new opportunities to find the extraordinary in the ordinary.</p>



<h2>Rethinking post-pandemic soundscapes</h2>



<p>What might we learn from this natural experiment about the soundscapes we take for granted and the soundscapes we actually want?</p>



<p>This is an invitation to think about whether we ought to do more to control sounds we consider &#x201C;noise&#x201D;. Yes, decibel levels of activities like car and air traffic matter. But it&#x2019;s also <a href="https://apo.org.au/node/178696">an opportunity to think beyond controlling sounds</a>, and consider how we might create soundscapes to enhance human and non-human well-being. This is easier said than done, given there&#x2019;s no universal measure of what sounds give pleasure and what sounds are perceived as noise.</p>



<p>This aligns with the <a href="https://environmentalevidencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13750-020-00202-y">growing body of evidence</a> on the need to reduce noise pollution and protect biodiversity when planning and managing our cities.</p>



<p>Like just about every other dimension of urban life, envisioning and creating an improved urban soundscape requires <a href="https://www.redglobepress.com//page/detail/Planning-and-Diversity-in-the-City/?K=9781403938107">careful attention</a> to spatial inequality and diversity &#x2013; including of species &#x2013; and a capacity to work through our differences in a fair and just way.</p>

<p><strong>With sales of e-bikes soaring, and previously inaccessible off-road spots now easier for casual riders to access, Jim Cherrington, Senior Lecturer of Sport Sociology at Sheffield Hallam University, dives into the pros and cons. </strong></p>



<p>Sales of electric bikes have increased dramatically recently. In 2020, 4.6 million e-bikes were sold in the EU and UK, a <a href="https://cyclingindustry.news/european-cycling-market-now-worth-e18-3bn-localised-e-bike-production-hits-80/#:%7E:text=E%2DBike%20sales%20leapt%20to,that%20has%20been%20gathering%20pace.">52% rise</a> year on year. In the UK, nearly one in three adult bikes sold are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/08/electric-bike-and-scooter-sales-boom-pushes-halford-back-to-growth-covid-19">now electric</a>.</p>



<p>But they are also the subject of much controversy, as e-bikes allow riders to go much further and faster in the countryside. This has led to an intense debate between cyclists, horse riders and walkers about what constitutes acceptable levels of <a href="https://www.imba.com/press-release/early-data-released-impacts-emtb-use-trails">speed, noise and erosion</a> from this new technology.</p>



<p>Indeed, on social networking sites and various internet forums, there is also a widespread perception that e-mountain bike riders are <a href="https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-columns/over-a-beer-why-ebikes-are-the-spawn-of-satan-mostly/">selfish, lazy and anti-social</a>. These riders are also accused of being overly reliant on the motor and of travelling at speeds that are unsafe for other users of the countryside &#x2013; which is said to result in damage to biking trails and the wider environment.</p>



<h2>Environmental implications</h2>



<p>The introduction of a motor and a battery to an all-terrain bicycle may create the potential for many more cyclists to access the great outdoors. But the heavier components, wider tyres and added torque raise <a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/outdoors/a470260/are-electric-mountain-bikes-legal/">concern among</a> many riders about the potential environmental impact.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02604027.2019.1698234">Our research</a> shows that traditional mountain-biking involves a <a href="https://theconversation.com/mountain-bikers-can-strengthen-the-connection-between-humans-nature-and-recreational-space-137206">complex relationship</a> between riders, bikes and terrain. Through careful experimentation and progression, riders learn to be attentive to the limits and abilities of their body and their bike. And in doing so, they gain a deep appreciation for both the feel of the trail and the topography of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213078016300391">the landscape</a>.</p>



<p>This has been shown to influence their encounters with other user groups, as mountain bikers make concessions for walkers and horse riders based on a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718514000955">mutual understanding</a> of the terrain. Riders will often give way to walkers travelling uphill and may choose to wait before passing horses on rugged trails to avoid dislodging objects that may strike or startle the animal.</p>



<p>The fear with e-bikes is that the addition of a motor makes users complacent about the demands of the terrain, and the needs of other people &#x2013; with riders prioritising getting uphill as quickly as possible, or going as far as they can on a single battery.</p>



<p>But while a lot of these fears and complaints may well be valid, most are based on anecdotal evidence rather than any actual research. So as part of our <a href="https://www.ridesheffield.org.uk/sheffield-hallam-university-e-bike-study-volunteers-wanted/">latest project</a>, that hasn&#x2019;t yet been published, we&#x2019;ve spoken with 30 e-bike riders in England to find out more about why people choose e-bikes and how they actually ride them. What our findings indicate so far is that electric mountain bike users are often more responsible than perceptions might suggest.</p>



<h2>The benefits</h2>



<p>Participants we have spoken to so far have told us how they constantly ask other (non-e-bike) riders how tired they are or how difficult the terrain is to ride, to accommodate the pace and energy levels of the group.</p>



<p>When cycling with non-e-bikers, participants also told us that they position themselves at the back to avoid &#x201C;rubbing other people&#x2019;s noses in it&#x201D;, while some have said that they have swapped bikes with others when they are too tired to go on.</p>



<p>E-bikes also seem to have a wider social role in relation to crime, ill-health and social exclusion. One participant &#x2013; a disabled former soldier &#x2013; said his e-bike has been the springboard for a new social enterprise that tackles youth offending through cycling. We&#x2019;ve also heard from several older participants who said purchasing an e-bike has led to vast improvements in their physical and mental well-being.</p>



<h2>Risks and gains</h2>



<p>On the other hand, we&#x2019;ve also had reports of riders barging through groups of walkers. And one of our participants, who works in the bike industry, was aware of two instances where e-mountain bike riders had gone too far into the wilderness, run out of battery, and needed to call the air ambulance.</p>



<p>This concern is further illustrated by some of the riders&#x2019; relationships with the battery and on-board computer. Even though our research is still ongoing, numerous participants have described how the Bluetooth link between their bikes and GPS tracking apps such as Strava allowed them to &#x201C;compete&#x201D; more effectively against their friends.</p>



<p>These are isolated incidents, but they reinforce <a href="https://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/210443/?isxn=9781522543480">existing studies</a> that illustrate how tracking devices can be enrolled with other forms of technology in sport and physical activity to enable immoral, disrespectful and irresponsible forms of behaviour. The use of Strava to encourage fast and competitive riding has <a href="https://enduro-mtb.com/en/strava-opinion/">also been linked</a> with increased trail damage and surface erosion.</p>



<p>To quote the popular mountain bike commentator Rob Warner, &#x201C;electric mountain bikes represent the most significant thing to happen to mountain biking since mountain biking&#x201D;. They allow people to overcome a range of social and physical barriers and engage in more outdoor exercise.</p>



<p>But questions remain as to whether the risk to the environment outweighs the potential gains for culture, health and society. <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/mtbleadership/article/20210429-mtb-leadership-news-Major-new-research-project-launched--into-E-mountain-bike-use-in-Britain-0">More research</a> is needed to ensure that future conversations are informed by evidence, rather than anecdotes.</p>

<p><strong>For Milanese chef Cesare Battisti, protecting the tradition and legacy of the region&#x2019;s risotto is something he takes very, very seriously. Rome-based reporter Silvia Marchetti investigates. </strong></p>



<p>How many times have you had risotto? Chances are, it was a counterfeit. Because the one and only <em>real</em> risotto is made in Milan and the Milanese affectionately call it r<em>isotto alla milanese&#xA0;(</em>cooked the Milanese-way<em>)</em> or&#xA0;<em>risotto allo zafferano</em> (cooked with saffron). In local dialect, it&#x2019;s simply <em>risott giad</em> (aka &#x2018;yellow rice&#x2019;).</p>



<p>They&#x2019;re all the same thing. Essentially, a plateful of locally grown rice cooked with a few key ingredients including saffron (the spice that gives it its distinctive yellow color) and veal or vegetable broth to help the flavors amalgamate and create a creamy, gold-colored risotto with a soft texture.</p>



<p>But watch out. Milan&#x2019;s dining scene is facing a metamorphosis with thousands of fancy concoctions and twists. In order to taste the original recipe in all its glory, there&#x2019;s only one place you should head to: Ratan&#xE0;, the restaurant of chef Cesare Battisti. A chic 1800s Liberty-style villa overlooking a park, it used to be the lair of a shaman priest (who used the building to run a small tavern) back in the 1930s.</p>

        <p>Ratan&#xE0; is cozy and chic, and a place in which the old very much meets the new. The restaurant, which enjoyed another former life as railway storage facility, reflects what Battisti calls &#x201C;industrial archaeology&#x201D;. The tables are made with old melted steel from railway tracks, while the view from the restaurant takes in Milan&#x2019;s futuristic modern skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Ratan&#xE0; is the temple of <em>risotto alla milanese</em>, and locals who are crazy for this iconic dish flock here. Battisti serves it old-style: With bone marrow, <em>gremolata</em> (a lemon zest, parsley and garlic sauce) and roasted meat sauce. He also makes risotto with <em>ossobuco</em>; that&#x2019;s risotto served with a succulent braised veal shank placed on top that enhances the flavor and melts in the mouth.</p>

<p><em>Ossobuco</em> is a delicious, ancient ingredient that was ditched in the early 1900s as it was considered too greasy and subsequently substituted with &#x2018;lighter&#x2019; ones such as extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese.</p>
<p>&#x201C;At the beginning, risotto was made with a simple broth. Bone marrow was added at a later stage when families could afford a more nutritive, expensive meal,&#x201D; says Battisti. &#x201C;Then healthy habits kicked in, vegetable broth and so on, but I still like to add <em>ossobuco</em>. It&#x2019;s my signature.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>Milan born-and-bred, Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine. When it comes to traditions, he&#x2019;s dead serious about protecting his ancestors&#x2019; legacy. &#x201C;Risotto is sacrosanct, it&#x2019;s embedded in the Milanese soul,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;We eat it year-round so we&#x2019;re quite fittingly called <em>risottari</em> [&#x2018;those who eat risotto&#x2019;], and that&#x2019;s a source of pride.&#x201D;</p>
<p>He believes the roots of <em>risottari </em>are deeply anchored in Milan&#x2019;s culinary heritage and can&#x2019;t be removed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;I was so intrigued by the stories on how risotto came to be that I wanted to draw a line between legend and history.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2013; Cesare Battisti</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#x201C;Old-style risotto can only be made in a specific way, and that way hasn&#x2019;t changed across centuries,&#x201D; Battisti explains. &#x201C;Peasants, bourgeois and aristocrats have been handing down the recipe across generations. Michelin-starred experiments are mere culinary pornography. Those chefs see their own ego reflected in their dishes. Their cooking is a narcissistic, snob act meant to confuse and intimidate eaters.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Considered an authority when it comes to risotto, Battisti is down-to-earth but can be provocative. Fueled by a passion for Milan&#x2019;s culinary history, he embarked on an academic quest to trace the real origins of risotto.</p>

        <p>The chef-turned-scholar made a unique discovery, which he was savvy enough to turn into a fascinating tale for his diners&#x2014;and which he is happy to share with me. &#x201C;I was so intrigued by the stories on how risotto came to be,&#x201D; he tells me, &#x201C;that I wanted to draw a line between legend and history.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Stuck for days inside Milan&#x2019;s historic Ambrosian Library, which dates back to 1607 and where dozens of old manuscripts are cherished, he turned into a bookworm, eventually finding a document that detailed a lavish Renaissance banquet. &#x201C;During a feast at the court of Milan&#x2019;s Sforza rulers, a Flemish glass artist called Valerio di Fiandra came up with a peculiar yellow rice which he served to the guests and hosts,&#x201D; Battisti says. &#x201C;It was a success.&#x201D;</p>

<p>As for most sublime Italian recipes, risotto was the product of imagination and creativity, he adds.&#xA0; &#x201C;The artist had been commissioned to paint certain yellow glass windows of the Duomo cathedral. Back then, groups of painters were divided by color: There was the blue team, the green, red and so on. Valerio led the yellow team, and saffron was used to create the color yellow. He saw the white rice as a blank canvas to paint.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Exotic spices were all the rage during the Renaissance and used to paint garments, carpets and curtains. So why not risotto? And so, to impress the diners at the banquet, the painter sprinkled some saffron powder on the rice, transforming it into a fancy, gold-colored dish.</p>

<div>
    <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">
        <p>Thanks to Battisti, I also learned that a type of saffron is now produced in Italy too, cultivated both in the central region of Marche and on the island of Sardinia, where entire meadows are dotted red. According to Battisti, Sardinian saffron is the best in the world, thanks to its well-shaped bulbs. Using local ingredients is also key to making a great risotto. Battisti buys only indigenous rice such as Carnaroli, which best absorbs the other flavors. It&#x2019;s grown around Milan, ensuring zero food miles.</p>
<p>The Milanese have a love affair with saffron, which explains why it had to pair well with their risotto. &#x201C;In the past rich families had a knack for adding saffron to food sauces, even to tea, as a remedy against depression,&#x201D; says Battisti. &#x201C;Try old-style risotto, and you&#x2019;ll see what I mean&#x201D;.</p>
<p>According to other origin tales (based less on historical facts, says Battisti), the saffron addition was either a joke or a mistake. A painter colleague of Valerio might have added the spice to his rice meal at lunch break, or Valerio himself accidentally dropped the saffron into his dish&#x2014;and then marveled at the taste.</p>
<p>Regardless, Battisti is proud of the discovery he made at L&#x2019;Ambrosiana and believes it supports his culinary doctrine that <em>risotto alla milanese</em> is the perfect balance between innovation and tradition.</p>

<p><strong>Launched during the first week of COP26 in November 2021 and <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/programmes/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration/signatories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already attracting over 300 signatories</a>, the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism is the travel industry&#x2019;s boldest move yet towards measurable decarbonization and climate accountability. Louise Southerden reports. </strong></p>



<p>This week, at COP26 in Glasgow, the travel industry made a giant leap towards meaningful climate action by launching the <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration">Glasgow Declaration: a Commitment to a Decade of Tourism Climate Action</a>.</p>



<p>The Declaration itself is a one-page pledge that travel businesses of all kinds, anywhere in the world, can agree to by becoming a signatory. But the Glasgow Declaration isn&#x2019;t <em>just</em> a pledge. Each signatory must deliver a &#x201C;climate action plan&#x201D; within 12 months and publicly report on its progress.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/darrell-wade-glasgow-declaration-cop26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darrell Wade: &#x201C;The travel industry must turn this climate moment into a climate movement&#x201D;</a></strong></p>


<p>At the Declaration&#x2019;s core is a recognition of the &#x201C;increased urgency&#x201D; of climate action in tourism, an industry responsible for an estimated 8 per cent of global emissions, spelled out in one highlighted paragraph:</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><em>&#x201C;We declare our shared commitment to unite all stakeholders in transforming tourism to deliver effective climate action. We support the global commitment to halve emissions by 2030 and reach Net Zero as soon as possible before 2050. We will consistently align our actions with the latest scientific recommendations, so as to ensure our approach remains consistent with a rise of no more than 1.5&#xB0;C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.&#x201D;</em></p>    </article>

Until COP26, almost 380 travel industry businesses had signed up to Tourism Declares.</p>

        <p>The Glasgow Declaration represents a massive ramping up of the Tourism Declares model. It took six months for representatives from Tourism Declares, the Travel Foundation (a UK-based charity), VisitScotland, the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) and the UN Environment Program (UNEP) to fine-tune the wording, with input from more than 30 other tourism organizations (including Planeterra, Women in Travel, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, South Pacific Tourism Organization, Pacific Asia Travel Association and the International Union for Conservation of Nature among others).</p>

<p><strong>As a signatory and launch partner of the historic Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism at COP26, Intrepid Travel co-founder Darrell Wade explains why this moment matters.&#xA0;</strong></p>



<p>Greta is right: the time for &#x201C;blah blah blah&#x201D; is over. The climate crisis is without doubt the issue of our times, and the travel industry, which is responsible for an estimated 8 per cent of global emissions, should be taking its contribution to this crisis very seriously.</p>



<p>For long too long there has been too much talk and too much rhetoric when it comes to climate action&#x2014;whether that&#x2019;s in the travel industry or beyond. There has been action on a variety of fronts, sure. But while offsetting, tree planting, carbon credits and other such solutions have their place, they&#x2019;re ultimately not going to cut it. What the world needs is <em>actual</em> carbon reduction. Fast. And at scale.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/glasgow-declaraton-tourism-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glasgow Declaration explained: Climate action for tourism finally takes the spotlight</a></strong></p>



<p>As an industry we need more measurable action, and we need to be able to hold organizations who claim to be taking climate action to account. We need decarbonization on a massive scale: less greenwashing, more green-doing.</p>



<p>Sustainable travel advocates and industry insiders Jeremy Smith and Alex Narracott had the right idea when they founded <a href="https://www.tourismdeclares.com/">Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency</a> back in 2019. That incredible movement, which was run by volunteers, resulted in close to 400 travel organizations signing up to commit to climate action. It was clear that there was real appetite for change from small to medium sized companies all around the world. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Travel companies have to take action. And show us you mean it: sign this Declaration, and prove you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.</p></blockquote>



<p>But if we&#x2019;re looking to decarbonize as an industry, we need to get the big carbon emitters (think airlines, hotel chains, cruise lines) on board. And we need them to remain on board for the long haul.</p>



<p>That&#x2019;s why the announcement of the Glasgow Declaration: A Commitment to a Decade of Tourism Climate Action at COP26 this week is so important. This industry-changing Declaration is an evolution of Jeremy and Alex&#x2019;s Tourism Declares work (and the work of many other brilliant and committed individuals), except now it has the backing of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), among others.</p>



<p>The Declaration&#x2019;s goals are clearly defined, and we will be able to measure and track signatories&#x2019; progress against their pledges. That framework and accountability is important: this is about action, not talk.</p>

        <p>I have this week signed the Glasgow Declaration as Vice Chair of World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)&#x2014;a role I have held for the past year. Intrepid Travel, the company I co-founded 30 years ago, is also a signatory. The Declaration has two primary goals: the first is to commit signatories to reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, and the second is to commit them to becoming net zero by 2050. And beneath that, there are a number of other clear commitments, like releasing a climate plan within the first 12 months of signing as a way to validate your method towards decarbonization.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/jeremy-smith-glasgow-declaration-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;A landmark moment&#x201D;: Jeremy Smith, co-founder of Tourism Declares, on the significance of the Glasgow Declaration</a></strong></p>
<p>The second initiative to be unveiled at COP26 is the &#x2018;Roadmap to 2050&#x2019;, which has been prepared in conjunction with WTTC members and Accenture. The roadmap is an initiative by the WTTC, and it takes a sector-specific approach to reaching net zero for 2050. There are separate work streams for aviation, hotels, cruise, tour operators and destinations. This work is important, because when an organization comes to us and says: &#x201C;Sorry, that can&#x2019;t be done&#x201D;, we can show them the roadmap and say: &#x201C;Yes it can, and here&#x2019;s how.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On top of that, Intrepid&#x2019;s very own Environmental Impact Specialist, Susanne Etti, in partnership with Tourism Declares, has authored an open-source <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/au/download-our-carbon-measurement-blueprint-for-tour-operators">Carbon Measurement Blueprint for Tour Operators</a>. It&#x2019;s designed to help other tour operators begin to measure their carbon emissions because if they can measure, they can begin to reduce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#x2019;s on us&#x2014;travelers and travel organizations alike&#x2014;to turn this climate moment into a climate movement. The decisions we make matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inconvenient truth, though, is that the travel industry is <em>way</em> behind where it needs to be, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to get our house in order and aligned with Paris obligations and a 1.5 degree world. It&#x2019;s true that some industries&#x2014;like aviation and shipping&#x2014;are harder to decarbonize than others, but one way or another the world will and must decarbonize, or we have no future at all.</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t say this plainly enough, but when it comes to the climate&#x2014;whether the travel industry or any other industry&#x2014;the time for talking is over. We must act now, we must act together, and we must <em>work</em> together if we&#x2019;re going to have a hope in hell of pulling this off. Travel companies have to take action. And show us you mean it: sign this Declaration, and prove you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.</p>
<p>Now this is all obviously very heavy and very serious stuff. But for me, and I think for all of us at Intrepid Travel, and certainly for my co-founder Geoff, this duty of care we feel towards this magnificent planet and all of the creatures on it is a direct result of the many experiences we&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to have all over it. We owe it to one another, and to future generations, to secure a truly sustainable future. And for individual travelers who care about this issue&#x2014;I know there are a lot of you&#x2014;you can now choose to use the services of more than 300 companies that have signed the Glasgow Declaration.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m moving into the final days of COP26 and beyond with a sense of cautious optimism. I think humans are capable of pretty incredible things when backed into a corner (even if it&#x2019;s a corner of their own making), but it&#x2019;s going to take all of us to get this right. It&#x2019;s on us&#x2014;travelers and travel organizations alike&#x2014;to turn this climate moment into a climate movement. The decisions we make matter. And what we do next is going to matter for a very long time to come.</p>

<p><strong>This week at COP26, travel took a stand with the<a href="https://adventure.com/glasgow-declaraton-tourism-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launch of the Glasgow Declaration</a>: A Commitment to a Decade of Tourism Climate Action. Louise Southerden caught up with one of its chief architects, British sustainable tourism writer Jeremy Smith, to get the backstory on this history-making pledge.</strong></p>



<p>It was January 2020 when <a href="https://www.jmcsmith.com/">Jeremy Smith</a> co-founded Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency. Yep, just before COVID-19 slammed on the brakes and made us all stay home for almost two years.</p>



<p>Despite this, or perhaps <em>because</em> of the enforced pause to think about their impacts and align their operations with their values, almost 380 travel companies, organizations and professionals of all kinds, all over the world, signed up to <a href="https://www.tourismdeclares.com/">Tourism Declares</a>.</p>



<p>In real terms, the declaration meant signatories were committed to developing their own &#x201C;climate action plans&#x201D; to reduce their emissions by half by 2030, in line with guidelines set by the UN&#x2019;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>

<p>Now the UN has picked up the climate action ball and is running with it, in the form of the new <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration">Glasgow Declaration</a> launched this week.</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s &#x201C;a landmark moment in our industry&#x2019;s response to the climate emergency,&#x201D; says Jeremy, who has spent the past six months drafting the declaration with representatives from UK-based charity The Travel Foundation, VisitScotland, the UN World Tourism Organization and the UN Environment Program, with input from more than 30 other tourism organizations around the world.</p>



<p>To find out more, we chatted with Jeremy, who is based in southwest France, about sustainable travel, post-pandemic &#x2019;revenge travel&#x2019; and what declaring a climate emergency really means.</p>

        <p><strong>Adventure.com: What does the Glasgow Declaration mean for travelers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Smith</strong>: It&#x2019;s currently hard for travelers to distinguish tourism businesses and destinations who are committed to sustainability from those who are just good at saying they are. Because the Declaration commits signatories to measuring their emissions and reporting on their efforts to reduce them, it will make it much easier to see who is truly walking the talk.</p>
<p>In the long term, over the course of this decade, it will also make it easier to find the most sustainable providers because signatories commit to collaborating with each other and supporting the SMEs and smaller destinations that make up the majority of tourism, which will accelerate their response to the climate emergency.</p>
<p>I think it will also improve the quality of people&#x2019;s experiences. The Declaration is not only focused on direct decarbonization, but also on the role tourism can play in regeneration of ecosystems and communities, which means cleaner water, more flourishing wildlife, and societies with a better quality of life. And that makes for better holidays.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any concerns about the timing of the Glasgow Declaration post-pandemic?&#xA0;A lot of travel businesses will be doing it tough for a while to come, and&#xA0;climate action might not be a priority for them right now.</strong><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p>The longer we leave climate action, the harder it will be. It&#x2019;s better we work to embed climate action into the recovery, than to &#x2019;recover&#x2019; unsustainably then have a bigger hill to climb even more quickly and after more harm is caused in the next few years. The purpose of the Glasgow Declaration is to support our industry, bring them together to collaborate, and share resources, so it&#x2019;s important that this is done together, equitably, now.</p>

        <p><strong>When COVID-19 was declared a health emergency, the world responded immediately. If we&#x2019;re declaring a climate emergency, shouldn&#x2019;t we be aiming for a similarly extreme response to the climate crisis? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, 100 per cent. We should be responding with the urgency that the US responded with after it was bombed at Pearl Harbor. If your house is on fire, you don&#x2019;t sit down and draw up plans for an extension; you pour water all over it as fast as possible and get your mates and neighbors and the fire engines around and so on. The difficulty is that the climate emergency is incredibly complicated.</p>
<p>One of the reasons we created Tourism Declares was a frustration&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a mild word, but let&#x2019;s use it for now&#x2014;that the majority of tourism&#x2019;s response to the climate emergency was based on saying things like, &#x201C;For every return flight you book with us to Australia, we&#x2019;ll plant a tree.&#x201D;</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s marketing and it&#x2019;s feeble. With Tourism Declares, and now the Glasgow Declaration, at the heart of it is a commitment to recognize what the climate scientists are saying: That we need to cut global emissions in half by 2030, and we need to align our operations with that. We&#x2019;re saying, &#x201C;That&#x2019;s the line, drawn by the climate scientists&#x201D;.</p>
<p>Is it enough? No, it&#x2019;s not enough. We always need to do more. Cutting emissions in half by 2030 is too slow. We should be cutting emissions in half by <em>tomorrow</em>, but that&#x2019;s not going to happen without a huge number of other consequences. But what&#x2019;s happened this week in Glasgow is enormous&#x2014;a never-before-seen coming together of our industry and destinations and communities to commit to climate action and with a capacity to make it possible.</p>

        <p><strong>Have any airlines declared a climate emergency yet?</strong></p>
<p>One airline has bravely declared it; a Tanzanian airline called Regional Air. There&#x2019;s no getting around the fact that the easiest way to reduce emissions related to tourism is to reduce aviation, because that&#x2019;s where such a significant part of tourism&#x2019;s emissions come from.</p>
<p>And I do think that where it is replaceable, we should totally be looking to replace it. But I&#x2019;ve spoken with airline groups and they find the framework extremely challenging&#x2014;and we can&#x2019;t change the science to fit them in.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see the balance between individual and industry responsibility for tourism&#x2019;s carbon emissions: Who should do more?&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p>Obviously everyone has to play their part, but the onus for change should weigh most heavily on those organizations that profit from the situation we&#x2019;ve found ourselves in, that design the marketing to encourage us to take the flights, to do the holidays, that made us all believe that &#x2018;relaxation&#x2019; and &#x2018;status&#x2019; means &#x2019;one week on the other side of the world.&#x2019;.</p>
<p>As an industry, we&#x2019;re very fond of saying we&#x2019;re responsible for one in 10 jobs and 10 per cent of global GDP. Well, surely that puts us in a position of responsibility to be a leader, if we&#x2019;re responsible for a tenth of everything? It&#x2019;s time to stand up and make some changes.</p>
<p>Also, we are a unique industry because we can take people to places to experience what a better world could be like. I&#x2019;ve always felt that tourism has this ability to show people a vision of the future, to say, &#x201C;This is what it&#x2019;s like to stay in a building that&#x2019;s entirely sustainably built and run, to eat totally organic food, etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Then people go home and think, &#x201C;That was amazing!&#x201D; and start making changes in their lives. That puts the travel industry in the most enormous position of opportunity and, I think, responsibility.</p>

        <p><strong>How concerned are you about the impact of &#x2019;revenge travel&#x2019;, the anticipated post-pandemic travel boom sparked by people wanting to &#x2018;get back&#x2019; at COVID-19?</strong></p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a horrible phrase and in the context of the post-overtourism return, it is hugely concerning. Throughout COVID-19, I&#x2019;ve often been asked, &#x201C;Do you think we&#x2019;re going to change massively and everything in tourism is going to become sustainable?&#x201D; and I massively hope so. Do I think &#x2019;revenge travel&#x2019; is going to be a thing? I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>What&#x2019;s one thing you&#x2019;d like all travelers to understand to help them travel more sustainably?&#xA0;</strong></p>
<p>Beauty is nearby. We&#x2019;ve built this whole &#x2018;bucket list&#x2019; mentality of &#x2018;ticking things off&#x2019; and once you&#x2019;ve seen it, you move onto the next thing.</p>
<p>But that&#x2019;s such a shallow way to see things. When one discovers incredible things relatively nearby, there&#x2019;s an enormous benefit obviously in not flying to the other side of the world, but the other benefit is you get to go back.</p>
<p>And going back is what makes things better. I like to think one of the positives of COVID-19, &#xA0;is that we&#x2019;ve started realizing that the world we live in for work and school and whatever else is also a magical world we can visit for long weekends and return to again and again, and that changes our relationship with the world. That&#x2019;s what &#x201C;sustainable tourism&#x201D; means to me.</p>
<p><strong>Now that the Glasgow Declaration is up and running, will Tourism Declares slowly fade into the sunset?</strong></p>
<p>Not at all. This is the end of the first chapter in our story. Tourism Declares will now be the flagship climate action program of the Travel Foundation, which ensures we have the governance, the funding, the structure and the support network to do much more than we could as a group of committed volunteers.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;re still going to be very much a part of it all, doing all we can to make sure the necessary changes happen. Because it&#x2019;s one thing to say we&#x2019;ve got to cut emissions in half by 2030, it&#x2019;s a whole other thing to arrive at 2030 and say, &#x201C;We did it.&#x201D;</p>

<p><strong>As a signatory and launch partner of the historic Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism at COP26, Intrepid Travel co-founder Darrell Wade explains why this moment matters.&#xA0;</strong></p>



<p>Greta is right: the time for &#x201C;blah blah blah&#x201D; is over. The climate crisis is without doubt the issue of our times, and the travel industry, which is responsible for an estimated 8 per cent of global emissions, should be taking its contribution to this crisis very seriously.</p>



<p>For long too long there has been too much talk and too much rhetoric when it comes to climate action&#x2014;whether that&#x2019;s in the travel industry or beyond. There has been action on a variety of fronts, sure. But while offsetting, tree planting, carbon credits and other such solutions have their place, they&#x2019;re ultimately not going to cut it. What the world needs is <em>actual</em> carbon reduction. Fast. And at scale.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/glasgow-declaraton-tourism-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glasgow Declaration explained: Climate action for tourism finally takes the spotlight</a></strong></p>



<p>As an industry we need more measurable action, and we need to be able to hold organizations who claim to be taking climate action to account. We need decarbonization on a massive scale: less greenwashing, more green-doing.</p>



<p>Sustainable travel advocates and industry insiders Jeremy Smith and Alex Narracott had the right idea when they founded <a href="https://www.tourismdeclares.com/">Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency</a> back in 2019. That incredible movement, which was run by volunteers, resulted in close to 400 travel organizations signing up to commit to climate action. It was clear that there was real appetite for change from small to medium sized companies all around the world. </p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Travel companies have to take action. And show us you mean it: sign this Declaration, and prove you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.</p></blockquote>



<p>But if we&#x2019;re looking to decarbonize as an industry, we need to get the big carbon emitters (think airlines, hotel chains, cruise lines) on board. And we need them to remain on board for the long haul.</p>



<p>That&#x2019;s why the announcement of the Glasgow Declaration: A Commitment to a Decade of Tourism Climate Action at COP26 this week is so important. This industry-changing Declaration is an evolution of Jeremy and Alex&#x2019;s Tourism Declares work (and the work of many other brilliant and committed individuals), except now it has the backing of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), among others.</p>



<p>The Declaration&#x2019;s goals are clearly defined, and we will be able to measure and track signatories&#x2019; progress against their pledges. That framework and accountability is important: this is about action, not talk.</p>

        <p>I have this week signed the Glasgow Declaration as Vice Chair of World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)&#x2014;a role I have held for the past year. Intrepid Travel, the company I co-founded 30 years ago, is also a signatory. The Declaration has two primary goals: the first is to commit signatories to reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, and the second is to commit them to becoming net zero by 2050. And beneath that, there are a number of other clear commitments, like releasing a climate plan within the first 12 months of signing as a way to validate your method towards decarbonization.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/jeremy-smith-glasgow-declaration-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;A landmark moment&#x201D;: Jeremy Smith, co-founder of Tourism Declares, on the significance of the Glasgow Declaration</a></strong></p>
<p>The second initiative to be unveiled at COP26 is the &#x2018;Roadmap to 2050&#x2019;, which has been prepared in conjunction with WTTC members and Accenture. The roadmap is an initiative by the WTTC, and it takes a sector-specific approach to reaching net zero for 2050. There are separate work streams for aviation, hotels, cruise, tour operators and destinations. This work is important, because when an organization comes to us and says: &#x201C;Sorry, that can&#x2019;t be done&#x201D;, we can show them the roadmap and say: &#x201C;Yes it can, and here&#x2019;s how.&#x201D;</p>
<p>On top of that, Intrepid&#x2019;s very own Environmental Impact Specialist, Susanne Etti, in partnership with Tourism Declares, has authored an open-source <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/au/download-our-carbon-measurement-blueprint-for-tour-operators">Carbon Measurement Blueprint for Tour Operators</a>. It&#x2019;s designed to help other tour operators begin to measure their carbon emissions because if they can measure, they can begin to reduce.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#x2019;s on us&#x2014;travelers and travel organizations alike&#x2014;to turn this climate moment into a climate movement. The decisions we make matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inconvenient truth, though, is that the travel industry is <em>way</em> behind where it needs to be, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to get our house in order and aligned with Paris obligations and a 1.5 degree world. It&#x2019;s true that some industries&#x2014;like aviation and shipping&#x2014;are harder to decarbonize than others, but one way or another the world will and must decarbonize, or we have no future at all.</p>
<p>I can&#x2019;t say this plainly enough, but when it comes to the climate&#x2014;whether the travel industry or any other industry&#x2014;the time for talking is over. We must act now, we must act together, and we must <em>work</em> together if we&#x2019;re going to have a hope in hell of pulling this off. Travel companies have to take action. And show us you mean it: sign this Declaration, and prove you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.</p>
<p>Now this is all obviously very heavy and very serious stuff. But for me, and I think for all of us at Intrepid Travel, and certainly for my co-founder Geoff, this duty of care we feel towards this magnificent planet and all of the creatures on it is a direct result of the many experiences we&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to have all over it. We owe it to one another, and to future generations, to secure a truly sustainable future. And for individual travelers who care about this issue&#x2014;I know there are a lot of you&#x2014;you can now choose to use the services of more than 300 companies that have signed the Glasgow Declaration.</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m moving into the final days of COP26 and beyond with a sense of cautious optimism. I think humans are capable of pretty incredible things when backed into a corner (even if it&#x2019;s a corner of their own making), but it&#x2019;s going to take all of us to get this right. It&#x2019;s on us&#x2014;travelers and travel organizations alike&#x2014;to turn this climate moment into a climate movement. The decisions we make matter. And what we do next is going to matter for a very long time to come.</p>

<p><strong>When Luke Waterson decided on a last-minute holiday in Scotland&#xA0;and found everything was booked, he ordered a stash of OS maps, planned a 275-mile, 12-day hike across Scotland&#x2014;and left the next day.</strong><br><br>Growing up, the atlas was the biggest book our family owned. Too large for our bookshelves, it lay below, covered by the paraphernalia that got piled on top. It was an undertaking just to pull it out. And if I think back to my earliest wanderlust, it&#x2019;s this: That silvery outline of a globe on the spine, stuck under a mound of much duller things.<br><br>That atlas&#x2014;and soon enough, any cartography&#x2014;began assuming a hallowed quality in my mind. Perusing a map became special, a treat for when I had the time. I&#x2019;d spend hours tracing imaginary journeys across gridded depictions of counties, countries, continents.<br><br>These journeys shared a common theme. They all traversed all of something. A mountain was unexciting in itself; it was crossing the range that held the allure.</p>

        <p>I especially loved a map&#x2019;s extremes. I loved how Tierra del Fuego, for example, bulged audaciously beyond the bottom lines of an otherwise within-the-grid southern South America. I loved how a map page&#x2019;s bands of lake-splashed brown announced high-elevation areas&#x2014;and how road-free, building-free and savagely different they seemed compared to the paler, blander colors portraying civilization.</p>
<p>Nor was it enough, on these fantasy travels, to envisage myself immediately <em>there</em> at these extreme points. I had to <em>earn</em> my arrival, and the means was always on foot&#x2014;Land&#x2019;s End from London, the Boothia Peninsula from Vancouver, rock by rock, horizon by horizon. No other way would do because, well, I might miss out on something.</p>

<p>It must have been with this in mind when this summer, when I found myself with some unexpected free time, I decided to plan a long hike. I quickly realized that this was also the time of year many people would normally be going on holiday here in the UK.</p>
<p>But these weren&#x2019;t ordinary times. The post-lockdown travel choices&#x2014;jumping through a series of ever-changing hoops on a flight to whatever destination made that week&#x2019;s green list, or a UK holiday oversubscribed by everyone who didn&#x2019;t fancy the hoop-jumping&#x2014;were limited.</p>
<p>Any accommodation worth staying in had invariably been booked solid, deep into winter. <em>Wild camping then</em>, I thought, dusting off my gear, <em>and in Scotland, where it&#x2019;s permitted.</em></p>

        <p>Closer analysis showed that while I&#x2019;d traveled widely in Scotland&#x2019;s north and south, its east and west were gaps in my knowledge.

        <p>Holiday planning is so much simpler when you&#x2019;re compass-point obsessed. I ordered the Ordinance Survey/OS hiking maps covering the 275-odd mile route (all 12 of them), waited for next-day delivery, hoping they&#x2019;d come early enough to make the last train of the day to Aberdeenshire (they did) and by that evening, I was in Peterhead, incredibly itchy-footed.</p>
<p>I realized I was doing one of the few types of trips it was possible to embark on in a pandemic world with less than 24 hours of pre-planning. The big negative of travel now is how the impromptu has been squeezed out of it. This time, I was getting a bit of that back.</p>

Not necessarily because of their appearance or because I had each utterly to myself, but because I had planned the way between them, calculated where to best depart one map at so as to arrive on the next map near path X, having avoided major road Y without forgoing a tantalising-looking expanse of hill range Z.</p>

        <p>Orienteering like this, there are no worries about whether you make so-and-so flight, get a table at so-and-so restaurant. Only two things stand in your way&#x2014;the land and your ability to cross it.</p>

        <p>Scotland, I discovered anew, is the type of challenge that orienteers relish. Its map language vividly shines a light on its culture, and leaves clues as to what you might spy on the trail.</p>
<p>Among the 30-odd words I encountered here for &#x2018;summit&#x2019;, there are &#x2018;<em>sidhean&#x2019;</em>, fairy hill, and &#x2018;<em>buachaille&#x2019;</em>, a hill shaped like a shepherd. No rights of way feature on Scottish maps, as most land is publicly accessible, but as a result, fewer paths are distinctly marked. And those that are, particularly on a rain-damp map, bear strong resemblance to the symbols for power lines, which are less fun to walk along.</p>
<p>The easy-to-follow country lanes of the east erupt, with little warning, into entire mapsheets of pathless mountainside where you must switch from complacently following signposts to furiously scrutinising mapscape contour lines and crag lines for that optimum through-route.</p>
<p>And inevitably, as I found only upon reaching the first serious highlands, the valleyside paths that are the main means of crossing them run overwhelmingly north-south. Heading westward-bound, it was over the top then down then up again, like a brutal multi-day rollercoaster ride.</p>
<p>There were certain tricks to the trade. Estate tracks were among the few that went against the grain and in the direction I needed&#x2014;a ruined croft could have just enough sheep-nibbled grass to provide respite from the midges lurking in the heather-cloaked moor that dominated the route.</p>

        <p>Equally, 12 days and nights of choose-your-own-adventure hiking across rough country and making camp wherever tiredness overwhelms at day&#x2019;s end is hard, despite the intense beauty.</p>
<p>The dirt never really washes off, swamp always soaks through, and the rucksack straps always cut through. Map misreadings dollop miles onto your journey sooner or later&#x2014;and unfailingly at the worst possible time. It is hard to conceive I would have endured the whole of it without a compass-point-to-compass-point traverse as my motivation.</p>
<p>But gradually, the way I had walked became more formidable than the way remaining. Negotiating one section of trackless terrain emboldened me for the next, and there were more &#x2018;I did it&#x2019; moments.</p>

        <p>And on the thirteenth morning, the land finally gave up. There it was, Ardnamurchan point. It had all linked together&#x2014;main roads and market towns to mires to mountaintop trig points to this lighthouse-crested headland where seals basked on the skerries, and sea surged around me on three sides.</p>
<p>And an orienteer&#x2019;s elation seized me, the sensation of eventually coming out the other side OK, of having glimpsed the great and the good and the pleasant and the bad of the land, rather than just an airbrushed snapshot. And now, there were no more turns of the map.</p>

    <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end">

<p><strong>For <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/emily-thomas-341632">Emily Thomas</a>, Associate Professor of Philosophy at <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/durham-university-867">Durham University</a></em> in the United Kingdom, travel and philosophy are forever intertwined. Here, she makes her case. </strong><br><br>In 2019, there were <a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152">1.4 billion international tourist arrivals</a> globally&#x2014;and, given that the planet only holds <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">7.7 billion humans</a>, this figure alone suggests that a lot of us are travelling. The World Tourism Organization <a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152">reports</a> two major motivations for this&#x2014;&#x201C;travel to change&#x201D;: the quest for local experiences, authenticity, transformation and &#x201C;travel to show&#x201D;: the desire for Instagrammable moments and destinations.<br><br>I think both trends are fuelled by curiosity about the unknown, the unfamiliar. Humans have always looked for new experiences, ways to live, things to show to others. Travel magazines are strewn with articles about visiting &#x201C;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/travel/2020/01/why-travel-2020-experience-overlooked-destinations-want-your-attention">overlooked</a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19095928-3eaa-11ea-b84f-a62c46f39bc2">unknown</a>&#x201D; places&#x2014;and this curiosity has a long history.<br><br>Throughout his <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14363">Antarctic explorations</a>, Apsley Cherry-Garrard yearns for &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; places. Mary Kingsley describes the &#x201C;sheer good pleasure&#x201D; of canoeing down an &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891">West African</a> river by moonlight, and delights in places &#x201C;not down&#x201D; on maps. A character in Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s Heart of Darkness describes how &#x201C;inviting&#x201D; the &#x201C;blank spaces on the earth&#x201D; seem and tells us about his hankering for &#x201C;the biggest, the most blank&#x201D;.<br><br>Philosophy can also be about exploring the unknown. In one of his <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SM2AzN_ZlmIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=berkeley+dialogues&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_lfXolJznAhXqVBUIHePyBcEQ6AEIPjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">groundbreaking books</a> on idealism, 18th-century Irish philosopher George Berkeley likened his investigations to a &#x201C;long Voyage&#x201D;, involving difficult travel across &#x201C;wild Mazes of Philosophy&#x201D;. Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume offers similar reflections halfway through his most radical sceptical work <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-L4IAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hume+treatise+of+human+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9p-bWlJznAhWRYsAKHeFOCmoQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">A Treatise of Human Nature</a>.<br><br>He imagines himself as a sailor who has struck shallow water, narrowly escaping shipwreck. Safety tempts him to remain perched on the rocks, rather than venturing out onto &#x201C;that boundless ocean, which runs out into immensity&#x201D;. Yet Hume decides he will put out to sea again, in the same &#x201C;leaky weather-beaten vessel&#x201D;.</p>



<h2>Wild mazes of thought</h2>



<p>The &#x201C;philosophy of travel&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t a thing. It isn&#x2019;t the subject of lecture courses, or conferences&#x2014;there are no lists of great philosophical travellers. But, as I argue in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/019883540X?pf_rd_p=f20e70b1-67f9-48d1-8c78-ba616030b420&amp;pf_rd_r=TDTYNR8TNG2J459STQ13">The Meaning of Travel: Philosophers Abroad</a>, travel and philosophy have enjoyed a quiet love affair for centuries.</p>



<p>Travellers and philosophers can both aim at pushing the limits of their knowledge&#x2014;at seeing how the world is. Adventurous travellers covet new places&#x2014;even Earth&#x2019;s unexplored oceans and planets around distant stars. Radical philosophers crafts new questions and shake old assumptions. What is time? Or matter? Or goodness?</p>



<p>You might think wishing for the unknown is the only thing philosophy and travel have in common. Travel involves trains, passports, luggage. Philosophy involves books, ethics, bearded Greeks. But despite their differences, travel and philosophy are tangled together. Travel has affected philosophy, and philosophy has affected travel.</p>



<p>Travel can help philosophers develop new questions. For example, 17th-century European travellers began bringing home, en masse, reports of foreign customs and beliefs. John Locke, the &#x201C;father of liberalism&#x201D;&#x2014;and a voracious reader of travel books&#x2014;discussed practices that Europeans found shocking. His <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDNIAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=locke+essay+concerning+human+understanding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRgc7ClZznAhXSgVwKHas_DmsQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=locke%20essay%20concerning%20human%20understanding&amp;f=false">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a> describes cannibalism among peoples in Georgia, the Caribbean and Peru; the immodest sex lives of Turkish saints; and atheism running rampant throughout China and Thailand.</p>



<p>Some of these reports were erroneous: reports of cannibalism <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Everyone_Eats.html?id=3xWt_kWk6L8C">were exaggerated</a>, while&#x2014;even then&#x2014;China and Thailand had long religious traditions. But it was becoming clear that people across the planet disagree about ethics and religion. Locke used these disagreements to raise a philosophical question. Are there any innate ideas that all humans are born knowing? (For Locke, the answer was &#x201C;no&#x201D;.)</p>



<h2>New questions</h2>



<p>Travel is still prompting new questions today. What are the ethics of doom tourism, to places affected by climate change? Can we imagine what other, non-human minds are like? How might space travel affect us?</p>



<p>Just as travel has moved philosophy forward, philosophy has sometimes pushed travel practices in new directions. Every so often, a new philosophical idea impels travel to particular places, or in particular ways. For example, American literary scholar Marjorie Hope Nicolson&#x2019;s <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Aw8j8JZhxpYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Marjorie+Hope+Nicolson%E2%80%99s+book+Mountain+Gloom,+Mountain+Glory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXx9_NlZznAhXhUBUIHe_RDUgQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Mountain Gloom, Mountain Glory</a> argues that, from the late 17th century, a new theory of space incited tourists to visit mountains. On this &#x201C;<a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-space-the-300-year-old-philosophical-battle-that-is-still-raging-today-85628">Absolute</a>&#x201D; theory, space is God&#x2019;s immensity or infinite presence.</p>



<p>Nicolson argues this led to people perceiving big, infinite landscapes such as mountains as divine. &#x201C;Great cathedrals of the earth&#x201D;&#x2014;as the Victorian thinker John Ruskin wrote of the Alps&#x2014;&#x201C;altars of snow&#x201D;. Once mountains had become cathedrals, everybody wanted to visit them.</p>



<p>Similarly, the philosophy of wilderness set out in American philosopher Henry Thoreau&#x2019;s <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B_pKAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henry+Thoreau+Walden&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF4O7xlZznAhXJUBUIHSgxDRgQ6wEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Walden</a> started a craze for solitary wilderness travel&#x2014;and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/what-it-means-that-urban-hipsters-like-staring-at-pictures-of-cabins/254495/">cabin porn</a>.</p>



<p>What counts as unknown depends on your starting point. For British sailor James Cook, Alaska and Australia were &#x201C;new&#x201D; lands&#x2014;but their indigenous inhabitants knew them well. Roman Syria would have been unfamiliar to Chinese explorer Gan Ying, but not to the Syrians. Sometimes journeys explore places unknown to all human beings: the depths of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/son-doong-cave-vietnam-expedition/index.html">Son Doong caves</a>, the under-snow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/24/antarctica-mountains">mountains of Antarctica</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/05/space-race-moon-mars-asteroids-commercial-launches">Moon and Mars</a>.</p>



<p>Philosophers can also venture into areas of thought that are new to them but familiar to others. I would have this experience if I began researching medieval German philosophy, or contemporary Chinese philosophy. And philosophers can attempt to strike out into wholly new areas of thought. I think this is when philosophy and travel are at their most fascinating: when they look to the borders of what humans do not know.</p>

<p><strong>Francesco Piattelli swapped his New York lifestyle to work on his family&#x2019;s olive farm in Tuscany. What&#x2019;s that like? Katie McKnoulty joins him during olive oil harvest season to find out.</strong><br><br>We&#x2019;re picking olives in a sun-drenched field overlooking the Tuscan countryside, a classic view of centuries-old hilltop towns and church spires. This view has barely changed in generations.<br><br>Although other things may have&#x2026; Francesco gets out his portable Bluetooth speaker and plays a track you might hear in a Brooklyn coffee shop. Noticing this paradoxical moment too, he turns to me and says, &#x201C;People sometimes look down on agricultural work but I mean, look how much fun we&#x2019;re having!&#x201D;<br><br>It&#x2019;s October and olive harvest time in Monte San Savino. I&#x2019;ve been invited to stay with 37-year-old Italian-American Francesco Piattelli and his partner, Francesca Gambato to experience and document the harvest of their 4.5 hectares of olive trees in the heart of the Toscano IGP denomination. They&#x2019;ve spent the last two years nurturing these olives to produce their organic, sustainable olive oil, <a href="https://agricolamaraviglia.net/">Agricola Maraviglia</a>, and they lead harvesting retreats on the side. They grow and harvest their olives using traditional Tuscan techniques&#x2014;small batch, hands-on and organic. With over 85 per cent of production coming from their restoration of local family-owned groves, they&#x2019;re helping to regenerate the local environment and keep the Tuscan olive oil economy and legacy alive.</p>

        <p>But Francesco didn&#x2019;t always work with the land. Growing up in small-town Tuscany with an American mother and Italian father, he moved to New York City at 26 in search of bigger challenges. But seven years later, stressed out and unsatisfied, he left his life and his advertising agency to return to his homeland.</p>

<p>This also gave him a chance to reconnect with his homeland and figure out his next steps. &#x201C;Living here, you see every season,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;You see the trees. They bloom and they fall and the energy is just so palpable and so strong. The love for olives and nature came after. It&#x2019;s something that surprised me.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>One friend, Magali, lives and works on a natural winery in the south of France with her partner, and travels for various harvests.

        <p>It&#x2019;s my first harvest. If I&#x2019;m honest, I&#x2019;d imagined picking every olive one by one from each silvery-green branch and placing it in a woven basket slung over my arm. But that&#x2019;s not how it&#x2019;s done.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s not so much picking the olives as it is shaking and combing the trees, and catching the falling olives on meters-long nets laid out below. There are even strategy meetings to decide how best to divest the trees of their bounty, as efficiently as possible, to get those early-harvest green olives that make the best-tasting olive oil. And we&#x2019;ve got 800 trees to cover.</p>

        <p>Of these 800 trees, only 100 are Francesco&#x2019;s; the rest are on loan from local families. Generations past felt connected to these olive trees, seeing them as their duty, not to mention an extra income. But today, with the sorry price the oil commands and younger generations no longer maintaining the trees or simply moving&#xA0; away, many groves around Monte San Savino sit abandoned.</p>

        <p>Lunchtime arrives quickly. Francesco has parked his bright green Piaggio Ape in the middle of the field and folded down the tray to make a buffet table. Francesca piles it high with fresh bread, salad and tomatoes from their garden, and, of course, olive oil. Someone gets a fire going and the next minute, Francesco is grilling fat, juicy sausages over the flames and lunch al fresco begins.</p>

<p>We spend all afternoon working in the fields until the light has faded over the landscape and it&#x2019;s time to rush today&#x2019;s olives to the mill to be cold-pressed while they&#x2019;re fresh.</p>
<p>Francesco breaks it to me gently that the &#x2018;Italian&#x2019; olive oil we see en masse in supermarkets actually comes from disparate farms all over Europe via these mills. &#x201C;In the supermarkets and even in gourmet stores, it&#x2019;s really rare to find olive oil from one single farm.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>During the drive, with crates of olives stacked up behind us, I ask &#x200B;&#x200B;Francesco something I&#x2019;d been dying to ask someone under retirement age who had, like me, swapped the city for the country. Was this a cool, new thing to do or were we just getting old before our time?</p>
<p>&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;re getting old!&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s definitely not a mass phenomenon, but it&#x2019;s a phenomenon that&#x2019;s becoming noticeable. We are the first generation that grew up with the values and the teachings and the expectations of the &#x2018;90s&#x2026;. You make a lot of money, you have a career, the dream. And our parents, with that dream, destroyed the world.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x201C;Then as soon as you get out of high school, you bang your head against the wall,&#x201D; he adds. &#x201C;You go to university then you study finance and you become a doctor, a lawyer. You do all of that and then you don&#x2019;t find a job and it doesn&#x2019;t work.&#x201D;</p>

<div>
    <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">
        <p>The absence of a big-ticket job combined with a growing urge to connect with nature and ourselves, city life can lose some of its pull. &#x201C;Maybe you make less money than you would living in Manhattan and working for a big bank,&#x201D; says Francesco. &#x201C;But you spend way less money to have the same thing. I&#x2019;m not a kamikaze&#x2026; I&#x2019;m doing this because I love it and it&#x2019;s fun, but also because I can live off of it comfortably. There is a business, there just has to be a new model.&#x201D;</p>
<p>We queue at the mill to weigh our bounty, alongside family cars and large trucks. Some of these people will use their oil at home to last the whole next year. Others will sell it to the mill for a tiny price, who will sell it to big brands for a slightly less tiny price.</p>
<p>As a result, when we buy this big brand oil, we inadvertently perpetuate a cycle of diminishing food quality and dismal pay for the people laboring at the bottom of the chain.</p>

        <p>The next day, we eat lunch together around a long table at the farmhouse. Francesca cuts the radicchio and goat&#x2019;s cheese quiche fresh out of the oven and dresses the fresh green salad with lashings of olive oil. It&#x2019;s all made by her hand, using ingredients taken just hours ago from their bountiful garden, a hundred meters from where we sit.</p>
<p>I have a new appreciation for this amber liquid sitting on the table. It&#x2019;s not just the delicious oil itself. It&#x2019;s everything it represents.&#xA0;It&#x2019;s a way of living, working, consuming that works with the planet and the people, not against them.</p>
<p>It may be just a bottle of olive oil made by one man, on a small farm in a tiny corner of the world, but it&#x2019;s pointing us in the right direction.</p>
