<p>When it comes to the world of wholesome video games, there are few that rival <a rel="noopener" href="/animal-crossing-new-horizon/" target="_blank" title="Animal Crossing"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>. Alongside the adorable villagers, the game's colourful art style and simplistic tasks mean it's a million miles away from bloodier FPS titles like <em>Call of Duty</em>. </p>
<p>Whether it's tending to your pumpkin patch and then popping by to get a <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/animal-crossing-players-vow-to-return-after-nintendos-latest-update/" target="_blank" title="Animal Crossing Players Vow To Return After Nintendo's Latest Update">cup of coffee with Brewster</a>, kitting out your home with some help from Wardell, or exploring the oceans with Kapp'n, <em>New Horizons</em> is a family-friendly affair for all... or is it? </p>

<h2>What Is The Naked Animal Crossing Glitch?</h2>

</div>
</div>
<p>The internet is filled with worried players posting about their villagers wandering around in the buff. Yes, we know they're just pixel animals, but still, we've come to expect them to be dressed in their finery over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>There's apparently an <em>Animal Crossing</em> glitch in the <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> DLC<span> that sees one particular locale turned into a nudist colony. The <em>Full Monty</em> strip show seemingly occurs on Lottie's vacation islands in the caf√©. We're not sure why it's happening here or how to fix it, so get used to naked villagers for now.</span></p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p><span>Of course, it's led to a wave of hilarious posts where players show off their nude villagers in all their glory. We guess it's a bit like when Donald Duck puts on a towel when getting out of the shower - despite the fact he wears no trousers.</span></p>

            <![CDATA[<p>The <em>Halo Inifnite</em> multiplayer beta has been live for a little while now, and players are loving it so far. The game is a return to form for the franchise, and with the fact that it's completely free-to-play, it offers the <a rel="noopener" href="/halo/" target="_blank" title="Halo"><em>Halo</em></a> series a chance to get back to the forefront of the <a href="/articles/did-halo-infinite-just-kill-battlefield-2042/" title="Did Halo Infinite Just Kill Battlefield 2042?">FPS genre</a>. </p>

<p>But, as the title has already become stale for some, it means gamers are starting to get creative. Now, one <em>Halo Infinite</em> fan has performed an amazing feat in an online game that paves the way for incredible Spartan<em> </em>achievements to come.</p>
<h2>Player Kills 23 Enemies With A Single Bullet</h2>

<p>One player in <em>Halo Infinite</em>'s multiplayer has finished off 23 enemy players with just one bullet. In a video posted to Twitter, a user has pushed the limits of the game's sniper rifle to the absolute brink and has used its persistent qualities to rack up a new record for kills in a matter of seconds.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">

</div>
<p>Twitter user Sakanayalugang has shared the video in which they line up 23 rivals, step in front of them, ready the shot, and with a single round, tick through the heads of every single enemy in front of them.</p>
<p>The bullet becomes slow-moving (likely as it has a lot of skulls to blast through), but it eventually reaches the back of the queue and polishes off the final Spartan.</p>

<p>The post has even earned some respect from the official <a href="/xbox/" title="Xbox">Xbox</a> account in Japan. That's one hell of a seal of approval. Fans are loving the video posted to Twitter, and some seem perplexed by the speed at which the bullet moves.</p>
<p>The video is great, and shows off the potentially infinite power of the <em>Halo Infinite</em> sniper. Who knows - maybe this simple viral video could lead to a game-wide nerf? It's only a matter of time before someone aims for a 24-kill streak with one bullet.</p>

        <title>Halo Infinite Player Count: How Many People Play Halo Infinite</title>

            <![CDATA[<p>The <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count is a great indicator of just how well 343 Industries' return to the acclaimed shooter really is. Players were whipped up into a frenzy when <a href="/halo/"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> received a surprise early launch to mark the 20th anniversary of both <em>Halo </em>and Xbox. Yet now that we've had a bit of time to settle into a new <em>Halo </em>multiplayer once more, how are the numbers holding up? Here's everything you need to know about the <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><em>Getting into a bit of Halo yourself? Check out our <a href="/guides/halo-infinite-multiplayer-tips/">Halo Infinite multiplayer tips</a>. </em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Halo Infinite Player Count: Total And Concurrent</h2>
<p><img src="/media/rjindneo/halo-infinite-split-screen-tutorial.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Two Spartans face off." width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Since the launch of <em>Halo Infinite </em>multiplayer there has been a fair degree of controversy surrounding the battle pass progression. So much so that 343 Industries added new XP buffs that make it far easier to progress through. We broke down the major changes in our <a href="/guides/halo-infinite-xp-progression/"><em>Halo Infinite </em>XP progression</a> guide, if you are interested. </p>
<p>However, that doesn't seem to have too much of an impact on the overall numbers of the game. <a rel="noopener" href="https://steamdb.info/app/1240440/graphs/" target="_blank">According to Steam Database</a>, the <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count reached an all-time peak of 272,586 players. Compare that to the <em>Halo: Master Chief Collection </em>which reportedly reached 161,024 at its peak, although those are rereleases of older games. Undoubtedly, <em>Halo Infinite </em>being a free-to-play multiplayer title has increased its player base since anyone on PC or Xbox can just download and jump right into a game. It's worth noting the Steam Database also only tracks players on PC playing through Steam; players on Xbox or playing through the Xbox app on PC aren't included in this total.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Today, the <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count sat at 107,792 player peak in the last 24-hours at the time of writing. Looking at the charts, you can see the numbers steadily declining, however that is only natural in the weeks following a major release. The player count may receive a slight boost once the full campaign is released.</p>

<h2>Halo Infinite Player Count: Twitch Viewership</h2>
<p><img src="/media/ynbbywoo/halo-infinite-player-count.jpg?width=500&amp;height=158.84773662551441" alt="The Halo Infinite Twitch numbers." width="500" height="158.84773662551441" data-caption=""></p>
<p>The <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count may be doing well in the actual game, but what about over on Twitch? Oddly enough, <em>Halo Infinite </em>didn't manage to break the top ten most streamed games <a rel="noopener" href="http://v" target="_blank">according to Twitch tracker</a>. Instead it landed in 18th place, in-between the Music and Sports categories. It managed to average out with 28,170 viewers across the last week. However, considering that the multiplayer doesn't feature hero shooter elements or a battle royale-like mode, it shouldn't surprise us too much. Especially when you begin to consider that <em>Halo Infinite Multiplayer </em>is actually still in beta and only features a handful of short match modes. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Halo Infinite Player Count: Will Infinite's Audience Stay?</h2>
<h2><img src="/media/yvuonnc5/halo-infinite-promo.jpg?width=500&amp;height=263.3333333333333" alt="Will the Halo Infinite player count remain for future updates?" width="500" height="263.3333333333333" data-caption=""> </h2>
<p>Whether the <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count will stay or not at this point is really up in the air. The community response to the multiplayer experience has been brilliant, but the issue will really lie in progression. While battle pass difficulty has been eased, the <em>Heroes of Reach </em>season will last all the way up until May 2, 2022. A short hour-long session each day will progress you one battle pass level, and that is if you don't complete any additional weekly challenges. It's safe to say a large portion of the <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count will be done and dusted with the battle pass long before the new season starts, and once that's complete there is no real progression-based reason to keep playing. </p>
<p>The issues with progression will likely cause a major dipping and peaking issue of the <em>Halo Infinite </em>player count, with players flocking to the game when new content arrives, and leaving as soon as it has nothing to offer them. And while each week offers a new cosmetic, playing for hours to receive an elbow pad might not always be intriguing enough of an offer for some players. </p>

            <![CDATA[<p><em>Pokemon BDSP </em>Unown has made a return in the <em>Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl </em>remakes, after the alphabet Pokemon first appeared in the second generation of games. In <em><a href="/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl/" title="Pokemon BDSP">Pokemon BDSP</a> </em>(and every other <em><a href="/pokemon/" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> </em>game), Unown are shaped like the alphabet, with 28 different variations in total. Yes, the alphabet only has 26 letters, but there are two extra. If you're wondering exactly where to find and catch a <em>Pokemon BDSP </em>Unown, how to navigate through the cave Unown resides in, and some tips for catching Unown, here's everything you need to know.</p>

<h2>Pokemon BDSP Unown Location</h2>

<p>The only place that Unown can be found in <em>Pokemon BDSP</em> is at the Solaceon Ruins. This can be accessed as soon as you make it to Solaceon Town. Head to the top of Solaceon Town and then head east through some trees and you will come to a lot of ledges that can be jumped down.</p>
<p>To access the Solaceon Ruins you will need to walk as far right as you can and then jump down the ledges on this side. If you jump down any of the others you will come to a dead-end and have to do it again. Once you jump down all of the ledges on the right hand side you will come to the entrance of Solaceon Ruins.</p>

<h2>Pokemon BDSP Unown: Solaceon Ruins Layout</h2>
<p><img src="/media/3nffksyf/pokemon-bdsp-wild-unown.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.1360083376759?width=500&amp;height=281" alt="Pokemon BDSP Solaceon Ruins" width="500" height="281" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Solaceon Ruins is made up of many different passageways and rooms, each being home to a certain Unown. There are six main passageways in Solaceon Ruins, each allowing players to catch an Unown which will spell out "FRIEND". The remaining 20 can be found in the smaller rooms with a rock in the middle of them. It is worth checking each of these rocks because some have items hidden in them.</p>
<p>But once you are in a small room just wander around until a battle triggers, and then once you've caught the Unown you can leave the room and head to the next one. It would be wise to make a note of which rooms you've been in, even draw yourself a map or find one online so you can make sure you're not wandering around a room that you've already been in. It's fairly simple stuff as long as you remember which way you entered from though.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Pokemon BDSP Unown: How To Catch The Final Two</h2>
<p>Once the 26 alphabets Unown have been caught, players will unlock a new area of the Solaceon Ruins where the final two Unown can be found. The final two are the exclamation point and question mark Unown variants.</p>
<p>However, these can only be accessed by heading through Route 214 to another entrance to the Solaceon Ruins. Head south on Route 214 until you reach a cave that has a Ruins Maniac NPC. If all 26 Unown are caught he will dig through the wall to allow you to access the secret area of the Solaceon Ruins where the final two Unown can be caught.</p>

<h2>Pokemon BDSP Unown Tips</h2>

<p>It might seem daunting to have to catch 26 Pokemon, but they aren't that difficult to catch. We recommend that you stock up on Quick Balls and Dusk Balls and it will make things much easier. Quick Balls work best when used at the beginning of the encounter, with the Unown being fairly low level there is a good chance you will be able to catch many of them this way without battling them. Should you need to battle them, which is likely for the six Unowns in the main passageways, we recommend using Dusk Balls as they make catching Pokemon in caves much easier.</p>
<p>Most of the Unowns are around the level 20 mark, so if you are doing this later on in the game when your main party is much stronger you may have to head to the Pokemon Center and take a look at your box and create a new party of weaker Pokemon, just so you have less chance of knocking them out. But, should you accidentally defeat them, you can continue to wander around the area until a new encounter triggers, these aren't just a one-time Pokemon that you can encounter like the legendary Pokemon and the ever-elusive <a href="/guides/pokemon-bdsp-drifloon-location-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl/"><em>Pokemon BDSP</em> Drifloon</a>.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>The <em>Pokemon BDSP </em>Mean Look move can be an incredibly useful move to have in your party, because the move prevents wild Pokemon from escaping. This can make catching three of the legendary Pokemon in <a href="/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl/" title="Pokemon BDSP"><em>Pokemon BDSP</em></a>, Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf, much easier, because they tend to flee from battles pretty often. Thankfully, getting the <em>Pokemon BDSP </em>Mean Look isn't very difficult, although the the method is different from obtaining something like <a href="/guides/pokemon-bdsp-waterfall-tm99-location/" title="Pokemon BDSP Waterfall: Where To Find TM99"><em>Pokemon BDSP </em>Waterfall</a>. Here's what you need to know.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<h2>Pokemon BDSP Mean Look Location</h2>
<p>There are 100 TMs in <em>Pokemon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em>. Unfortunately, the Mean Look TM isn't one of them, which means that players can't simply teach a Pokemon the move at will, and will instead have to find a wild Pokemon that can learn the move.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Not caught a Drifloon yet? Our <a href="/guides/pokemon-bdsp-drifloon-location-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl/" title="Pokemon BDSP Drifloon: How To Catch It">Pokemon BDSP Drifloon</a> guide tells you all you need to know.</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Pokemon BDSP Mean Look Pokemon</h2>
<p><img src="/media/pwvbo2dk/pokemon-bdsp-zubat-mean-look.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.1360083376759?width=500&amp;height=281" alt="Pokemon BDSP Mean Look" width="500" height="281" data-caption="" /></p>
<p>In total, there are 17 Pokemon that can learn Mean Look through levelling up. This means that if you want Mean Look to be part of your team in <em>Pokemon BDSP</em> then you will need to catch one of the Pokemon below.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The good thing is, none of them are Pokemon that are only available once, which means you will definitely be able to find a Pokemon to build up ready to compete with the Mean Look. Some of the Pokemon on the list learn Mean Look at level 1, which means that if you breed the Pokemon with either a Ditto or two of the same Pokemon, the Pokemon from the egg will hatch at level 1 and immediately learn Mean Look.</p>
<p>And, if you didn't realize the potential of the move and chose not to teach it to your Pokemon, you can always visit the <a href="/guides/pokemon-bdsp-move-relearner-tutor-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl/"><em>Pokemon BDSP</em> Move Relearner</a> and learn the move again</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Here are all of the Pokemon in <em>BDSP</em> that learn the Mean Look move.</p>
<ul>
<li>Zubat (Learns at level 10) - Route 203, 204, 206, 207</li>
<li>Golbat (learns at level 1) - Evolves from Zubat at Level 22</li>
<li>Crobat (learns at level 1) - Evolves from Golbat with Friendship</li>
<li>Gastly (learns at level 8) - Route 209, Old Chateau, Lost Tower, Grand Underground</li>
<li>Haunter (learns at level 1) - Evolves from Gastly at level 25</li>
<li>Gengar (learns at level 1) - Trade Haunter</li>
<li>Smoochum (learns at level 40) - Lake Acuity, Grand Underground</li>
<li>Jynx (learns at level 46) - Evolves from Smoochum at level 30</li>
<li>Umbreon (learns at level 50) - Evolves from Eevee (Increase happiness during night)</li>
<li>Murkrow (learns at level 41) - Eterna Forest, Lost Tower, Grand Underground (Brilliant Diamond exclusive)</li>
<li>Honchkrow (learns at level 1) - Evolves from Murkrow with Dusk Stone</li>
<li>Misdreavus (learns at level 19) - Eterna Forest, Lost Tower, Grand Underground (Shining Pearl exclusive)</li>
<li>Mismagius (learns at level 1) - Evolve Misdreavus with Dusk Stone</li>
<li>Sableye (learn at level 36) - Grand Underground (Shining Pearl exclusive)</li>
<li>Duskull (learns at level 28) - Route 224, Grand Underground</li>
<li>Dusclops (learns at level 28) - Evolves from Duskull at level 37</li>
<li>Dusknoir (learns at level 28) - Trade Dusclops with Reaper Cloth</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pokemon BDSP Mean Look Uses</h2>
<p>Mean Look will prevent wild Pokemon from escaping, which can come in handy when it comes to trying to catch the three legendary Pokemon in <em>BDSP</em>, Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf. This makes Mean Look an essential move in your <em>Pokemon BDSP</em> party, even if you find a Pokemon just for catching these legendary Pokemon.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>As we get ready for <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> in 2022, players have noticed a sneaky Easter egg relating to Kratos, Atreus, and the series' long-awaited return to form.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>When 2018's <a rel="noopener" href="/god-of-war/" target="_blank" title="God of War"><em>God of War</em></a> released, Sony Santa Monica has a seemingly immeasurable task of reintroducing the Ghost of Sparta and making Kratos relevant for a whole new generation of fans. Added to this, there was a whole backstory to flesh out, with Atreus stepping up to the plate as a secondary protagonist. </p>
<h2>What's The Secret Hidden In Atreus' Scars?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/r5bls7/how_did_atreus_get_so_many_scars/" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<div class="artPost artReddit">
<blockquote class="reddit-card"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/r5bls7/how_did_atreus_get_so_many_scars/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">How did Atreus get so many scars?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/">GodofWar</a></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Posting on Reddit, u/LupusDeusMagnus asked how Atreus got so many scars despite his young age. There's a relatively simple answer, given that we see a bearded and brooding Kratos training his son to hunt like a <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/god-of-war-fans-hate-sonys-skinny-kratos-design/" target="_blank" title="God Of War Fans Hate Sony's Skinny Kratos Design">skinner version of his former self</a>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Delving deeper into the world of video game Easter eggs, others noted that one of Atreus' scars looks like Kratos red lightning bolt. One commenter wrote, "His scar on his left eye has the shape of Kratos‚Äôs eye tattoo. So to answer your question, most likely for plot relevance."</p>
<p>Remembering the big twist that Atreus is actually the Norse god Loki, someone else said, "I always thought it was just a nod to Loki mythos. I read Loki was scarred he was bound with a snake dripping venom on his face. He is described as almost disfigured having burnt skin and scars." </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>If you think it's just a coincidence, <em>God of War</em> Art Director Raf Grassetti has previously posted a picture of Atreus' face with a cryptic caption reading "birthmark". Over on his Instagram, he shared concept work for Atreus - where you can see his Kratos-inspired scar more clearly. </p>

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Questioning whether Atreus' potential family lineage could come into play in <em>Ragnarok</em> (or beyond), someone concluded, "Hmm so really it wasn‚Äôt Kratos or Deimos as being the 'marked one' the Olympians were warned about. It was really Atreus they were being warned about."</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>We don't know what's going on with the <em>God of War</em> mythos beyond <em>Ragnarok</em>, with confirmation we won't be getting <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/god-of-war-director-explains-why-there-wont-be-a-norse-trilogy/" target="_blank" title="God of War Director Explains Why There Won‚Äôt Be A Norse Trilogy">a trilogy in Norse mythology</a>. Then again, that doesn't necessarily mean Kratos has to die or the story will end here. </p>
<p>Personally, we'd like to see <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/god-of-war-fans-want-atreus-and-kratos-to-go-back-to-greece/" target="_blank" title="God Of War Fans Want Atreus And Kratos To Go Back To Greece">some sort of time travel adventure</a> or the story catapulting forward to an adult Atreus who has beefed up to become the new God of War - completely with a gnarly facial scar. With the <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-release/" target="_blank" title="God of War Ragnarok Release Suggests Cross-Gen Sequel"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em> release date</a> coming at some point in 2022, there hopefully isn't long to wait.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>The new <em>Apex Legends</em> Raiders Collection Event is scheduled to go live on December 7 and stick around until December 21.

Prepare to plunder some booty as we dive into all the details surrounding the <em>Apex Legends</em> Raiders Collection Event.</p>

<p>The holiday season marks the return of the fan-favourite Winter Express limited-time mode (LTM). This will be the third year in a row that the Winter Express makes an appearance over the winter months.</p>
<p>The Raiders Collection Event version of the Winter Express will include some minor changes to the game mode. In previous iterations of the Winter Express, a random loadout was assigned to each Legend per day. This time around, players will be able to handpick their loadout before boarding the train. This change will allow Winter Express fanatics to always pair the loadout of their choice with their desired Legend.</p>

<p>As is the case with every <em>Apex Legends</em> Collection Event, the Raiders CE will bring with it a slew of top-grade, themed cosmetics. Specifically, there are some brand-new Legendary skins for Valkyrie, Loba, Revenant, Bloodhound, Pathfinder, Wattson, and Wraith.</p>
<p>The <a href="/guides/apex-legends-revenant-abilities-ultimate-tips-lore/"><em>Apex Legends</em> Revenant</a> and Wattson Legendary skins look to be part of Store-exclusive bundles while the rest of the Legendary skins will be available in the actual Collection Event via special Raiders Apex Packs or as an individual purchase. Each Legend skin in the Raiders Collection Event also has a weapon skin that compliments it either in the collection or the prize track.</p>
<p>All in all, the Raiders Collection Event introduces 24 pirate-themed, limited-time cosmetics in total.</p>

<p>Hoping to collect some pirate treasure without spending any of your hard-earned gold? The Raiders Collection Event features a free prize track filled to the brim with free cosmetics. Inside the prize track, you'll find legend and weapon skins, weapon charms, trackers, and more.</p>
<p>You can earn 1,600 points per day toward the prize track and challenges refresh daily. This limited-time event also features stretch challenges that reward four unique badges if completed during the event.  Finally, all of the Raiders Collection Event challenges stack with the Battle Pass, so you can progress through both the prize track and your Battle Pass simultaneously.</p>

<p>The wait is finally over. <a href="/guides/apex-legends-wattson-abilities-ultimate-tips-lore/"><em>Apex Legends</em> Wattson</a>, the Static Defender originally released back in Season 2, now has her very own Heirloom. Players that collect all 24 Raiders collectables will receive Wattson's ‚ÄúEnergy Reader'' Heirloom. </p>

<p>Last but not least, the Raiders Collection Event will introduce some much-needed bug fixes, balance adjustments, and quality of life improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<p>Wattson, Ash, Valkyrie, and Revenant suffer from some unintentional issues that will be fixed in the coming update while various Arenas and miscellaneous bugs will also be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>Balance Adjustments</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to balance adjustments, Seer will receive a minor buff while Arc Stars, Splatter Rounds, and ammo crafting will be dealt slight nerfs with the release of the Raiders Collection Event.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Quality Of Life Improvements</strong></p>
<p>Along with some improvements to the Observer Mode in private matches, the Raiders Collection Event update will introduce a new Custom Reticle colour system as a major quality of life feature. This new system will allow<em> Apex Legends</em> players to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Select a colour from a list of recommended favourites</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Use the colour and brightness sliders to find the perfect colour</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Manually enter an RGB colour</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Toggle between 4 different hand-picked environments to preview your reticle</li>
</ul>
<p>The ability to change reticle colours has been a popular request dating back to <em>Apex Legends'</em> inception, so it's nice to see this system finally being implemented.</p>

<p>As we've shown time and time again with <a rel="noopener" href="/skyrim/" target="_blank" title="Skyrim"><em>Skyrim</em></a>, even 10 years of exploration doesn't mean we've found everything there is to uncover out there in Tamriel. Now, players might find themselves in a 'sticky' situation.</p>
<h2>What Is The NSFW Easter Egg In Skyrim?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/r75w6w/i_knew_rieklings_are_nasty_hoarders_but_i_didnt/" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
</div>
<p>Posting on the <em>Skyrim</em> Reddit, u/JRnalistic24 shared their shocking discovery that the scavenging Riekling might be partial to a bit of adult reading material. While exploring the Benkongerike, the player comes across a Riekling and their nest.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Here, there's the book called <em>The Lusty Argonian Maid</em> - which could give <em>50 Shades of Grey</em> a run for its money. If that wasn't enough, there's a linen wrap in the pile. We'll let you use your imagination when it comes to what that's for, but let's just say, the comments paint a pretty vivid picture for you. </p>
<p>One wrote, "Bruh I saw that pile, thought it was funny but left it alone. Now I gotta go back and get telekinesis." Another added, "I ain't touching that pile to get to the spell tome, no sir," while a third said, "Yeah those pages must be mostly concrete at this point."</p>
<p>Our favourite jokes include, "One-handed skill has increased to 100" and "The ol wack shack." It's definitely better than that <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/tomb-raider-devs-discuss-naked-lara-croft-easter-egg/" target="_blank" title="Tomb Raider Devs Discuss Naked Lara Croft Easter Egg">rumoured Nuder Raider Easter egg</a>.</p>

<p>We don't know whether the NSFW <em>Skyrim </em>Easter egg was supposed to be or not, but it's pretty suspicious if not. Although most NSFW video games will simply label themselves as that, others will slip in the odd adult Easter egg and make you get sweaty looking for it.</p>
<p>The most famous is <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>' Hot Coffee, but did you know there's a level in <em>Kirby's Dream Land 2</em> where you float into the crotch of a naked woman, or that you can make an alien woman's boobs grow in <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Going Commando</em> simply by doing backflips?</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, the reveal of horny Riekling on Main comes after <a rel="noopener" href="/world-of-warcraft/" target="_blank" title="WoW"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a> has vowed to clean up its act. With Activision Blizzard in a quagmire of legal troubles amidst reports of <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/nintendo-boss-discusses-disturbing-activision-blizzard-claims/" target="_blank" title="Nintendo Boss Discusses 'Disturbing' Activision Blizzard Claims">sexual harassment and misogyny</a>, <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/world-of-warcraft-dials-back-sexual-content-in-game/" target="_blank" title="World Of Warcraft Dials Back Sexual Content In-Game"><em>WoW </em>started censoring some of its in-game artwork</a>. </p>
<p>Remembering that the Riekling get their power from gathering together in big groups to take on the Dragonborn, has the OP stumbled on a secret <em>Skyrim</em> orgy? Well, as someone pointed out on Reddit, "Benkongerike" means "Kingdom of Bones" in Norwegian.</p>

<p>For longer than we care to remember, these two gaming giants have duked it out. Although there are still critics of Game Pass‚Äô business model because it is accused of giving away it‚Äôs biggest games for "free", you only have to look at the number of <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/playstation-plus-is-officially-losing-the-battle-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" title="PlayStation Plus Is Officially Losing the Battle To Game Pass">Game Pass subscribers</a> to see it works. </p>
<h2>What Is The PlayStation Game Pass?</h2>

</div>
<p>According to trusted leaker Nibellion (via <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>), Sony has admitted defeat by adopting a similar tactic to its biggest rival. Come on, even Nintendo has its Switch Online service to get us parting with our coins to play N64 games. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Apparently, Sony's version is called Project Spartacus (we're guessing this isn‚Äôt the final name) and will be split into three tiers. It'll work similar to the basic and Utimate versions of Game Pass, and like this, there's a push from Sony into Cloud Gaming</p>
<h2>What‚Äôs Included In The PlayStation Game Pass?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/savespectspidey/status/1466826786772242435?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>Tier 1 is set to include PS Plus membership and a mysterious mention of "benefits". Tier 2 package will open the doors to PS4 games and "select" PS5 titles. Tier 3 will presumably cost a little more but add backward compatibility to fan-favourites from the PS3, PS2, and PS1 eras. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The icing on the cake is that Sony will reportedly merge the PS Plus and PS Now services. For too long, we've been left confused by what each actually does - with one billed for mainstream gamers and the other for multiplayer.</p>
<p>Everything is pretty vague though, and we're also not liking the sound of "select PS5" games. It hardly sounds like <a rel="noopener" href="/god-of-war/" target="_blank" title="God of War"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a> will be landing on the PlayStation Game Pass anytime soon. </p>

</div>
<p>We have heard about a <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/playstation-game-pass/" target="_blank" title="Sony Hints At PlayStation Equivalent Of Xbox Game Pass">Sony version of the Game Pass before</a>, but it jars against the words of former PlayStation CEO Shawn Layden, who called out <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/playstation-ceo-game-pass/" target="_blank" title="Former PlayStation CEO Calls Xbox Game Pass ‚ÄòUnsustainable‚Äô">Microsoft's model as "unsustainable"</a>.  For those hoping to know more, the upcoming Game Awards could be one to watch. </p>

            <![CDATA[<p><em>Call of Duty</em> has been ironing out its cheating problem over the last month, and while <em>Warzone</em> is awaiting its induction to the Ricochet anti-cheat measures, it still lingers there.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>However, with <a rel="noopener" href="/vanguard/" target="_blank" title="Vanguard"><em>Vanguard</em></a> already putting the anti-cheat to good use, the sum of players engaging with hacks seems drastically halted. Thank goodness for that.</p>
<p>As a result, gamers are looking for in-game exploits to give them the edge. And, irritatingly, they've found one.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>

<h2>Vanguard Players Find Sub Pen Exploit</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODVanguard/comments/r6cbtb/watch_out_for_this_one_on_sub_pens/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
</div>
<p><em>Call of Duty </em>players have identified a bug that has let cheaters breach the parameters of regular maps and leave the playfield entirely - giving them the opportunity to score easy kills.</p>
<p>The bug can be found on Sub Pens, which is the remake of the map from <em>World at War</em>. The <em>Vanguard</em> Sub Pens gltich is letting players camp outside of the map and kill others while unable to be killed themselves.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>A video showing the glitch was posted to the CODVanguard subreddit, showing a player rushing into battle before getting killed by a spray of bullets - but the killcam reveals that the player that killed them is firing from an elevated position surrounded by missing game textures.</p>
<p>It definitely implies that the killer is out of bounds and reminds of us the time you were unable to <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/call-of-duty-glitch-allows-players-to-hide-under-the-prison/" target="_blank" title=" Call Of Duty: Warzone Glitch Allows Players To Hide Under The Prison">clip under the map in <em>Warzone</em></a>. It's frustrating that players are already cheating their way out of bounds, so fans have made their anger known.</p>
<h2>Fans React To Sub Pens Exploit</h2>
<p><img src="/media/kcgbnidu/sub-pen-vanguard.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Sub Pen Call of Duty Vanguard" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Fans have sounded off in the comments on the post, and as you can expect, they're not best pleased. "What a dweeb", user simelydaxanman puts so eloquently. "Yeah, he's just a sucker with no self esteem," replied MohWarfighter.</p>
<p>"I've seen two other locations on Sub Pens where players can get to certain inaccessible catwalks, one being next to that pipe you mention and other being on the other end of the map," commented Grand_Ian. "Hopefully they fix these areas when season 1 comes out."</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>It's frustrating that this bug (and others, according to this comment) is still present in the game - here's hoping it gets patched out son, otherwise every game on Sub Pens could be jeopardized by cheaters.</p>
<p>Sledghammer will likely try and patch out the ability to slip through the net on Sub Pens, but knowing <em>Call of Duty </em>players, they'll be taking the opportunity to make the most of this exploit as soon as they can.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>There are certain things we've come to expect from high-concept sci-fi these days. We've seen much of it all before, with simple space travel, easily discernible races of aliens, even broad allegorical rejections of war taking centre stage in many of the space-faring adventures on the market. The likes of <a href="/mass-effect-4/" title="Mass Effect 4"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> and <a href="/the-outer-worlds-2/" title="The Outer Worlds 2"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a> often fall back on this, and even the upcoming <a href="/starfield/" title="Starfield"><em>Starfield</em></a> looks to carry the torch for the sci-fi games we know. But some games are ready to change that.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Enter <em>Solar Ash</em>, the first outing by indie developer Heart Machine since 2016's <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>. Since its gameplay reveal during a <a href="/playstation-5/" title="Playstation">PlayStation</a> State Of Play conference earlier this year, the game looked to be a curious title that carried a lot on its shoulders - namely a movement system that would have to be perfect to avoid scrutiny, and a story that far exceeds even the grandest blockbuster titles in scope. Plus, a pushed back release date cast doubt over the game's final release. Heart Machine's ability to manage it was brought into question pretty quickly - but the game proves we never had any reason to doubt.</p>
<h2>I Wanna Voidrun To You</h2>
<p><img src="/media/i20nn20m/grapple.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Solar Ash Review" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p><em>Solar Ash </em>follows Rei, a Voidrunner on a mission to traverse a black hole filled to burst with sinister and evil beasts. This is all in a bid to activate the colossal and infinitely dangerous Starseed, a device that can alter the flow of time, in order to save her home planet from destruction. As you skate across the cloud-borne landscapes of the black hole in order to take down the looming behemoths known only as Remnants, and as the mysterious Echo threatens your goal, <em>Solar Ash </em>gradually unravels to suggest that, maybe, your journey could cost more than you'd ever expected.</p>
<p>The game is immediately recognisable thanks to its incredible art style that blasts the players with incredible contrasts and colours, making the supposedly dead surroundings feel like they're fighting back against decay. The disorder of the world is stunning, and the way it visualises some of its more avant-garde ideas makes every concept feel like it belongs on the landscape battered by mysterious forces. This style defies any traditional presentation of the genre and makes <em>Solar Ash </em>feel truly unique on the surface alone - but it runs so much deeper than that.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Starseed Gazing</h2>
<p><img src="/media/4w1jn5jv/remnant-attack.png?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Solar Ash Review" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>The game's peculiar narrative takes a lot of beats from the strange and sinister, turning it into a cocktail of ideas that is truly unlike anything else. The huge and deeply unsettling Remnants seem to take beats of visual influence from the likes of <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion </em>and <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, and its slick, spry movement and rail-grinding feature have the zip and pep of <em>Jet Set Radio</em>. Each of these elements come together to create a game that feels grand in its scope, and uses this to intentionally make Rei's journey intensely lonely.</p>
<p><em>Solar Ash</em> is a cold and eerie game that forces introspection, but many games of its kin often forget to be fun in the process. This game does no such thing; movement is deeply satisfying, using momentum and shifting gravity to keep you skating smoothly, and letting you hit a huge speed boost whenever you like. It's this freedom that makes <em>Solar Ash</em>'s atmosphere so impressive, giving you all the tools to do anything you like from the moment you crash land, but never holding your hand as you do so.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The game practically leaves the player to their own devices, forcing them to figure everything out as they go. This can be a blessing and a curse, with each puzzle you complete swiftly feeling all the more satisfying, but leaving the tougher ones with a bitter wish that the game had helped just a little more.</p>
<h2>Kaijooze</h2>
<p><img src="/media/qpqd43lo/echo.jpg?width=500&amp;height=285.4166666666667" alt="Solar Ash Review" width="500" height="285.4166666666667" data-caption=""></p>
<p><em>Solar Ash</em>'s most fun feature, though, is allowing the player to take on the Remnants - huge hulking beasts that stand between you and the activation of the Starseed. You'll have to deal with at portions of ooze around their section of the game's map to get to them, chipping away at ethereal pins that protrude during speedy traversal puzzles. These are exhilarating for the most part, but the Remnants are the stars of the show - you'll hook onto one soft spot on the beast's body and dash around on them, chipping away at gaps in their bone-like armour in order to topple them.</p>
<p>Much like <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, taking these monstrous foes down is tough and with very little margin for error. The game's speedy skating mechanics will make you feel truly unstoppable in the process though, and when the monster has fallen, you'll be itching to handle the next one.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>More interesting still is what comes afterwards - every defeated Remnant comes with a conversation with the mysterious Echo, a pure-white ethereal being who questions your intentions and implies that you only really know half of the story of your planet's imminent destruction. Though each encounter with her will deplete a portion of your upgradable health every time, the real damage she does is to your understanding of the game's narrative, plunging you into an uncertainty that only makes the stunning world feel more isolated.</p>
<p>It's a genius implementation that tackles the player's psyche to amplify the game's core themes, and it all comes together in a breathtaking climax that answers every question you didn't realise you were asking yourself. Every moment leading up to <em>Solar Ash</em>'s finale coalesce in a final encounter that blew me away and left my jaw hanging open - an absolute firework of emotion that goes off with an introspective message rarely approached in the genre.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>A Galactic Triumph</h2>
<p><em>Solar Ash </em>combines complex ideas with simple and exciting gameplay in a way that few games are able to, and the final product is nothing short of remarkable. The visual style and soundtrack create the atmosphere, and the excellent writing of Rei and her journey use it to tell a story of grief, and how we can use it to build something better.</p>
<p>Heart Machine's passion is clear, and <em>Solar Ash </em>is a triumph that manages to be incredibly fun despite its deeply emotional core. The game's world may be cold and unfeeling on the surface, but that'll only make you want to connect with it more. <em>Solar Ash</em> is an example of Heart Machine's exciting, compelling, lightning-in-a-bottle brilliance, and more than deserves to be considered among 2021's greatest games.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>A 3rd person space shooter in the vein of Everspace or Freelancer, Chorus attempts to have the slick, visceral space combat of a space flight sim while also telling a genuine story about the effects of guilt. This is a genre with very few strong entries, so the semi-open world and 10+ hour story campaign are promising features, if executed correctly. Exploring the galaxy, finding upgrades for your ship, completing side missions and honing your skills as a fighter pilot are all part of the package, but how well does the game live up to its potential as a narrative-focused space opera?</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<h2>I‚Äôve Got A Bad Feeling About This</h2>
<p><img src="/media/yknd5osx/chorus-review-one.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Chorus review: I've got a bad feeling about this" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Chorus sees you take control of Nara, along with her sentient spaceship, Forsaken. Nara was once an elite pilot and religious zealot for the Circle but is now living in exile attempting to deal with the guilt she feels for her past actions. Unfortunately, the game doesn‚Äôt tackle this element effectively and most of the story beats ultimately fall flat. The character of Nara is decent enough, the problem is that she never interacts with any other characters, Forsaken aside.</p>
<p>There is a moment early on when a character sacrifices themselves and the game attempts to play it as a very serious heartfelt moment... except this character is never actually seen in person and Nara‚Äôs limited interactions with them were over the radio. As a result, this scene completely misses the mark and comes across as laughable. This problem extends to the rest of the characters too; the only time you interact with them is by flying over to their ship and speaking via radio. A small picture of the person pops up in the bottom right, a mechanic also used by indie-cyberpunk game <em>Cloudpunk</em>, but where that succeeded in giving the characters emotion and feeling, <em>Chorus </em>fails to replicate it.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Another element that landed flat on its face is the whispery inner monologue Nera is plagued by, a la <em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>. Thanks to it never actually adding anything that isn't immediately obvious from the context of the story, it was an annoying background noise more often than not.</p>
<p>The best and only real character moments are between Nara and Forsaken, a dynamic similar to BT from <em>Titanfall 2 </em>or Camus from the aforementioned <em>Cloudpunk</em>. However, Forsaken is nowhere near as likeable or memorable. Instead, he is mostly relegated to being a force in Nara‚Äôs ear telling her that she ‚Äúcan do this‚Äù and to ‚Äúbe true to yourself‚Äù. There was an attempt to create an interesting dynamic between the two, with Forsaken being (rightfully) annoyed at being left to collect dust for the seven years Nara was in hiding, but this dynamic extends to a single mission with one cutscene before being promptly forgotten for the most part, aside from a final climactic moment that was too little, too late.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>I Feel The Need, The Need For Speed</h2>
<p><img src="/media/oa3nxghr/chorus-review-five.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Chorus review: I feel the need, the need for speed" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p><em>Chorus</em> features responsive, albeit limited, flight controls that anyone should be able to pick up fairly easily - you can aim your fighter and control the speed you are travelling, but you cannot roll the fighter or use thrusters to adjust the position of your craft laterally or vertically. As a result, those looking for a more in-depth space shooter like <em>Elite Dangerous</em> or <em>Star Citizen</em> should look elsewhere because this has favoured arcade-style flight mechanics over being too complex.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, Nara regains access to her ‚ÄúRites‚Äù, a number of special powers that allow her to channel energies from the aether to change reality around her, which start to spice up the flight and combat mechanics, but since they're not available from the get-go, it's slow going for a while. For example, once unlocked, you can use the Rite of Hunt as a teleport to get behind enemy ships or the Rite of the Star to blast forward like a shooting star destroying all those in your path.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Three weapon types are available: Gatling guns (used to take down a ship‚Äôs hull), lasers (used to take down a ship‚Äôs shields), and missiles (used to take down a ship‚Äôs armour). While different versions of these weapons can be unlocked and upgraded throughout the game, you're only ever limited to these three weapon types, which feels limiting given the far-future sci-fi possibilities that could be explored. Again, Nara‚Äôs Rites do make up for this somewhat as a few of the Rites can be used offensively, but the lack of weapon diversity still leaves you wanting more.<br><br>Combine the piloting, powers, and unlockable weapons together and you reach the point where <em>Chorus</em> shines. It takes some time to reach that though, thanks to not having most of the Rites available from the start. You can always employ the same strategy for foes too, no matter which type you're against: shoot them in the face. Alternate methods to dispose of enemies would help prevent the combat from getting stale, alas it's not to be.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Upgrades, People, Upgrades</h2>
<p><img src="/media/oniiia4l/chorus-review-seven.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Chorus review: Upgrades, people, upgrades" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>It wouldn't be a true space game without the ability to upgrade your ship and in <em>Chorus</em>, these modifications come by completing missions or purchasing them from hangars. Finding entire sets of mods for significant stat bonuses can be worth it, but outside of these, the benefits are fairly small: a 5% buff here, 10% reduction there, etc. Most of the power growth in the game comes from the new weapons and Rites you can find, along with mastery challenges such as destroying a certain number of enemies with a specific weapon. In return, you'll receive a permanent boost to your stats.</p>
<p>You won't find any cosmetics to equip on your ship though, despite there being so many gameplay modifications available. You can't unlock liveries, paintjobs, or anything of the sort, so you'll be stuck with the colour of your cold, hard metal. Thankfully, the game does look gorgeous, with detailed textures and impressive skyboxes, so maybe it's a good thing there aren't any flashy liveries to detract from the space atmosphere.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Visually, the most impressive parts are the cutscenes, though they're few and far between and tend to only focus on Nara. With that in mind, the voice actor does a fantastic job at carrying the dialogue, which is something that can't be said for the rest of the cast, or the audio in general. Epic space battles should come with a certain amount of oomph, which <em>Chorus </em>is completely lacking.</p>
<h2>Mechanically Sound, Narratively Lacklustre</h2>
<p><em><img src="/media/shcflwt0/chorus-review-six.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Chorus review: Mechanically sound, narratively lacklustre" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></em></p>
<p><em>Chorus</em> offers a fairly middling take on a space combat shooter. The gameplay is really where Chorus shines, when you combine piloting, powers, and weapons in just the right way, you can reach a sweet spot that makes the game a delight to play. It just takes too long to reach this point, so you'll likely lose interest before then. If you enjoy space flight games there is almost certainly something here for you to enjoy as the minute to minute action in Chorus is mechanically sound, it's just been done better elsewhere (see: <em>Elite Dangerous</em>, <em>Everspace 2</em>). The real shame of <em>Chorus</em> is that the story can‚Äôt match the excitement of the gameplay. Lacking any real characters, the game relies on Nara and Forsaken, and unfortunately, their dynamic is so underdeveloped that it makes the climax of the game feel undeserved. Nara‚Äôs journey to overcome her guilt is an interesting one, however, the game doesn‚Äôt do enough to capitalise on the promising premise.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Since the creation of <em>League of Legends </em>as an esport, the <a href="/league-of-legends/" title="LOL"><em>League of Legends</em></a> Championship Series (LCS) hasn‚Äôt necessarily been the prime example of having good coaching. In reality, coaches are hard to come by, there aren‚Äôt many people who are both knowledgeable of the game while also containing leadership qualities that allow for level-headed discussion and delegation. That‚Äôs where Golden Guardians‚Äô hiring of five assistant coaches - all position-specific - on top of already having a head coach comes as a surprise.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>In a league that really made its first serious attempts at coaching when it decided to bring together the expertise and knowledge of what it takes to be a leading coach from a more traditional sports background, with an analyst type to give the Xs and Os, it has come a long way. </p>
<p><img src="/media/eojecqk4/lcs-mainstays.jpg?width=500&amp;height=332.51953125" alt="Image via Riot Games" width="500" height="332.51953125" data-caption="Image via Riot Games"></p>
<p>Past this sort of short-lived coaching era, a more natural one came to fruition. One that saw the LCS have tenured coaches that have put in their work in several regions, be it in the West with Europe and North America, or in the East with China and Korea. There is also what has become more of the norm in players turning into coaches. This has allowed for a stronger foundation for players to lean their backs on when the going gets rough as well it‚Äôs allowed them to focus more on the individualistic aspects of the game. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>There have been many successful coaches in the North American scene. One can point out numerous specifically. For starters, one player who could be considered one of the most successful in the LCS specifically is Bok "<strong>Repeared</strong>" Han-gyu. He performed wonders over at Cloud9, and has proven his ability to replicate success now in 100 Thieves. He came in as a finishing move for the Thieves to complete their LCS summer split heist of winning their first championship. The league can also look at region-native coaches such as Anthony "<strong>Zikz</strong>" Gray and Parth "<strong>Parth</strong>" Naidu, who have brought in several LCS titles themselves on Counter Logic Gaming and Team SoloMid, respectively.</p>
<p>The LCS can also add the likes of Europe getting Peter Dun for Evil Geniuses and Andre "<strong>Guilhoto</strong>" Pereira Guilhoto, who now will coach the upcoming Team Liquid superteam. This doesn‚Äôt mean that LCS watchers shouldn‚Äôt forget about the newer, maybe lesser-known coaches such as Golden Guardian‚Äôs Nicholas "<strong>Inero</strong>" Smith who after a poor start to the spring was able to help mould a newer roster come summer.</p>

<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The evolution in coaching has continued, with the aforementioned Golden Guardian‚Äôs coaching staff of one head coach and five role-specific coaches. Something that has never been seen before in the league.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, there will be coaches to help every single player in the roster. Brandon "<strong>Swip3R</strong>" Holland for top lane, Samuel "<strong>Spookz</strong>" Broadley for jungle, Aaron "<strong>ChuChuz</strong>" for mid-lane, former starting ADC for the team Trevor "<strong>Stixxay</strong>" Hayes for ADC and Morgan "<strong>Hustling</strong>" Granberg for support. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>This coaching style is far from the norm, especially for a league like the LCS, but it‚Äôs very welcomed. In a now franchised league as of 2018, risks like these are more than welcome, especially for an organisation that hasn‚Äôt necessarily performed amongst the top apart from the 2020 summer roster that ended up under 100 Thieves‚Äô contracts. </p>
<p>Whether it‚Äôll work, that‚Äôs up for time to decide. In the end, attempts like these are only good for the league. Learning can be had, and who knows, if it ends up working this could be a severe shift in how coaching works. </p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Despite its surprise release, <em>Halo Infinite</em> has stolen the show in a year where the franchise is going up against the likes of <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> for the first time in several years. Thanks to 343 Industries going back to basics and adding small, yet hugely impactful innovations that change how the game is played, <a href="/halo/" title="Halo"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> has been a huge success with hundreds of thousands of players dropping into matches on a regular basis. The switch to a free-to-play model has opened up the <em>Halo</em> franchise to a whole new base of players and despite the best efforts of Sledgehammer Games and DICE, 343 seems to have hit the jackpot in the highly competitive first-person shooter market. But why has <em>Infinite</em> been so well-received from players and fans?</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<h2>Catering For All</h2>
<p><img src="/media/nqxpzza1/1eef45f9-5d47-468d-9718-18b8f2b071e5.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.1111111111111" alt="" width="500" height="281.1111111111111" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Whether you‚Äôre a fan of Big Team Battle or you want to get your fix of competitive action, <em>Infinite</em> offers various options for players of all skill levels, making it hugely accessible even for those that may not have plenty of time to sink into the game. Big Team Battle isn‚Äôt for everyone, which is where Ranked Arena comes into its own. Featuring a dedicated ranking system alongside the maps and game modes used in the<em> Halo Championship Series</em> (HCS), players have flocked to the playlist and have showered it with plenty of praise, with many expressing their frustrations surrounding <em>Call of Duty</em>‚Äôs lack of ranked playlist at launch.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>In comparison to its rivals, <em>343</em> has done an amazing job to cater to the entire base of players without compromising on smaller features that other franchises have chosen to ignore until a later date. As the seasons progress, new features are likely to be added, and if the developer can keep this level of balance across all areas of multiplayer, The popularity of <em>Infinite</em> and its huge esports resurgence will show no signs of slowing down anytime soon.</p>
<h2>Constant Developer Communication</h2>
<p>Although the launch of <em>Infinite</em> was delayed by a year, there are a few changes that have come to the attention of the community and were extremely quick to share their opinions. Slow Battle Pass progression has been one of the main talking points and just weeks since the game was released, <em>343 Industries</em> has already confirmed that improvements to the feature are already in the works, much to the approval of those struggling to work their way through the tiers of content.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Compared to <a href="/vanguard/" title="Vanguard"><em>Call of Duty Vanguard</em></a>, a triple-A title that may have benefitted from a delay, players can shoot through huge structures of the map and determine the location of an opponent that‚Äôs hidden behind cover thanks to ridiculously strong levels of aim assist.</p>
<p>While<em> Halo</em> players are receiving regular developer communication, <em>Call of Duty</em> players are still being left in the dark when it comes to any information on how<em> Vanguard</em>‚Äôs major flaws will be addressed. It‚Äôs no surprise as to why so many <em>Call of Duty</em> players have jumped ship to join the Master Chief.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Easy To Play, Difficult To Master</h2>
<p><img src="/media/urxkjpey/halo-infinite.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p><em>Infinite</em>‚Äôs core mechanics are marginally different from previous entries into the <em>Halo</em> franchise, which is great for seasoned veterans and for those jumping into the action for the very first time. While it‚Äôs relatively straightforward to unleash a barrage of gunfire from the barrel of the Assault Rifle, there are numerous elements of the game that can take more time to understand and master. Timings on power weapons, Active Camo, and Overshields are a crucial area of the competitive game to master, as these items can turn the tide of a match in a matter of seconds. Once you get familiar with the timings of these key items, coordination and map positioning in a bid to secure control makes it much easier to achieve victory. </p>
<p>It may take some time for newer players to master some of the mechanics that have been a staple of the <em>Halo</em> series for years, but once things click into place, Infinite is a hugely enjoyable game whether it‚Äôs the all-out chaos of a Big Team Battle or a strategic Capture the Flag battle on Ranked Arena.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Very Few Flaws</h2>
<p>Perhaps the biggest factor as to why <em>Halo Infinite</em> has been so well-received is the lack of bugs and glitches that have been discovered since it launched. More often than not, the opening weeks after launch are a time when numerous problems emerge, but other than the slow XP progression, there have been minimal issues within the game, much to the delight of fans.</p>
<p>As one of the smoothest and balanced first-person shooters currently available, the sky is the limit for <em>Halo Infinite</em> as its rivals attempt to claw back the ground it has lost to one of the most polished shooters to release in 2021.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>PS Plus free games are a lovely gesture. To offer players free titles to tinker with every month simply for being subscribed to the service, on top of the legacy games you get for free, is a great bonus that makes it stand out.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>But, in recent months, fans haven't been entirely convinced by the game choices. Back when the <a href="/playstation-5/" title="Playstation">PS5</a> first launched, the exclusives on offer like <a href="/articles/bugsnax-darker-ending/" title="Bugsnax Devs Tease A ‚ÄòMuch Darker‚Äô Ending For The Game "><em>Bugsnax</em></a> and <em>Destruction All-Stars </em>got players excited for the burgeoning new generation of gaming, but it has somewhat petered out over the last few months.</p>
<p>Especially now - as a new game arrives - players have a lot of reasons to be upset with its addition to the service.</p>

<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The version of the game, titled <em>Godfall: Challenger Edition</em>, only comes with the title's endgame content - the Lightbringer, Dreamstones and Ascended Tower of Trials modes. The story mode is arguably the leading draw of the game, but is locked away behind the Deluxe edition upgrade of the game, along with its Fire &amp; Darkness DLC.</p>
<p>The Challenger Edition has confused a lot of fans, as restricting players exclusively to content that comes after the main game doesn't really give us much of a reason to engage - let alone buy the deluxe upgrade they're trying to flog with this model.</p>

<h2>Gamers React To Godfall's PS Plus Release</h2>
<p>Fans have reacted to the game's peculiar structure of release, and they're pretty confused about how most of the already underwhelming title simply won't appear in the PS Plus build.</p>

<p>It's a strange choice for sure, and we're not sure many fans will see much reason to upgrade to the deluxe edition of the game as the move suggests it's trying on - but we'll just have to wait and see. Who knows - upgrades could end up selling like hotcakes thanks to a PS Plus push.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Wondering how to make Terracotta in <em>Minecraft? <a href="/minecraft/" title="Minecraft">Minecraft </a></em>is filled to the brim with various recipes, and not all of them are clear in how to craft them, or what they are even for. However, we've got the lowdown on everything you need to know about this decorative block, including recipes and uses. Here's how to make Terracotta in <em>Minecraft. </em></p>

<h2>How To Make Terracotta In Minecraft: What Is Terracotta?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/uvmg2x1m/how-to-make-terracotta-in-minecraft-2.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Terracotta in Minecraft." width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Before getting into how to make Terracotta in <em>Minecraft,</em> you first have to understand why you should be making it at all. While many aspects of the game serve some kind of practical purpose, terracotta is actually just a decorative element. It is a hardened clay that maintains the same level of blast resistance as stone, yet can be all the more colourful. Terracotta can be dyed into one of sixteen different colours, which will help make your building projects stand out. </p>

<p>Now onto how to make Terracotta in <em>Minecraft, </em>and for this you are going to need some coal and a block of clay. Open up your furnace menu, where you must place the coal (or any other applicable fuel source) in the lower place. That of course means that the block of clay can be placed in the top spot. Keep your furnace menu open while the clay is steadily burned. Now that the block of clay has been properly smelted in the furnace, you will have produced Terracotta, which you must place in your inventory to complete the process. That's how to make Terracotta in <em>Minecraft</em>. </p>
<p>As an addition, Terracotta can actually be found in some areas like the Badland Biomes, desert pyramids, and even warm underwater ruins, although all will differ in colour.</p>

<p>Moving past how to make Terracotta in <em>Minecraft, </em>and onto how to dye Terracotta. Sometimes you just want to add a bit of colour to your projects, and Terracotta is the way to do it. But how do you change the colour of this hardened clay block? There is a pretty simple solution to this. Head into the crafting menu, where you will see a 3x3 grid. Place your preferred colour dye in the middle, whether that be cyan, pink, or lime, and then surround the remaining eight slots with your Terracotta blocks. This will then produce eight coloured Terracotta blocks.</p>

            <![CDATA[<p><em>League of Legends </em>Championship Series (LCS) offseasons are never a dull moment. From the moment All-Star American ADC Yiliang "<strong>Doublelift</strong>" Peng left Counter Logic Gaming to join rivals Team SoloMid going into Season 6, to last year‚Äôs mighty offseason that saw the likes of Luka ‚Äú<strong>Perkz</strong>‚Äù Perkovic and Hu ‚Äú<strong>SwordArt</strong>‚Äù Shuo-Chieh join the league. It will be an ongoing law for as long as <a href="/league-of-legends/" title="LOL"><em>League of Legends</em></a> exists, and this year it was no different.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>LCS offseasons usually have their wow moments, no matter how big or small. As sort of a preamble to what was going to be one of the most different LCS formats to date, the offseason going into the 2021 season was one for the LCS history books that started off with retirements from the region‚Äôs most historic players in Soren "<strong>Bjergsen"</strong> Bjerg and Doublelift. This change was followed up with nearly half of the league‚Äôs players from 2019 not returning for this same season in what was a<a href="/articles/a-significant-change-of-faces-for-the-lcs-a-noteworthy-turnover/"> noteworthy turnover for the LCS</a>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/LCSOfficial/status/1331745197621821442?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>All of these changes combined lent itself to a very exciting season that although continued to show the<a href="/articles/the-continuing-gap-between-the-two-halves-of-the-lcs/"> gap between the top and bottom halves of the league</a>, also introduced another new champion in the form of <a href="#" title="100 Thieves" data-anchor="#">100 Thieves</a>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>This past offseason continued the trend to turn heads, as even though it hasn‚Äôt contained any big signings or transfers - apart from <a href="/articles/bjergsen-joins-team-liquid-start-of-new-era/">Bjergsen‚Äôs return to pro-play and signing to Team Liquid</a> - it still had its own take on it. This take was its lack of mercy, in the form of leaving what many think are players that can certainly still make an impact on the league.</p>
<p>As of this time of writing, there are multiple players that just a few seasons ago - especially last season - could be considered highly sought after pieces to any roster. Players like mid-laner Daniele "<strong>Jiizuke</strong>" di Mauro who, although when he first joined the league wasn‚Äôt up to snuff, managed to play at an MVP candidate level in this past season‚Äôs summer split when given a second chance. There‚Äôs also veteran jungler who‚Äôs been a part of various successful rosters in Dennis "<strong>Svenskeren" </strong>Johnsen who has also <a href="https://twitter.com/Svenskeren1/status/1464638768695197696">not been able to find a team</a>. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Hell0, I want to announce I will be teamless for 2022.<br />This offseason was a clownfiesta sadly especially for midlaners,it is what it is.<br />I will be playing/streaming in January from EU/KR to keep my level up and be ready in case opportunities rise in spring/summer.</p>

</div>
<p>That‚Äôs not all, as veterans such as ADC Liyu "<strong>Cody Sun</strong>" Sun, jungler Mads "<strong>Broxah</strong>" Brock-Pedersen, support Andy "<strong>Smoothie</strong>" Ta, and many others have also been left without a team. One could also count the likes of newer players that managed to make a name for themselves this past season in mid-laner Max "<strong>Soligo</strong>" Soong and support David "<strong>Diamond</strong>" Berube and the like. The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>This 'leaving out' of players marks a new change in the LCS. You still have the big spenders in teams like Team Liquid with their signing of top laner Gabriel "<strong>Bwipo</strong>" Rau, ADC Steven "<strong>Hans sama</strong>" Liv and, of course, Bjergsen while keeping jungler Lucas "<strong>Santorin</strong>" Larsen and multiple-time MVP support, Jo "<strong>CoreJJ</strong>" Yong-in. But now teams have shifted into younger rosters and in many ways - what is to be the general thought around the league - <em>cheaper</em> rosters. Or 100 Thieves, who have kept their championship-winning roster while adding <a href="https://twitter.com/100T_Esports/status/1466120366066003972">another assistant coach</a>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>You have teams like a Cloud9 who have always managed to pull whatever it is off, be it making it past the group stage when they make Worlds, or introducing new raw home-grown talent, making the organisation a <a href="/articles/cloud9-never-settles-a-paragon-in-the-lcs/">paragon of the LCS</a>. Or teams like Golden Guardians who continue to build small while also making outstanding movements in the coaching department. </p>

<p>It‚Äôll be one of the most different LCS seasons to date. Considering the past seasons as a changing of the mantle, or a transition between old and new. One could consider this upcoming season a heightened continuation of that. This continuation will be very interesting as opposed to past seasons where there were a number of clear favourites among the top, this time around that isn‚Äôt guaranteed. </p>

            <![CDATA[<p>Uh-oh. Things have got off to a bumpy start for Ludwig, as after only three days of setting up shop on YouTube, the streamer ended up getting banned and the reason why is pretty hilarious. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>On November 29, Ludwig "<strong>Ludwig</strong>" Ahgren sparked fireworks across the streaming community when he announced <a href="/articles/ludwig-officially-announces-move-to-youtube/" title="Ludwig Officially Announces Move To YouTube">he was leaving Twitch to join YouTube Gaming</a> via a cinematic, metaphor-fuelled video. The move was met with support and excitement from both his fans and fellow streamers. Twitch even sent its congratulations and wished him the best for the future.</p>
<p>Following the move, Ludwig promised some exciting things to come, including '<a href="/articles/ludwig-biggest-smash-bros-tournament-ever/" title="Ludwig Promises To Host 'Biggest Smash Bros. Tournament' Ever">the biggest Smash Bros. tournament ever'</a>. However, barely three days into moving to YouTube, Ludwig got banned from the streaming platform. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Why Was Ludwig Banned From YouTube?</h2>
<p>Posting a video on his channel Mogul Mail, Ludwig explained that in one of his recent streams he was doing a rundown of the "50 most classic, greatest, vintage YouTube videos of all time". Sure enough, it wasn't long before 'Baby Shark' popped up, and yep, sorry that's going to be stuck in your head all day now. Ludwig claimed that he played the catchy kids' tune for a brief couple of seconds, yet this was enough to have the stream taken down.</p>
<p>Ludiwg fans may remember how his announcement video made a direct reference to the fact that by joining YouTube, he would be able to use music on his streams. Well, turns out, it's not the case with 'Baby Shark'. Ludwig claimed: "I am pretty sure the corporate overlords that own Baby Shark have, like, an iron fist on YouTube, and so they took me down [...] apparently DMCA is going to be a little bit more of a concern than I had originally imagined." </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDPKQb86Qw0" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sDPKQb86Qw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>However, Ludwig didn't seem to take the ban completely to heart. In the video, Ludwig said: "It is kind of crazy that in the first four days on YouTube I got banned, in the first four years I never got banned but growing pains, we're getting through it." Ludwig further explained that through the experience he had learnt a "good note for the future." </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>When Will Ludwig Be Back On YouTube?</h2>
<p>Don't worry, Ludwig fans, as according to him, it will not be long until he is back up on YouTube. Ludwig claimed that things should be running as normal by December 4, when he'll be doing a 'Bro. vs Bro' against Thomas "<strong>TommyInnit</strong>" Simons and Matthew "<strong>Mizkif</strong>" Rinaudo will be joining Ludwig for a stream.</p>
<p>Ludwig clearly wasn't too fazed by the ban only three days after the switch. After all, he's not the only one, just look at <span> Zack "</span><strong>ZLaner</strong>" Lane being banned twice from<a href="/halo/" title="Halo"> <em>Halo Infinite</em></a> after <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/zlaner-has-been-banned-twice-after-just-one-day-on-halo-infinite/" target="_blank">just one day</a>. Although he did go on to claim that "kids music is the worst thing that ever happened to YouTube", Ludwig apologised to YouTube and said that it would never happen again. So, a lesson for us all there. If you're thinking of playing 'Baby Shark' during a live stream, doo doo doo doo doo don't. </p>

<p>Fans flooded the comments underneath the images, gushing over the similarities between the character and Gehe. One person wrote: "Hooooly, this is beyond amazing. The second picture got me goin' through a double take to make sure it wasn't a hyper realistic rendering of the original art. Thank you for the amazing cosplay!"</p>
<p>Another added: "Oh my god, the beautiful cosplay coupled with the stellar lighting really tricked my brain into thinking this was official Arcane art, hahah! This is beyond stunning!" </p>

<h2>What Is Arcane?</h2>
<p><em>Arcane</em> is a new show by Riot Games, hosted on Netflix. The show is based in the <em>League of Legends</em> universe, but I don't want to give away too many spoilers. </p>

<p>The show launched to critical acclaim, as well as fans of the game (and people who've never played it in their lives) enjoying the action. </p>
<p>In fact, it's been so successful that another season has already been commissioned by the streaming service. So expect to see a lot more cosplay going forward. </p>
<p>You can stream <em>Arcane</em> on Netflix now. </p>
