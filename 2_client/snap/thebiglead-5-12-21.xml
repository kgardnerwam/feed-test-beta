The <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/nfl/team/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> are at Metlife Stadium to face off against the New York Jets, but Jalen Hurts couldn&apos;t play after hurting his ankle against the <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/nfl/team/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a> last week. Philly traded a sixth-round pick for Minshew over the offseason, and he took over No. 2 duties back in October after Joe Flacco was traded. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_psd35qpn1">Minshew threw a touchdown pass on his first possession, so rust isn&apos;t an issue. The eclectic quarterback&apos;s outfit before the game may have helped with the confidence. As Scott Hanson noted, Minshew looks like he&apos;s straight out of <em>Top Gun </em>with his leather jacket and aviators. </p><figure data-mm-id="_prbshb49q" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">what a baller <a href="https://t.co/FjrY4bjU8u">pic.twitter.com/FjrY4bjU8u</a></p>&#x2014; alex (@highlghtheaven) <a href="https://twitter.com/highlghtheaven/status/1467558968373530632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_de1si0j2k">What a baller, indeed.

The Eagles have lost some momentum over the last two weeks and need a win to keep in the NFC wild card race. Minshew could very well be auditioning for a starting role somewhere else today. If he plays well, the Eagles could flip him next offseason for a pick, since they seem fully committed to Hurts. This is Minshew&apos;s shot. </p><aside class="style_4p6ay9" data-mm-id="_hze9931c9"></aside><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_rhaksfeea">We&apos;ll see if he takes advantage, but he got off to a great start with this fit. </p></main><aside class="sidebar_umon5d"></aside></div>]]></content:encoded>

Roethlisberger<a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/how-long-will-the-steelers-make-ben-roethlisberger-suffer-01fnm43q947v"> looks every bit the part of a 38-year-old signal-caller with an injury history</a>. He is below-average at this point in his career and actively hurts his team&apos;s chances of winning on his worst days. The time has come. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_tsve91hq1">Now the Steelers get to deal with the aftermath. They have no clear succession plan in place for Roethlisberger. The only investments they&apos;ve made into the QB position over the last few years were drafting Mason Rudolph and taking flier on Dwayne Haskins, who has been inactive for all of 2021. The draft is severely lacking in elite quarterback prospects this year. <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/ryan-clark-steelers-handling-of-ben-roethlisberger-situation-is-a-total-organizational-failure-01fgkza70fgx">There is no obvious path forward for this team. </a></p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_w03udhjvv">We&apos;ll give a shot at projecting what they&apos;ll do anyway. Here are the four options Pittsburgh has to replace Roethlisberger. </p><aside class="style_4p6ay9" data-mm-id="_b2717hr6s"></aside><h2 class="tagStyle_rlbnmf-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_ro5uws2yu">Aaron Rodgers </h2><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_squngebs9">Things are going pretty well in Green Bay this year (Rodgers&apos; vaccination status aside), so there&apos;s no guarantee the quarterback will hit the trade market next offseason. But after his dispute with the organization last offseason, anything can happen, and <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/aaron-rodgers-to-the-pittsburgh-steelers-makes-perfect-sense-01fh5pc0jsfc">Pittsburgh makes sense as a team to give up a king&apos;s ransom for Rodgers</a>. They don&apos;t really have assets other than their own draft picks and some good, young defensive talent, but they will probably be the most desperate team in any Rodgers sweepstakes. The defense is ready to win and Mike Tomlin isn&apos;t interested in presiding over rebuilding seasons. The Steelers as a franchise probably have too much pride for that. Rodgers would immediately launch them back into legitimate contender status, and the roster is strong enough that he would be interested in teaming up. If Rodgers wants out, the Steelers will be in the running. </p><h2 class="tagStyle_rlbnmf-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_9a9yvoz4q">Russell Wilson </h2><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_rvug7fevn">The other star QB who got into a bit of a spat with his team, Wilson may end up leaving Seattle if their season continues on its current track. For the same reasons mentioned above, Pittsburgh will aggressively pursue him if he hits the trade block. Wilson is arguably a better option than Rodgers due to the five-year age difference between the two. Rodgers is a better player but Wilson offers a longer tenure and more stability if things go well. But both are dream situations for Pittsburgh. </p><h2 class="tagStyle_rlbnmf-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_tdduviu9x">Mason Rudolph/Dwayne Haskins</h2><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_jzc2zq8zd">In what feels like the most likely situation, Pittsburgh can always bank on their internal development and trot out one of the two options they have currently sitting behind Roethilsberger next year. Haskins has more raw talent than Rudolph but was terrible when he started for Washington last year, throwing seven interceptions to match seven touchdowns while completing only 58 percent of his passes across seven games. He went 2-5 before getting benched and ending up in Pittsburgh. Rudolph has filled in for Roethlisberger a few times over the last two years but hasn&apos;t shown much; he started eight games in 2019 and completed 62 percent of his passes while throwing 13 touchdowns and nine picks, leading the Steelers to a 5-3 record in those games. Rudolph will probably get the nod unless Haskins has made massive strides behind the scenes. If the Steelers won&apos;t or can&apos;t make a big splash, these are their two options. </p><h2 class="tagStyle_rlbnmf-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_8owdng4cg">Take a Quarterback in the 2022 NFL Draft </h2><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_pogxj13nr">As mentioned above, this is not a strong draft class for signal-callers. Pittsburgh, however, does own all their high picks and look like they&apos;ll end up selecting in the late teens/early 20s range with potential to be higher if they completely fall off in the last  six games. Guys like Matt Corral out of Ole Miss or local prospect Kenny Pickett will definitely be there in the middle of the first round. But make no mistake: this class pales in comparison to the 2021 crop. The Steelers aren&apos;t finding their version of Mac Jones. But Tomlin is one of the NFL&apos;s best coaches, they have solid players at all the skill positions, and the defense was one of the league&apos;s best last year. Picking a project in the first round and hoping a strong supporting cast can cover for their flaws is not the worst idea, and is the least costly while bringing the chance of finding their next Big Ben. </p></main><aside class="sidebar_umon5d"></aside></div>]]></content:encoded>

All of those what-ifs. All of those blind r&#xE9;sum&#xE9;s and deep dives into strength of record and defensive efficiency. Those debates over which conference has a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> and which is nothing more than a box of cupcakes. Those times Gary Barta, the College Football Playoff selection committee&apos;s front-facing voice, went on television to say things that didn&apos;t make sense. The widespread consternation of a four-team model that inherently leaves one of the five power brokers on the outside looking in. And even those desperate attempts to explain how the BCS was actually a better system for determining a national champion. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_40ign9z18">It all amounts to nothing more than moot points and misdirected energy.

It will be Alabama, who finally looked like its old self against Georgia en route to the season&apos;s best win. It will be those Bulldogs from Athens, who previously earned the latitude to lose. It will be, against long odds, plucky and unblemished Cincinnati by virtue of a clean sheet and head-to-head win over the only other serious contender in Notre Dame. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_ialxikzvx">There you have it. One can quibble with the order here. Michigan has every bit the argument to No. 1 as Alabama but history has shown its tough to penetrate the SEC shield. Luke Fickell has known from Day 1 that if his team were to get in, it would never get a better seed than the last one available. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_p5tahktqt">I&apos;m not saying I told you so. It would be excruciatingly bad television or podcasting to repeat &quot;we&apos;ll see what happens&quot; and &quot;time will tell&quot; in regards to college football&apos;s title chase. A co-host probably wouldn&apos;t appreciate that approach if there were many hours to fill. So there&apos;s no probably in playing the game week to week. </p><figure data-mm-id="_841v3vh8f" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">David Pollack, on everyone on this ESPN2 panel having the same CFP top four: &#x201C;We need to find something to talk about for the next three hours.&#x201D;</p>&#x2014; Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisVannini/status/1467506107568508929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><aside class="style_4p6ay9" data-mm-id="_a9k9ohosx"></aside><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_kj4p87g3n">Attention. ESPN needs it and the sport needs it. Any conversation with college football&apos;s on-field product in the spotlight is beneficial to the bottom line.

The man boldly embraces the unseasoned <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/laura-rutledge-nfl-live-espn-01eqx8pgn9s2">even in the face of regular pushback from his colleagues,</a> which is both bland but also a little admirable. Something about a person sticking to their principles even if those principles cause his salt and pepper shakers to feel ostracized from the broader spice community. </p><figure data-mm-id="_bng6kpn7b" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/gKdLu6KHVH">pic.twitter.com/gKdLu6KHVH</a></p>&#x2014; Dan Orlovsky (@danorlovsky7) <a href="https://twitter.com/danorlovsky7/status/1308807642991726592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote></figure><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_4hniot0gj">If such an alert system where in place Friday night, interested parties all over the world would have been pinged to inform that the pundit had made pizza. Pizza so life-changing it inspired one of those fleeting thoughts we all get from time to time. Thoughts of walking away from it all and starting a food truck .</p><figure data-mm-id="_bsa77lqfm" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">May quit football and start a pizza truck <a href="https://t.co/FjipVLonm4">pic.twitter.com/FjipVLonm4</a></p>&#x2014; Dan Orlovsky (@danorlovsky7) <a href="https://twitter.com/danorlovsky7/status/1466920712678084611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_064q0szbf">Look, there is no such thing as bad pizza. Nature&apos;s perfect food remains such even though human error and imperfection in the preparation department. Food Twitter is perhaps the most judgemental of all the online community and the lackluster presentation exacerbated the predictably negative reaction here. </p><aside class="style_4p6ay9" data-mm-id="_4tgf16mu3"></aside><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_77tyvpikj">But I don&apos;t know. If the intention was to get me interested in trying the pizza, Orlovsky definitely succeeded. More than that, it would be tremendous content if he did shock the sports media world and trade his studio gig in for a wood-fire oven and sliced pepperoni. The <em>Chef</em> movie with Jon Favreau is a lot different if the protagonist can quickly diagnose a Cover-3 while sprinkling mozzarella. Not better, just different. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_o9v0h04xa">Considering how valued the former quarterback is internally at ESPN there&apos;s very little chance he walks away from a promising career to cook up pie. It will probably remain a mere hobby, and that&apos;s okay. Homemade pizza is a wonderful thing, varying from house to house. Orlovsky&apos;s may not be your slice of choice but evil flounders when good people sit by and say nothing. And to that end I will always stand up for those who are doing the work of making something from scratch and harboring big, crusty dreams. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_0zjs2zks5">Cook on, Dan. </p></main><aside class="sidebar_umon5d"></aside></div>]]></content:encoded>

You&apos;re not going to get any calls. Officials, they tend to not stop the game to change calls. You have to understand there&apos;s a point in time in games -- dead balls -- to be able to talk to officials.
<br>
<br>&quot;While the game is going on, transition defense is one of the things we&apos;ve talked about that we have to get better. If we&apos;re lobbying for calls during live play, it puts us in harm&apos;s way. ... Just some things have got to be a little bit more important. I think we&apos;re going to get better at understanding as a team when to talk to officials.

On Friday night he even seemed to agree with his coach by saying, &quot;J. Kidd, he&apos;s got a point. I&apos;ve got to stop doing that.&quot;</p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_l09txh1bw">Doncic was in discussions with officials for most of Friday night&apos;s game.

While the school&apos;s search for a new athletic director drags on for another week, it&apos;s clear the athletic department is an absolute mess. Despite that, The U is preparing to make a run at Miami alum, and current Oregon head coach, Mario Cristobal.</p><figure data-mm-id="_51snjujbd" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Despite fact Miami doesn&#x2019;t have a permanent AD, the Hurricanes will &quot;make a run at (Oregon coach) Mario Cristobal in coming days,&#x201D; <a href="https://twitter.com/flasportsbuzz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@flasportsbuzz</a> reports</p>&#x2014; Brett McMurphy (@Brett_McMurphy) <a href="https://twitter.com/Brett_McMurphy/status/1466841292286140424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><figure data-mm-id="_56l91g9cj" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just updated this column with new information.

Cristobal led the Ducks to a Rose Bowl win in 2019 and a Fiesta Bowl loss last season. Since taking over as the full-time head coach in December of 2017 he&apos;s gone 35-12, with a 23-9 record in the Pac-12. He struggled at his previous stop during six seasons as the head coach at FIU where he went 27-47, but he&apos;s certainly been better at Oregon. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_w76b8i59o">The 51-year-old Cristobal isn&apos;t the best in-game coach and often makes some pretty confusing decisions, but he&apos;s a dynamite recruiter and his team has often overcome some of his shortcomings. </p><aside class="style_4p6ay9" data-mm-id="_rwyn6ayp2"></aside><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_duid630cn">Miami badly needs someone who can recruit the area and Cristobal fits that bill. For years SEC teams and other prominent programs have poached the best talent in Florida away from Miami and Florida State. In the 2022 recruiting class, <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://247sports.com/Season/2022-Football/CompositeRecruitRankings/?InstitutionGroup=HighSchool&amp;State=FL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">none of the state&apos;s top 25 players</a> is expected to commit to Miami. That&apos;s criminal.</p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_409jlidnk">The question of course isn&apos;t really what Cristobal would bring to Miami, but what Miami can offer Cristobal to get him to move. What he&apos;s a Miami native and an alum, would leading the Hurricanes actually be a better job? Oregon is winning now and while USC just made a huge move to land Lincoln Riley, the Ducks still sit atop the Pac-12 for now. Miami needs a massive rebuild that would star with meticulously reestablishing recruiting pipelines all over the state, while going head-to-head with the Clemsons, Georgias and Alabamas of the world. It would be a massive undertaking. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_in1d2jsz0">On top of all that, Miami&apos;s athletic department looks like a complete mess right now. The school doesn&apos;t even have a full-time athletic director. Would Cristobal sign on not knowing who he&apos;ll be working for? That&apos;s highly doubtful. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_ov4ennr7k">If Oregon ponies up for one of those new and increasingly-popular $100 million contracts, could Miami put the money together to beat it? The pull of an alma mater can be great, but cash is also a huge motivator. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_j7w1awcgo">We&apos;ll see what happens. Cristobal has a pretty good where he is, but the chance to return home to his university and rebuilding the glory years could be too much to pass up. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_vhjrpzlye"><em><strong>UPDATE:</strong></em><em> It appears Miami is reportedly set to hire Clemson athletic director Dan Radakovich, which would certainly help in their pursuit of a head coach:</em></p><figure data-mm-id="_wt4w8y22b" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am told by a source that Clemson AD Dan Radakovich is going to Miami. <br><br>Next move will be decision on football coach.</p>&#x2014; John Canzano (@johncanzanobft) <a href="https://twitter.com/johncanzanobft/status/1466895800223473664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote></figure></main><aside class="sidebar_umon5d"></aside></div>]]></content:encoded>

Notre Dame will play in a New Year&apos;s Six bowl game in just a few short weeks, so somebody had to step up. The school could have named an interim coach while they <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/candidates-notre-dame-brian-kelly-luke-fickell-matt-campbell-freeman-urban-meyer-fitzgerald-01fnq8zx94x1">conducted a bigger search</a>, but they chose promote defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman from within instead.

Here&apos;s the moment where Freeman, who is only in his first season at Notre Dame, was introduced to the team as their new coach.</p><figure data-mm-id="_mfoj47dsn" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">a player&apos;s coach<a href="https://twitter.com/Marcus_Freeman1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Marcus_Freeman1</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoIrish?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GoIrish</a> <a href="https://t.co/pf9E1OygA8">pic.twitter.com/pf9E1OygA8</a></p>&#x2014; Notre Dame Football (@NDFootball) <a href="https://twitter.com/NDFootball/status/1466773192563904519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_v68psf8n7">If that reaction is any indication, they approve. For Freeman, who only turns 36 next month, what a moment it must have been. It was one of those scenes that somebody gets to experience just once in their entire life. Freeman was named head coach of a major football program.

This smashed the existing NBA record for lopsidedness, besting the previous mark (68 points) set by the 1991 <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/nba/team/miami-heat">Miami Heat</a>. Seventy-three points is more than enough to cover any legal spread but the final tally could have actually been more stunning. A late Thunder flurry helped reduce the deficit from 78 down to a more respectable 73. And those cosmetic scores didn&apos;t come easy as an insatiable and manic home crowd demanded maximum effort on the defensive end even with history clinched.</p><figure data-mm-id="_zmfh57rzx" class="style_hixsc7-o_O-style_48hmcm"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">listen to this DE-FENSE chant from the Memphis crowd up 78 <a href="https://t.co/Ls3KJY8AKK">pic.twitter.com/Ls3KJY8AKK</a></p>&#x2014; Rob Perez (@WorldWideWob) <a href="https://twitter.com/WorldWideWob/status/1466621667728257030?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_hin9hvqp0">Very strong performance by the fans.

Forty percent of the Grizzlies&apos; starters combined for 11 points while everyone else contributed 141. The Thunder made as many free throws as Memphis attempted.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wrapper_wfxu5h"><main><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_l32w5ngmw">The bad news for <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/nfl/player/sean-payton">Sean Payton</a> is that his bet to go all-in on Taysom Hill as a full-time quarterback has failed to bear much fruit, leaving the once-promising New Orleans Saints on the wrong side of the NFC&apos;s playoff picture. Playing with a significantly injured finger on his throwing hand, the 31-year-old Swiss Army knife inflicted more pain on his team than the <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/nfl/team/dallas-cowboys">Dallas Cowboys</a> last night, throwing four interceptions in a spirit-dashing loss to an undermanned opponent. Hill completed fewer than half his 41 passes and posted a cringeworthy 44.2 passer rating in his extended time of the position. There&apos;s bad and then there&apos;s begging for Trevor Siemian bad. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_fjxx39biu">This was the latter.</p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_xhjylycyu">Pitchforks and torches will be out in full force across the reactionary landscape this morning but those haters simply aren&apos;t taking the long view. They aren&apos;t being fair. Hill clearly needs more seasoning. We&apos;re thinking, at this pace, he should be a viable NFL quarterback no later than his age 38 season. That&apos;s a seven-year ramp for him to learn what it takes and get some of those youthful indiscretions out of his system. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_f0a74orzo">People need to remember that Hill was but a wide-eyed 28-year-old when he threw his first professional pass. Can you even imagine how hard it is to acclimate to the real world while acclimating to the NFL? Whatever happened to patience? Look long and hard for a quarterback who threw 13 times before turning 30. It&apos;s not easy to find. Usually players need to sit and wait their turn before being thrust into action like that. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_cnu733yxg">Hill showed he could be the next big thing last year by completing 72 percent of his throws while relying on his legs. A 3-1 record suggested he could Tim Tebow his way into the playoffs and hope for a random championship run. That&apos;s why Payton and the front office felt confident moving on from Jameis Winston in the wake of Drew Brees&apos; retirement. That&apos;s why the triple threat was offered a confusing yet ultimately rich new four-year contract. (<a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/taysom-hill-contract-saints-quarterback-guarantees-01fn4ymy3k19">Again</a>.) When that&apos;s over, Hill will only be 35 and, hopefully a few short seasons from his prime. </p><aside class="style_4p6ay9" data-mm-id="_mup6tiexe"></aside><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_r6vc8ci4s">Laugh if you must. Evidence that NFL signal-callers are playing longer and retaining productivity is obvious. Tom Brady is 44 and could win the MVP. Aaron Rodgers is 37 and has the energy of someone who took a bunch of <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/aaron-rodgers-joe-rogan-vaccine-01fkrgymft59">pills hawked by Joe Rogan</a>. Even the aforementioned Brees sprouted a <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://www.thebiglead.com/posts/drew-brees-new-hair-transplant-nbc-01ff6h2yj6fk">nice new head of hair</a>, proving age is but a number. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_inzz3sm56">There&apos;s something wrong with an instant-gratification society that demands a quarterback learn how to play the position before they are personally ready. Not everyone is on the same timeline. Matthew Stafford may have been comfortable at 21 and Kyler Murray at 22. Hill may not get there until he&apos;s legally eligible to become president. This is not a one-size-fits-all world.</p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_l6fqfvplh">To this point, Payton seems willing to see this thing out, no matter how long it takes. And when Hill does look adequate for a full month in 2025, well, the joke will be on everyone else. </p></main><aside class="sidebar_umon5d"></aside></div>]]></content:encoded>

Andrew Marchand of the New York Post reports Brandon Tierney and Tiki Barber will replace Maggie Gray and Marc Malusis in the 10-2 timeslot. <a class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_16tsvnu" href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/02/tiki-barber-in-middle-of-massive-wfan-shakeup/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Per Marchand</a>: </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_lw4r3bst9"><em>Tiki Barber and longtime New York talk show host Brandon Tierney will replace Maggie Gray and Marc Malusis as WFAN&#x2019;s new midday team beginning after the New Year, The Post has learned.</em></p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_5f29dkkaf"><em>The last eight years, Tierney and Barber have hosted together on CBS Sports Radio Network.

The presence of Barber, an all-time great New York Giant, certainly will not hurt. </p><p class="tagStyle_936wcx-o_O-style_1tcxgp3-o_O-style_48hmcm-o_O-style_1ngkwsz" data-mm-id="_cdixoux0c">A pretty great get for WFAN.
