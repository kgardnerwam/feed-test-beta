Plenty of aggression and completed  a ridiculous nine tackles overall. Cleared one off the line too.<br/><br/><strong>Ezri Konsa (CB) - 8/10 - </strong>Nicked a goal off Buendia in the first half but there was no doubt over his second - a towering header. <br/><br/><strong>Tyrone Mings (CB) - 5/10 - </strong>Positioning was okay, but his passing left a lot to be desired. <br/><br/><strong>Ashley Young (LB) - 6/10 - </strong>Not given much to do by Lookman, nor by any of his replacements. </p><h2>2.

Struggled to prevent Leicester getting on the break in the first half but improved significantly in the second period.<strong><br/><br/>Douglas Luiz (CM) - 7/10 - </strong>Broke the lines with a string of progressive passes.

The defender was withdrawn midway through the first half and replaced by Ryan Sessegnon, who gave a more positive account of himself after his red card in the Europa Conference League defeat to Mura in his last game.</p><p>Conte added: “Reguilon is a generous player, because he started the game, and he wasn’t 100 per cent. I spoke with him at the end of the game, and we stopped him at the right time. I hope to have him very soon. It’s not an injury, only fatigue in his muscle.</p><p>“On one hand, I was disappointed with this situation. On the other, I think Ryan Sessegnon had the possibility to play. This player is very young, he needs to feel confidence and to feel also the right atmosphere, that’s he’s playing for an important shirt. </p><p>&#34;He has the capacity, the quality, but he has to work. I’m pleased for him, and for Doherty, when he came in, he played very well. We need all the players in the squad.

Perceptions rely predominantly on outcomes and so, when part of a team underperforming expectations, players can quickly become scapegoats.</p><p>The good thing about football&#39;s inherent fickleness, however, is that narratives can swing quickly. The phrase from hero to villain - and vice versa - doesn&#39;t quite boast the relationship with any other part of society than it does with football.</p><p>Enter Fred. So often a regular whipping boy under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, by the end of Ralf Rangnick&#39;s Old Trafford bow the Brazilian was the protagonist of the piece.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_887,h_591,x_61,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01fp5qs0v20fcn9vs58d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="GettyImages" data-licensor-name="GettyImages" data-portal-copyright="Alex Livesey/GettyImages"><figcaption>Fred celebrates his winning goal | Alex Livesey/GettyImages</figcaption></figure><p>Rangnick lined <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">Man Utd</a> up a 4-2-2-2 formation, instructing Jadon Sancho and Bruno Fernandes to play centrally behind a front two of Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo. Fred and his midfield partner Scott McTominay sat at the base of the midfield.</p><p>The intensity of United&#39;s press in the opening exchanges was relentless. It was, in short, everything the Old Trafford faithful had expected from Rangnick. The distances were right, the energy was sufficient and, were it not for some heroic Crystal Palace defending, it would have yielded a goal inside the opening half hour.</p><p>Central to that was the creativity of Fernandes and the slaloming dribbles of Sancho in attacking areas, but Fred&#39;s role cannot be overlooked. The Brazilian was denied a surefire opener in the first half when Tomkins diverted his goal-bound strike from the edge of the area away for a corner. </p><p>The opportunity offered a glimpse into the knock-on effect for Fred in Rangnick&#39;s system. With a clear emphasis on central occupation - hence the lack of width in the midfield line - Fred is given the license to supplement attacks without fear that he will vacate large swathes of space in the centre of the pitch.</p><p>It was no surprise, then, that his goal came from an identical move. Again, he was on hand to support Mason Greenwood on the edge of the penalty area when the Englishman&#39;s path became crowded by Palace defenders. The quality of his finish - with his weaker foot no less - left Rangnick purring on the touchline.</p><p>Many will point to the Brazilian&#39;s display in Man Utd&#39;s midweek win over <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/arsenal">Arsenal</a> as evidence that his revival preceded Rangnick&#39;s arrival. United improved structurally under Michael Carrick and, as a result, Fred was able to make a positive impact.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_956,h_637,x_36,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01fp5qt7xz5jsf0zqn51.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="GettyImages" data-licensor-name="GettyImages" data-portal-copyright="Alex Livesey/GettyImages"><figcaption>Rangnick celebrates | Alex Livesey/GettyImages</figcaption></figure><p>However, his performance raised the mouthwatering prospect of Fred under Rangnick. The German spoke about bringing &#34;control&#34; to Man Utd and there&#39;s few players in the current squad who will benefit more from serenity around him than Fred in the heart of midfield.</p><p>There will inevitably be winners and losers in the transition between Solskjaer and Rangnick. Players who benefitted from the chaos of the Norwegian&#39;s style of football may find themselves left behind as the German instills a bit of order into United&#39;s performances.</p><p>Already after just 90 minutes of football, however, Fred is inching towards the winners column. Scorer of the first goal of the Rangnick era, he could be set to become a crucial piece of the furniture. </p>]]></content:encoded><category>man utd</category></item><item><title>The best teams to start a save with in Football Manager 2022</title><link>https://www.90min.com/posts/best-teams-to-start-a-save-with-football-manager-2022?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Tom Gott</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fnbpt5fhf2</guid><description>30 teams you should start a save with in Football Manager 2022.</description><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 17:45:24 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5000,h_2812,x_0,y_459/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/GettyImages/mmsport/90min_en_international_web/01fnbw4ckt7cq8t40jnt.jpg" caption="Atalanta are on the cusp of greatness | Eurasia Sport Images/GettyImages"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Tom Gott"></flatplan:author><keywords>SEO,Opinion - List,Football Manager</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Figuring out which team to take control of is the toughest decision you&#39;ll make at the start of Football Manager 2022 as there are so many brilliant options out there.</p><p>Taking charge of one of the game&#39;s top sides is always an option, but delve a little deeper and you&#39;ll find so many fascinating and fanciful stories waiting to be bought to life.</p><p>With you at the helm, dreams may become a reality, and you&#39;re bound to have plenty of fun along the way.

You didn&#39;t know what to expect from the Lilywhites at the start, because they didn&#39;t have a designated style of play. Eventually, as cracks began to widen, performances became drearier and drearier, the writing firmly on the wall.</p><p>On Sunday, in Antonio Conte&#39;s latest match in charge, Spurs showed they are understanding what their manager wants more clearly.</p><p>The ball was frequently shifted out wide, most prominently to Ryan Sessegnon - who replaced the injured Sergio Reguilon - while Son and Lucas Moura picked up the pockets of space infield that were vacant.</p><p>It was the lovely interplay with <a href="https://www.90min.com/players/son-heung-min">Son</a> that allowed Lucas to unleash a rocket of a shot into the top corner, though Spurs hardly blew the visitors away. In fact, they were behind on possession by both half time and full time, and gave up a number of presentable chances to the Canaries.</p><p>Against teams with more quality up front - more than Teemu Pukki, Adam Idah and Josh Sargent, anyway - <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">Spurs</a> would have been dragged back to parity. Davinson Sanchez looked uncomfortable trying to bring the ball out from the back, while Hugo Lloris also nearly gifted Norwich an equaliser just moments after his side went ahead.</p><p>While Spurs can be functional for now under Conte, a lack of quality in certain areas will have to be addressed at some point if they want to become a top side again.</p><p>In more positive news, the system Conte has put in place is getting better performances out of previously maligned squad members.</p><figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Player ratings from Tottenham Hotspur Stadium for <a href="https://twitter.com/90min_Football?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@90min_Football</a> - thought Skipp, Davies and Dier were all excellent <a href="https://t.co/GlZS9JUqdI">https://t.co/GlZS9JUqdI</a></p>— Jude Summerfield (@judesummerfield) <a href="https://twitter.com/judesummerfield/status/1467526866156326917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><p>Ben Davies - also known as &#39;Gentle Ben&#39; - brought the ball forward with purpose from his centre back position and had a hand in both of Tottenham&#39;s second half goals.

Horrible bit of goalkeeping almost gave the Finland international an instant equaliser. Was spritely off his line on a few occasions to mop up possession.<br/><br/><strong>Davinson Sanchez (CB) - 7/10 -</strong> Looked a bit like Bambi on ice trying to bring the ball out from defence. A fair few iffy moments but was in the right place at the right time to lash in Tottenham&#39;s second. Grew into the game and looked more confident by full time.<br/><br/><strong>Eric Dier (CB) - 8/10 - </strong><a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/tottenham">Tottenham&#39;</a>s best defender. Sniffed out danger early on and proactively dealt with <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/norwich">Norwich</a>&#39;s threats.<br/><br/><strong>Ben Davies (CB) - 8/10 -</strong> Couldn&#39;t adjust his feet quick enough to divert a Son free kick into the goal. Disrupted the Canaries&#39; defence for Sanchez&#39;s goal. Got forward well - his assist for Son&#39;s strike was particularly composed - and carried out his defensive duties diligently.</p><h2>2. Midfielders & wing backs</h2><p><strong>Japhet Tanganga (RWB) - 5/10 -</strong> Came in for Emerson Royal, who was missing through illness. Had a interesting battle with Williams, not always getting the better of the <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> loanee.<br/><br/><strong>Oliver Skipp (CM) - 8/10 - </strong>Great run through the middle of the pitch, but his shot was straight at Krul. Some excellent ball recoveries roused the crowd throughout. Another top display.<br/><br/><strong>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (CM) - 7/10 -</strong> Found some decent spots to receive possession, keeping the ball and moving it on nicely.<br/><br/><strong>Sergio Reguilon (LWB) - 5/10 -</strong> Had some positional problems early on and got booked. Soon clutched his hamstring and had to be replaced by Sessegnon.</p><h2>3.

Brought a good save out of Krul from the edge of the box. The ball just wouldn&#39;t sit for him to break his league drought.<br/><br/><strong>Son Heung-min (LW) - 8/10 - </strong>Claimed the assist for Lucas&#39; strike. Got a few shots away and his corner also led to Sanchez&#39;s goal. Kept his head to seal the points with a good low finish.</p><h2>4. Substitutes</h2><p><strong>Ryan Sessegnon (LWB) - 6/10 - </strong>Came on for the injured Reguilon. Got his head down and looked to attack Aarons out wide, often getting into promising positions. Will be interesting to see how he fares if Reguilon&#39;s injury keeps him sidelined.<br/><br/><strong>Matt Doherty (RWB) - 6/10 -</strong> On just after the hour mark for Tanganga. Did well in the lead-up to Tottenham&#39;s second, picking out Kane before the corner was won. Lashed a decent opening just over the bar.<br/><br/><strong>Steven Bergwijn (RW) - 5/10 - </strong>Brought on for the last ten minutes.</p><hr /><h2>NORWICH PLAYER RATINGS</h2><h2>5.

Leeds captain Liam Cooper hobbled off after a quarter of an hour, forcing a reshuffle that saw Marcelo Bielsa introduce the winger Jack Harrison for his centre back.</p><p>The enforced replacement rippled through <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/leeds">Leeds</a>&#39; side as they struggled to engage <a href="https://www.90min.com/teams/brentford">Brentford</a> as high up the pitch as they are famed for. The Bees endured issues in the same zone themselves. Robbed of the direct option the absent Ivan Toney offers, Brentford had to play their way through the Leeds pressure.</p><p>After recovering rapidly to quash a number of turnovers on halfway, Brentford paid the price for another giveaway 27 minutes in. Tyler Roberts began the move with an interception in midfield, scuttling into the box while Raphinha had his first cross blocked. At the second attempt the talismanic Brazilian picked out Roberts sliding into the six yard to break the deadlock. </p><p>A stunning save from Brentford&#39;s Alvaro Fernandez prevented Leeds doubling their lead on 50 minutes, as he clawed Luke Ayling’s header out of the top corner from Raphinha’s set piece. </p><p>Within five minutes Brentford had struck back themselves. Rico Henry muscled Stuart Dallas off the ball by Leeds’ right hand corner flag, and found Sergi Canos inside the penalty area. Brentford’s regular wing-back - drafted into the frontline in Toney’s absence - had his cross deflect kindly into the path of Shandon Baptiste to fire Brentford level.</p><p>Buoyed by their equaliser, the entire Brentford team seemingly shifted up the pitch. Taking their turn to pen Leeds into their defensive third, Brentford exploited another vertebrae robbed from the hosts&#39; spine when Kalvin Phillips was forcibly removed in the wake of Baptiste&#39;s leveller. </p><p>Moments after nodding over from close range, Canos made no mistake with a crisp finish inside the box to cap off a slick interchange from the Bees following a high turnover.</p><p>Yet, just as the game threatened to squirm out of Leeds&#39; grasp, Bamford sent a dagger into the heart of Brentford with a last gasp equaliser, stabbing a 95th-minute corner in at the back post to cap off his first appearance since mid-September in style.</p><p>Here are your player ratings for both teams...</p><hr /><h2><em>Leeds player ratings</em></h2><h2>1.
