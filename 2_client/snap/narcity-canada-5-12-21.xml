U.S.
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congressman-posts-family-christmas-picture-with-guns-days-after-school-2021-12-05/" target="_blank">Congressman Thomas Massie</a> is facing criticism after posting a &quot;Christmas&quot; photo of himself and his family posing with guns &#x2014; just days after multiple teenagers were killed in a school shooting in Michigan.
</p><p>
On Saturday, December 4, Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky
<a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1467197523127422979" target="_blank">shared the image via Twitter</a> and added the caption, &quot;Merry Christmas! ps. Santa, please bring ammo.&quot;
</p><p>
The picture shows Massie alongside what appears to be his wife and children, all smiling at the camera while holding an assortment of guns.
</p><p>
By Sunday, the post had received a considerable amount of backlash, with Twitter users from all over the world calling out the timing of the social media post.

&quot;Mr. Massie, have you no shame?&quot;
<a href="https://twitter.com/DMC66MN/status/1467327790198538243" target="_blank">asked one person</a>, including photos of the four victims of Tuesday&apos;s shooting at an Oxford, Michigan high school.
</p><p>
&quot;Here&#x2019;s a photo. It&#x2019;s my home town in mourning. I live in Oxford Michigan,&quot;
<a href="https://twitter.com/pecriel/status/1467274982283784195" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">another added</a>.
</p><p>
On November 30, 2021, a 15-year-old student allegedly carried out
<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/parents-michigan-teen-accused-school-shooting-could-face-own-charges-2021-12-03/" target="_blank">the deadliest U.S. school shooting of 2021</a>. Four teenage students were killed and seven others, <a href="https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/local/2021/12/01/what-we-know-about-the-victims-of-the-oxford-high-school-shooting/" target="_blank">including a teacher</a>, were hurt. The suspect and his parents have been arrested in connection with the shooting.<br>
</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>
A number of survivors of shootings, as well as families of victims, responded to the congressman&#x2019;s post, with some sharing photos of the loved ones they have lost.
</p><p>
&quot;Since we are sharing family photos, here are mine,&quot;
<a href="https://twitter.com/fred_guttenberg/status/1467222605388296202" target="_blank">wrote one person</a>. &quot;One is the last photo that I ever took of Jaime, the other is where she is buried because of the Parkland school shooting.&quot;

Another person <a href="https://twitter.com/BrucePetillo/status/1467309113977622529" target="_blank">said</a>, &quot;This is my son Christian, who was killed by a gun on 9/5/21. Perhaps you can reflect on the meaning of the Christmas season and find empathy in your heart for families like mine that will have an empty place in our Christmas photo due to senseless gun violence.&quot;

Criticizing the American politician, somebody else wrote, &quot;The bar was on the floor, but somehow you managed to tunnel underneath it.&quot;

<a href="https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1467222203473215504" target="_blank">Massie responded</a> to this message to say, &quot;The BAR is under the couch,&quot; and added the hashtag &quot;#sassywithmassie.&quot;

He started off with the 2009 rom-com <em>The Proposal </em>that she and Reynolds starred in, and a particular scene came to her mind almost immediately.</p><p>&quot;Ryan and I have known each other since we were prepubescent. I mean, we go way, way, way, way back,&quot; Bullock shared with Ray.</p><p>When it came time to film the comedic naked scene with Reynolds, she said it was just a few crew members and director Anne Fletcher around.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</p><p>&quot;So we had a closed set, which means no one&apos;s allowed to be on there, just hair and makeup coming to fluff and hide. Ryan and I have these flesh-coloured things stuck to our privates,&quot; she explained.</p><p>&quot;My hair is strategically over the nipples and Ryan&apos;s little &#x2014; not little at all &#x2014; it&apos;s just whatever&apos;s there, and I don&#x2019;t know, &apos;cause I didn&apos;t see it, I didn&#x2019;t look,&quot; she shared, adding that his bits got tucked away wherever they needed to go, but apparently not well enough.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>After filming a take, the scene cut and Bullock said that Fletcher shouted, &quot;Ryan! We can see your ballsack!&quot;</p><p>&quot;And I&#x2019;m like, &apos;Oh god!&apos; &apos;Cause you want to look down,&quot; Bullock said. &quot;Like, &apos;Don&#x2019;t look down, don&#x2019;t look down.&apos;&quot; </p><p>Although she seemed a little flustered about the whole thing, apparently Reynolds was totally &quot;cool&quot; about it. &quot;Unflappable. He&#x2019;s absolutely unflappable,&quot; she said.</p><p>Reynolds recently wrapped up the press tour for the <a href="https://www.narcity.com/ryan-reynolds-says-red-notice-broke-records--he-gave-a-cheeky-shoutout-to-taylor-swift" target="_blank">wildly successful Netflix hit </a><em><a href="https://www.narcity.com/ryan-reynolds-says-red-notice-broke-records--he-gave-a-cheeky-shoutout-to-taylor-swift">Red Notice</a>,</em> where he got up to all kinds of hijinks with his co-stars. <a href="https://www.narcity.com/dwayne-johnson-hired-a-billboard-to-embarrass-ryan-reynolds-he-had-the-best-response" target="_blank">Dwayne Johnson hired a billboard</a> to poke fun at the Canadian actor, which was really only fair after Reynolds said that the back of <a href="https://www.narcity.com/ryan-reynolds-said-the-back-of-dwayne-johnsons-head-looks-like-a-penis-and-we-cant-unsee-it" target="_blank">Johnson&apos;s head looks like a &quot;beautiful penis&quot;</a> that is &quot;hard as a rock.&quot;</p><p>This may be the last of Reynolds we see for a while as he recently announced that he&apos;s <a href="https://www.narcity.com/ryan-reynolds-just-opened-up-about-why-hes-taking-a-sabbatical-from-movies" target="_blank">taking a sabbatical</a> from movie making to spend time with his girls.

</div><p>A cozy Christmas tent has been constructed for a second year, and it comes with toasty heaters to keep you warm as you dine. Inside, you can step into a kitschy &apos;80s paradise with pops of pink and old-time holiday films playing on a projector upstairs. </p><p>There are also festive dishes to enjoy, including gingerbread pancakes, <a href="https://www.narcity.com/toronto/this-toronto-food-market-is-like-snacking-in-santas-kitchen-heres-a-first-look-photos" target="_blank">holiday cocktails</a>, and candy cane milkshakes. </p><p>On December 18, Santa will be stopping by for a special brunch event, and he&apos;ll be handing out candy to guests. Reservations for the brunch and holiday tent can be made online, so put on your ugliest sweater and step back in time this season.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Procrastinating drivers, beware! The provincial government announced on Wednesday that it&apos;s officially bringing back its renewal requirements for <a href="https://www.narcity.com/toronto/expired-ontario-licence-plate-stickers-were-ticketed-by-police-but-ford-says-its-okay" target="_blank">expired Ontario licence plate stickers</a>, driver&apos;s licences, and health cards. </p><p>The government had previously extended the validity of the documents back in March 2020 to reduce the number of people visiting ServiceOntario centres and help prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>Now, residents will have to get their driver&apos;s licences, cards and plate stickers renewed by February 28, 2022.</p><p>On top of this, &quot;novice licence holders,&quot; including those who currently have their G1 or G2, will have until December 31, 2022, to upgrade their licence.*</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s critical that drivers and vehicle owners have up-to-date documents for work, access to services and travel, and to keep our roads safe. I strongly encourage those who have deferred their renewals &#x2013; approximately 17 per cent of Ontarians &#x2013; to plan ahead and renew their documents online,&quot; Caroline Mulroney, minister of transportation, <a href="https://news.ontario.ca/en/release/1000778/ontario-reinstating-renewal-requirements-for-drivers-licences-licence-plate-stickers-and-health-cards" target="_blank">said in a press release</a>.</p><p>Anyone looking to renew their provincial documents in the near future is encouraged to use ServiceOntario&apos;s online option. The government has announced that it has temporarily waived the need for residents to renew their licences in person. </p><p><em>*This article has been updated.</em></p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>
