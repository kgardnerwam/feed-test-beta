<p>Earlier this year, <a href="/robert-carlyle">Robert Carlyle</a> revealed that a TV series adaptation of <a href="/irvine-welsh">Irvine Welsh</a>’s 2016 novel <em>The Blade Artist</em> <a href="/film-tv/article/54353/1/trainspotting-tv-series-spin-off-reportedly-in-works-irvine-welsh-robert-carlyle">is in the works</a>, continuing the story of his psychopathic <a href="/trainspotting"><em>Trainspotting</em></a> character, Begbie (who returned in the film’s long-awaited follow-up, <a href="/fashion/article/36130/1/trainspotting-t2-costume-designer-rachael-fleming-interview-fashion-90s"><em>T2: Trainspotting</em></a>, in 2017).</p>
<p>Now, Carlyle has shared more details on the upcoming project, which was previously said to include the author himself (though director Danny Boyle has <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/trainspotting-third-film-spinoff-begbie-danny-boyle-says-986618/">distanced himself</a> in the past). In a December 5 interview with <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/trainspotting-at-25-robert-carlyle-reveals-details-of-new-series-following-begbie-as-definitive-book-marks-films-25th-anniversary-12485039"><em>Sky News</em></a>, the actor says that the spin-off series is still “a way off at the moment”, estimating that it could arrive “18 months or so maybe down the line”.</p>
<p>However, he does describe what we can expect from the plot, which picks up the narrative in the wake of Welsh’s previous novels, <em>Trainspotting </em>and <em>Porno</em>. “It’s based on Irvine Welsh’s novel,<em> The Blade Artist</em>,” says Carlyle, “which kind of takes on Begbie’s story well after the whole <em>Trainspotting</em> events have passed by.”</p>
<p>“He has discovered art while he’s in prison, his form of art is sculpture. And he ends up marrying his art therapist from the prison, which I guess, you know, that’s a kind of well-worn path that happens a lot. I’ve investigated and studied that, that happens.”</p><p>Following prison, Begbie has ended up in California, Carlyle adds. “He’s in California with a wife, children. His artwork has been taken by the kind of glitterati of the day. He’s a kind of cause celebre suddenly.”</p>
<p>While that scene might sound more glamorous than the gritty Edinburgh of <em>Trainspotting</em>, Begbie is quickly dragged back into his violent former life: “Very quickly, within 10 pages of the book, he gets a phone call from back home and his son has been murdered by a gang. So he has to go back, and as he goes back, it just spirals out of control.”</p>
<p>As well as the upcoming adaptation of <em>The Blade Artist</em>, Irvine Welsh <a href="/film-tv/article/54803/1/irvine-welsh-is-working-on-a-trainspotting-musical">recently confirmed</a> that he’s working on a stage musical version of <em>Trainspotting</em>, with ambitions for a West End debut. “We’re looking at doing it about a year from now at the earliest,” the writer said of the production last month.</p>
<p>In the meantime, revisit Dazed’s 2017 interview with Danny Boyle and the original <em>Trainspotting</em> cast <a href="/artsandculture/article/34509/1/trainspotting-t2-danny-boyle-casting-out-demons">here</a>.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54975</id><title type="text">Berlin’s techno DJs are seeking Unesco world heritage status</title><summary type="html">Pioneers of the genre are calling on the UN to recognise its historical impact and help preserve a ‘free, wild, creative Berlin’</summary><published>2021-12-05T14:54:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-05T14:54:00Z</updated><author><name>Thom Waite</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/54975/1/berlin-techno-djs-seeking-unesco-world-heritage-status-rave-the-planet-berghain?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=berlin-s-techno-djs-are-seeking-unesco-world-heritage-status" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[





<h1 class="fl-title">Berlin’s techno DJs are seeking Unesco world heritage status</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Pioneers of the genre are calling on the UN to recognise its historical impact and help preserve a ‘free, wild, creative Berlin’</h3>

<p>Last year, Germany’s financial high court <a href="/music/article/51099/1/a-german-court-has-ruled-that-techno-is-in-fact-music-berlin-club-berghain">officially ruled</a> that (as we all already knew) <a href="/techno">techno</a> is a genre of music, resulting in a vital tax cut for the country’s clubs as they reopened in the wake of nationwide coronavirus lockdowns. However, techno’s biggest supporters aren’t stopping there; now, they’re seeking world heritage status.</p>
<p>Launched by Dr. Motte — a pioneer of the genre responsible for Love Parade and 2020’s <a href="https://www.ravetheplanet.com/en/">Rave the Planet</a> — a new campaign specifically calls on Unesco to grant <a href="/berlin">Berlin</a> techno “<a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/convention">intangible cultural heritage</a>” status (ICH), in recognition of the genre’s unifying influence on the city after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>“It would mean that the government and authorities have to help the culture continue,” Motte tells <a href="https://djmag.com/longreads/can-unesco-help-safeguard-techno-culture"><em>DJ Mag</em></a>. “It would mean easier access to money from the state for support... if we have that status, we could support clubs with lower taxes, and it could affect building and trading laws.”</p>
<p>ICH is more typically granted to niche cultural subjects, from Swiss dry stone walling to the art of the Byzantine chant (though Jamaican reggae was added to the <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/lists">list</a> of recognised practices in 2018). It could help provide stability for techno, however, as it faces the threat of ongoing COVID restrictions. Just this week, Berlin <a href="/music/article/54969/1/berlin-has-banned-dancing-in-clubs-berghain-covid-omicron-coronavirus-germany">announced a ban on dancing</a> in nightclubs in an effort to curb transmission of the virus.</p><p>It would also help preserve a “free, wild, creative Berlin” in the face of <a href="/life-culture/article/47991/1/clubs-in-berlin-are-asking-parliament-for-protection-against-gentrification">rapid gentrification</a> and wide-scale <a href="/life-culture/article/47724/1/griessmuehle-berlin-mourns-the-loss-of-yet-another-club-cocktail-d-amore">club closures</a>, according to Detroit DJ Alan Oldham. “Unesco protection would go a long way towards maintaining that old spirit,” Oldham tells the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/05/beat-that-berlins-techno-djs-seek-unesco-world-heritage-status"><em>Observer</em></a>. “Legacy venues like <a href="/music/article/13553/1/tresor-berlin-to-london">Tresor</a> and <a href="/berghain">Berghain</a> for example would be protected as cultural landmarks.”</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Berghain already won <a href="/artsandculture/article/32809/1/berghain-recognised-as-high-art-by-german-law-ruling">a legal case</a> that saw it designated a “high art” venue back in 2016, granting it the lower tax rate of venues that peddle “high culture”, such as classical music halls.</p>
<p>Obtaining cultural heritage status from Unesco is an even bigger challenge, however. Despite the fact that the UN body “seems supportive” regarding the initial application, Motte suggests that it could take “two, five or 10 years to get a final outcome”. </p>
<p>The campaign’s ambition also stretches far beyond the Berlin city limits. “To get to the status of Unesco Intangible Cultural Heritage for techno in Germany, this is what we want to work towards,” Motte explains. “And then Europe. But first, we start in Berlin.”</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>What brings together <a href="/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a>, <a href="/science-tech/article/53900/1/elon-musk-is-unleashing-humanoid-tesla-bots-into-the-world">Tesla</a>, 90s grunge, and <a href="/hbo">HBO</a>’s <em>Succession</em>? If you answered <a href="/courtney-love">Courtney Love</a>’s latest Twitter post, then congratulations: the former <a href="/hole">Hole</a> frontwoman has taken to the platform to call out <a href="/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> over his reply to the Vermont senator and <a href="/politics/article/51712/1/inauguration-memes-that-prove-bernie-sanders-is-the-president-of-our-hearts">winter style icon</a> last month.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Bernie Sanders publicly called for the wealthiest US citizens to pay a fair amount of taxes in a November 14 tweet that read: “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period.”</p>
<p>Obviously, Elon Musk — AKA the “richest person in the history of the world”, according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizahaverstock/2021/10/26/elon-musk-nearing-300-billion-fortune-is-the-richest-person-in-history/?sh=709ce91c1933"><em>Forbes</em></a> — had some strong feelings about this statement, which, as always, he dealt with in a very mature manner. “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive,” he writes in response to Bernie’s post.</p>
<p>Now, Courtney Love has seemingly stumbled across last month’s Twitter exchange, and she’s having none of it. Sharing a screenshot of Musk’s reply, she’s directly called out the <a href="/spacex">SpaceX</a> founder in a new tweet, claiming that she was bcc’d on his “str8, male, PayPal mafia email group” for months.</p>
<p>“With that information in mind, don’t you think in a ‘civilized society’ one should embrace paying our fair share of tax?” she goes on. “Don’t pick on Bernie.”</p><p>“It’s Kendall Roy shit,” the musician adds, in reference to the <em>Succession</em> character (having previously shown her love for the show by approving its use of <a href="/kurt-cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>’s <a href="/nirvana">Nirvana</a> track “Rape Me” in season three).</p>
<p>Despite the lingering threat of Love having access to Musk’s “PayPal mafia” messages — a threat she acknowledges with a sly teapot emoji — it seems that she doesn’t intend on actually spilling the tea, however. “Relax. I’m a GOOD Queen,” she continues. “Capitalism amp; the American dream has been good to you. Be good to it. #justpayyourtaxesbuddy.”</p>
<p>Besides, Courtney Love has plenty of legal issues on her plate already, including the <a href="/music/article/53971/1/the-nirvana-baby-nevermind-lawsuit-is-likely-to-be-dismissed-lawyers-say">ongoing lawsuit</a> filed by Spencer Elden, who posed as a <a href="/music/article/54872/1/baby-on-nirvana-nevermind-cover-was-depicted-as-hugh-hefner-kurt-cobain-journal">stark naked baby</a> for Nirvana’s <em>Nevermind</em> album cover. In the lawsuit, Love is named as a defendant alongside other managers of Cobain’s estate, and surviving band members <a href="/music/article/54606/1/dave-grohl-weighs-in-on-nirvana-s-naked-baby-album-cover-lawsuit">Dave Grohl</a> and Krist Novoselic.</p>

<p>In <a href="/film-tv/article/51488/1/watch-the-trailer-for-charlie-brooker-mockumentary-death-to-2020-netflix"><em>Death to 2020</em></a>, <a href="/charlie-brooker">Charlie Brooker</a> summed up a year so dystopian that “even the creators of <a href="/tag/black-mirror"><em>Black Mirror</em></a> couldn’t make it up”, enlisting the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Hugh Grant for the cathartic <a href="/netflix">Netflix</a> comedy.</p>
<p>Now, Netflix has announced <em>Death to</em> 2021, another satirical year-in-review backed by Brooker (because let’s face it, things haven’t gotten too much better over the last 12 months). Set to arrive on the streaming service later this month, the mockumentary will once again blend archival footage with commentary from fictional characters. </p>
<p>A new teaser clip shows returning cast member Diane Morgan as Gemma Nerrick, who’s says she’s taken up cuddling dates through Zoom, instead of “crying on my own all night, and all day, and at weekends”.</p><p>Other previous cast members that are set to make an appearance in the new show include Grant, Tracey Ullman, Samson Kayo, Cristin Milioti, and Joe Keery. New additions include Lucy Liu, Stockard Channing (of <em>Grease </em>fame), Nick Mohammed (<em>Ted Lasso</em>), and WIlliam Jackson Harper (<a href="/tag/midsommar"><em>Midsommar</em></a>).</p>
<p>Brooker’s production company Broke amp; Bones is once again behind the satire, though Ben Caudell has taken over writing duties from the <em>Black Mirror </em>creator. Caudell will also executive produce alongside previous producer Annabel Jones.</p>
<p><em>Death to 2021 </em>is slated to premiere on Netflix December 27.

<p>For their upcoming <a href="/netflix">Netflix</a> documentary, <a href="/music/article/52414/1/a-decades-spanning-kanye-west-documentary-lands-at-netflix"><em>Jeen-Yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy</em></a>, filmmakers Coodie Simmons and Chike Ozah followed <a href="/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>’s career for more than two decades, capturing “both his formative days trying to break through and his life today as a global brand and artist”.</p>
<p>Ahead of the three-part film’s release in 2022, the pair have discussed the process of documenting the life and career of the <a href="/music/article/53974/1/kanye-west-finally-drops-donda-and-the-jay-z-verse-is-here-to-stay"><em>Donda</em></a> rapper (now <a href="/music/article/53947/1/kanye-west-is-officially-changing-his-name-to-ye-donda-childhood-home">officially named</a> Ye) in a “director on director” conversation for the streaming giant’s <em>Netflix Playlist</em> showcase.</p>
<p>“We were at the right place at the right time, all the time,” says Simmons, who recalls meeting Ye as a “talented” kid at a Chicago barbershop. “The first time Kanye did a song with <a href="/jay-z">Jay-Z</a>, we’re documenting that. The first time Kanye let <a href="/pharrell-williams">Pharrell</a> hear ‘Through the Wire’, we’re right there.”</p>
<p>The collaborators also discuss how they worked on the “Through the Wire” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvb-1wjAtk4">music video</a>, with Simmons incorporating footage of West’s car accident recovery from the documentary project, and bringing in Ozah (then working at MTV) to piece it together.</p><p>“There’s a whole history lesson of music that’s happening,” says Ozah, discussing the wide scope of <em>Jeen-Yuhs</em>. “We’re crossing generations… At the end of the film, Kanye’s collaborating with artists that were babies. The crazy part is, Kanye’s a through-line. He’s still as relevant at the end as he is in the beginning.”</p>
<p>Described as a “faith-based documentary”, <em>Jeen-Yuhs </em>apparently makes use of 267 hours of footage, which Simmons sifted through during quarantine, saying: “It was just in a big duffle bag.” When he started looking, however, he adds that “the story just directed itself”.</p>
<p>In a first look at the documentary <a href="/music/article/54299/1/a-first-look-at-the-intimate-kanye-west-documentary-coming-to-netflix-jeen-yuhs">released in September</a> this year, we see a young Kanye rapping <a href="/music/article/18333/1/the-tenth-birthday-of-kanye-wests-college-dropout"><em>The College Dropout</em></a>’s “Two Words” alongside collaborator <a href="/mos-def">Mos Def</a>. Other notable subjects reportedly include his<a href="/music/article/50981/1/kanye-west-concedes-2020-election-says-hes-running-in-2024"> ill-fated presidential run</a> in 2020, as well as the 2007 death of his mother, who was more recently commemorated in visuals for “<a href="/music/article/54211/1/watch-kanye-west-new-visuals-for-donda-chant-chicago-listening-party">Donda Chant</a>”.</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="/netflix">Netflix</a> shared the first full trailer for Adam McKay’s <a href="/film-tv/article/54811/1/jonah-hill-dont-look-up-leonardo-dicaprio-jennifer-lawrence-timothee-chalamet"><em>Don’t Look Up</em></a>, showing two small-time astronomers (played by <a href="/leonardo-dicaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href="/jennifer-lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a>) on a hopeless mission to warn Earth’s inhabitants about their impending doom. </p>
<p>Now, <a href="/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> and <a href="/kid-cudi">Kid Cudi</a> have shared their soundtrack for the apocalypse, a pop ballad (and desperate plea to “get your head out of your ass”) titled “Just Look Up”, which has been tipped as a best original song contender at the <a href="/oscars">Oscars</a>.</p>
<p>Both musicians will make cameo appearances in the forthcoming disaster comedy, which also features performances by <a href="/timothee-chalamet">Timothée Chalamet</a>, Mark Rylance, and <a href="/cate-blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>. The president and her chief of staff — who dismiss the astronomers’ claims about an approaching comet in a <a href="/film-tv/article/54061/1/timothee-chalamet-ariana-grande-leonardo-dicaprio-kid-cudi-teaser-dont-look-up">teaser</a> released in September — are played by Meryl Streep and <a href="/jonah-hill">Jonah Hill</a>, respectively.</p>
<p>“This guy was the grossest blast I’ve ever had,” Hill <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CTlXs9vlgS8/?utm_source=ig_embed">wrote</a> of his slimy, <a href="/fashion/article/54066/1/jonah-hill-barron-trump-dont-look-up-handbag-style-evolution-meryl-streep">badly-dressed</a> role earlier this year. “I thought, what if <a href="/fyre-festival">Fyre Festival</a> was a person and that person had power in the White House.”</p><p>In a statement on the newly-released <em>Don’t Look Up </em>track, <a href="/tag/moonlight"><em>Moonlight</em></a> and <a href="/film-tv/article/48188/1/brian-cox-interview-dazed-spring-2020-issue"><em>Succession</em></a> composer Nicholas Britell says: “It was a privilege to collaborate with Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi, and Taura Stinson on our song ‘Just Look Up’, a love song that transforms into a rallying cry.”</p>
<p>“Many of the projects that I’ve worked on with Adam McKay are, in their own way, explorations of tone as a central topic — they’re all a unique blend of gravitas and absurdity.” Previous collaborations between McKay and Britell include the acclaimed features <em>The Big Short </em>and <em>Vice</em>.</p>
<p><em>Don’t Look Up</em>, he adds, captures “a sense of ever-increasing astonishment at how crazy things really are.”</p>

<p>As of Wednesday, December 8, Berliners will no longer be allowed to dance inside nightclubs. </p>
<p>In a bid to minimise the transmission of <a href="/tag/coronavirus">COVID</a> amid the spread of the Omicron variant, the Senate of Berlin is enforcing a ban on dancing inside nightclubs and imposing a strict maximum limits on large events – TBH, it’s hard to picture clubbers swaying gently to Marcel Dettmann banging out techno.</p>
<p>As well as making cutting shapes <em>verboten</em>, clubbers have also been advised to limit contact with other people.The “2G rule” also applies everywhere for nightlife in Berlin, referring to Germany’s large-scale events and nightlife guidelines which require patrons to hold one of two “Gs” (either 'geimpft', ie. vaccinated, or ‘genesen’, having had a positive test in the last six months).</p><p>The news comes after Germany's federal government said that all nightclubs in states with high infection rates must close. As the ban is only legally enforceable from next week, clubs are allowed to open this weekend at 50 per cent capacity.</p>
<p>“20 months of pandemic and no better idea than to ban dancing,” Clubcommission Berlin’s Lutz Leichsenring told <a href="https://ra.co/news/76494"><em>RA</em></a>. “It doesn’t take much imagination to figure out that you can’t enforce a dance ban in party basements and private homes. Without 2G and without tests.” He continued: “No word about PCR tests, no data on level of infections assigned to clubs that justifies such massive restrictions.”</p>
<p>With no proposed end date for the ban in sight, it looks like this weekend will be the Last Dance for Berlin residents.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">New Music Friday: 7 albums to stream this week</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Arca expands on her KiCk series with a staggering four albums, No Rome reveals his long-awaited debut, and Tierra Whack drops a dynamic EP</h3>

	</figure>
<p>Ever the pop maximalist, <a href="/tag/arca">Arca</a> has expanded on her <em>KiCK</em> series with not one, but four new albums. Stretched across a 145 minutes, <em>KICK ii</em>, <em>KicK iii</em>, <em>kick iiii</em>, and <em>kiCK iiiii</em> follow on from 2020’s Grammy nominated <em>KiCK i</em> – which starred the likes of <a href="/tag/bjork">Björk</a>, <a href="/tag/sophie">SOPHIE</a>, and <a href="/tag/rosalia">Rosalía</a>, and features 47 songs in total. It’s a lot to take in, but then again, Arca has never been one for subtlety. Her 2020 single “@@@@@”, after all, spanned a sprawling 62 minutes, while her official remix album featured a staggering 100 tracks – all of them variations of the same song.</p>
<p>Put aside the biblical feat and this latest drop is Arca’s most pop-centric and accessible music to date. Drawing on a vast sonic palette, <em>KICK ii </em>takes its primary cues from reggaetón. Built on swinging dembow rhythms, Arca’s voice is pulled and stretched to its synthetic extremes. Described by the artist as “mutant club music”, <em>KicK iii </em>is considerably harsher: filthy experimentalism built for the darkest corners of a club. In contrast, <em>kick iiii </em>is ethereal, drawing on celestial shimmers and airy textures to conjure a rich soundscape rooted in futurism, while <em>kiCK iiiii</em>’s ambient, pared-back instrumentals are positioned against a cyborgian choir of vocals that pull the listener gently back down to Earth.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, No Rome reveals his long-awaited debut, <a href="/music/article/44697/1/tierra-whack-2019-interview">Tierra Whack</a> drops a dynamic EP, and Nolanberollin’s album is must-hear rap for the weekend. </p><h2>ARCA, <em>KICK II, III, IIII, IIIII</em></h2><h2>LIL PEEP, <em>HIGH FASHION</em></h2><h2>NO ROME,<em> IT’S ALL SMILES</em></h2><h2>NOLANBEROLLIN, <em>NAPALM_VIRTUALGO</em></h2><h2>RIVAL CONSOLES, <em>OVERFLOW</em></h2><h2>TIERRA WHACK, <em>RAP?</em></h2><h2>YUNG BEEF, <em>GANGSTER ORIGINAL</em></h2>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54967</id><title type="text">Get ready for RuPaul’s Drag Race’s first ever straight, cis male queen</title><summary type="html">Arkansas’ Maddy Morphosis is set to compete in season 14</summary><published>2021-12-03T15:34:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-03T15:34:00Z</updated><author><name>Mae Williams</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/54967/1/get-ready-rupaul-drag-race-first-ever-straight-cis-male-queen-maddy-morphosis?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=get-ready-for-rupaul-s-drag-race-s-first-ever-straight-cis-male-queen" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p><em><a href="/tag/rupaul">RuPaul</a>’s <a href="/tag/drag-race">Drag Race</a></em> is set to have its first ever straight, cis male queen, as Arkansas’ Maddy Morphosis is joining the competition for season 14. </p>
<p>Although <em>Drag Race UK</em> previously had a contestant with a girlfriend – season one’s Scaredy Kat – Maddy will be the first queen to outwardly identify as straight. The move continues the franchise’s attempt to become more inclusive, following criticism of its lack of diversity (and RuPaul’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/rupaul-drag-race-big-f-you-to-male-dominated-culture">2018 transphobic comments</a>).</p><p>Trans performers have appeared in the show, including season nine’s Peppermint, season 13’s Gottmik, and <em>All Stars</em> season six winner Kylie Sonique Love. This year, the UK’s season three featured the <a href="/film-tv/article/53875/1/rupaul-drag-race-uk-casts-the-franchises-first-ever-cis-woman">first ever cis woman contestant</a>, Victoria Scone.</p>

<p>Trust <a href="/tag/jacquemus">Jacquemus</a> to engineer an Instagrammable vending machine in the middle of Paris. Across the weekend, fans of Simon can score the designer’s accessories much like they would a Snickers, a Lucozade Orange, or a packet of Durex. The 24 hour locale can be found on rue de Richelieu and hawks the arrival of the label’s new bag – The Bambino Long.  “The idea is to break boundaries in the luxury world,” the designer said. “That’s what Jacquemus is about”. Of course, Jacquemus has imagined his It-bags as convenience foods for a while, having acquired a Chiquito vending machine for his AW20 campaign. It’s not just bags, though, with 90 automated lockers and a McDonalds-style serving screen shilling pieces from the label’s Pink 2 capsule which also launched this week. Think bucket hats, scarves, and the Rond Carré candle (a collaboration with Belgian artist Ann Vincent). Anyone got any change?</p>

<p>Dublin-based creative management agency and production company <a href="https://notanotherintl.com/">Not Another Intl</a>’s short film, titled <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW_IgYeFGtn/"><em>FACES</em></a>, is a testament to <a href="/tag/ireland">Ireland</a>’s percolating social landscape. Directed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/saorlahouston/?hl=en">Saorla Houston</a> and produced by Not Another Intl, the two-and-a-half minute film champions the diverse experiences and identities of a modern Ireland – as told by a portfolio of the agency’s unique talent, spanning all ages, ethnicities, and identities.</p>
<p>“For me, modeling is about pushing boundaries,” says model Mark Gilleran in the opening line of the film. “I try to change people’s minds, not conform to what people expect to see on the screen.” </p><p>Through kaleidoscopic angles and intimate interviews, <em>FACES</em> spotlights eight of the agency’s new board of models as they share thoughts about their heritage, insecurities growing up, modeling, and hopes for a more diverse Ireland. “The landscape, culture and population of Ireland has changed considerably in recent years, and is constantly evolving,” Not Another Intl says. “Yet this evolution is rarely seen, depicted or illustrated correctly in the creative output of the country.”</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>“Not Another Intl was founded six years ago on this principle. To showcase what we saw around us and to bring the industry into the new age. The FACES board is the latest evolution of this.”</p>
<p>In the film, Debbie opens up about her personal experience growing up in Ireland. “Obviously being Black in a predominantly white country, that was tough for me growing up,” she says. Meanwhile, Sinead reflects on her younger self. “I guess when I was younger, I always wanted to conform and have straight hair,” she says, while proudly displaying her curls. “It was a different phase of my life.” </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is absolutely vital we ensure Ireland is a place that advocates and stands for diversity, ensuring (that) people feel welcomed and championed here” – Not Another Intl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“A lot of people look at me and stare and have the worst expression or ideas about me,” says Hispanic and Indian model Venus Patel, commenting on their experience living in Dublin. Later on, the model lists what they love about themselves, stating: “Funky, colourful, and fairy-like.”</p>
<p>Towards the end of the film, Ayo explains how they tackle insecurities. “It’s kind of just attacking (it) head on, letting myself define how I want to be perceived and not letting how other people perceive me influence what I know I am,” they say. Afterwards, Dara explains his own notion of beauty. “(It’s) beyond a physical thing, not even in terms of standards, but it’s beyond how we appear,” he says. “It’s who we are, it’s what we do in this life that we’re given.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Not Another Intl is incisive about the potency of these stories, as well as their ability to create changes in the modeling industry on par with Ireland’s constantly evolving culture and the global fashion landscape. “It is absolutely vital we ensure Ireland is a place that advocates and stands for diversity, ensuring (that) people feel welcomed and championed here,” they say, explaining that brands and agencies share a duty in showcasing the country’s diverse talent, educating others, and creating dialogues that broadens the common consciousness.</p>
<p>“This film is a celebration,” they add. “It’s true essence is honouring diversity as something authentic and beautiful... And for those who ever personally felt the need to conform in order to feel like they belonged here – to know that this is a celebration of them.” </p>

<p>Five years after directing <a href="/artsandculture/article/34609/1/20th-century-women-film-mike-mills-elle-fanning" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/34609/1/20th-century-women-film-mike-mills-elle-fanningamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1638454595622000amp;usg=AOvVaw2fMyBlRTdnXXHaZ-0CQccp"><em>20th Century Women</em></a>, <a href="/tag/mike-mills">Mike Mills</a> has returned with a poignant meditation on 21st century children. Shot evocatively in hustling, bustling, pre-pandemic cities, Mills’ fourth feature, <em>C’mon C’mon</em>, stars <a href="/tag/joaquin-phoenix">Joaquin Phoenix</a> as a radio journalist, Johnny, who forms an unlikely bond with his nine-year-old nephew, Jesse (Woody Norman). Interspersed within the delicate, witty drama are Johnny’s interviews with real children speaking of the future: their hopes, their fears, their sincere responses to Phoenix’s journalism style. One example of a question: if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?</p>
<p>On the week of the film’s theatrical release in the UK, I ask Mills, over Zoom, if he also considers <em>C’mon C’mon</em> to be a story about 21st century children. “Not really,” the 55-year-old director says from his home in LA. “That’s too big. But maybe you’re right. <em>20th Century Women</em> was based on very specific women from my life, but by calling it that, I was trying to talk about <em>women</em>, or expand the individual experience I’d been with to a broader thing.” <em>C’mon C’mon</em>, similarly, was inspired by Mill’s family. “My kid started as my kid, then grew into his own planet. But I wanted to talk about much more than our little private experience. I was trying to make the connection between our private intimacy and this much larger, societal image of kids.”</p><p>Mills has formed a pattern of writing about his relatives, often half a decade apart. 2010’s <a href="/artsandculture/article/10935/1/mike-mills-begins-again" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/10935/1/mike-mills-begins-againamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1638454595622000amp;usg=AOvVaw3Sgd3M9ohTRHn7BN0mpEmg"><em>Beginners</em></a>, starring Ewan McGregor, was partly about how his father came out as gay after his mother’s death. With 2016’s <em>20th Century Women</em>, an ensemble comedy starring <a href="/tag/elle-fanning">Elle Fanning</a>, <a href="/tag/greta-gerwig">Greta Gerwig</a>, and Annette Bening, Mills paid tribute to his mother and the other female figures of his childhood. However, despite the critical acclaim of <em>20th Century Women</em> – Mills’ screenplay received an Oscar nomination – the writer/director felt depressed in a country that had just elected Donald Trump as its President. So he turned to Wim Wenders’ <em>Alice in the Cities</em>, a gorgeous, monochrome drama from 1974, for repeat comfort viewing.</p>
<p>Whereas <em>20th Century Women</em> is brightly lit and opens with a burning car – even Gerwig’s hair is dyed glow-in-the-dark red – <em>C’mon C’mon</em> is lensed in black-and-white, paying homage to Wenders’ collaborations with cinematographer Robby Müller and framing Phoenix as a classical movie star. Yet <em>C’mon C’mon</em> feels extremely modern. The Wenders movie I sensed a closer connection with is <em>Wings of Desire</em>, in which voiceovers reveal Berlin to be populated with silently anxious citizens – a similar effect to Johnny’s interviews with children across America.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="8we9OJ6IDDg"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8we9OJ6IDDg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>“I <em>lurve</em> those two Wim Wenders movies,” Mills says. “<em>Wings of Desire</em> has influenced all my movies. That contemplative quality. What exactly is the plot? The plot’s not really what’s interesting about that movie. It’s the thinking out loud: the considering, the asking.” He compares the drone shots of <em>C’mon C’mon</em> to Wenders’ use of helicopters. “You have the individual and then – whoosh. That individual is still there, but it’s this expandable look at it all.”</p>
<p>Like Wender’s early work, <em>C’mon C’mon</em> is a warm, profound movie with a logline that sounds less thrilling on paper. While an uncle/nephew road trip may sound like a Sundance quirkathon, Mills and his stellar cast keep the drama grounded and uncover cinematic poetry in how loneliness can be cured by curiosity. It’s aided, too, by Mill’s lyrical editing: scenes unfold as snippets of conversations, as if extracted from real-life moments. By doing so, the believable messiness of Johnny’s family is teased out in increments, sketching out a complicated situation involving siblings who struggle to explain why they refused to speak to each other for a year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My kid started as my kid, then grew into his own planet. But I wanted to talk about much more than our little private experience. I was trying to make the connection between our private intimacy and this much larger, societal image of kids” – Mike Mills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That all changes when Viv (Gaby Hoffman), a single mother in LA, asks her brother, Jonny, for a favour. Viv’s estranged husband has fallen ill, and so Johnny flies over from New York to care for Jesse. At Johnny’s suggestion, Jesse then joins his uncle on work trips in New York and New Orleans to interview 21st century children. In a reverse of roles, Jesse pesters Jonny with direct questions (“Why aren’t you married?” “Why did you and my mother stop talking?”) that adults don’t usually pose. Although Jonny’s peers code their language with politics and etiquette, the kids of <em>C’mon C’mon</em> speak more honestly and from the heart – their words thus carry more resonance.</p>
<p>“I live with a kid,” Mills explains. “It’s my favourite way to write. I’m hearing little bits. I’m around it – not just my kid, but the others kids at school, and all my friends’ kids. Woody’s the end-arbiter of everything that character says. If Woody felt there was something bogus or BS-y, I would be like, ‘Thank you for helping me make it better.’” One of Jesse’s hobbies is to pretend to be an orphan and force the adult, whether Viv or Johnny, to roleplay as a grieving parent who’s seeking a new child. “I got the orphan game from (The National’s) Aaron Dessner’s daughter, Ingrid. I asked her, ‘Tell me exactly all the steps of it.’ She did it in a voice memo. I transferred that into the script.”</p>	<figure>

<p>While Ira Glass is thanked in the credits, Mills denies that Johnny is an amalgamation of himself and the NPR radio icon. “Maybe at the beginning,” Mills says. “I do love <em>This American Life</em>, and I’ve done documentary work.” Instead, Phoenix was drawn to the likes of Pulitzer-winning broadcaster and author Studs Terkel. “Joaquin’s really different. And that’s what I love about him. Johnny is his own creation. It doesn’t feel super-me at all.”</p>
<p><em>C’mon C’mon</em> was Phoenix’s first acting gig after <em>Joker</em> and, though the actor has said otherwise, Johnny largely feels like the inverse of a crazed, starved clown with a hideous wardrobe. Phoenix’s talent has always been to depict characters in the moment – so much so, you don’t believe he’s performing – but Mill’s seemingly off-the-cuff filming style truly captures the actor with a humanity so warm, so believable, and so strong that you almost want to hug the screen. The contradiction is that Phoenix can always “play himself”, so to speak, yet never repeats himself from project to project.</p>
<p>“I’m going to tell him that,” Mills says. “That’s accurate. What Joaquin does, I’m not going to pretend I understand. It’s deep, weird stuff that he does. He’s very funny. On set, he’s a total joy, and amazingly good at not acting. He finds a way so that he’s not putting anything on. He’s feeling all that stuff, which is a trippy job, and never forcing it, or faking it, or making something happen. That’s really strong, especially for a lead actor who everyone adores, to react and relax into it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What Joaquin does, I’m not going to pretend I understand. It’s deep, weird stuff that he does. He’s very funny” – Mike Mills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To lose weight for <em>Joker</em>, Phoenix allegedly only ate apples and asparagus. Did he have any similarly painful methods to emulate the depraved lifestyle of a journalist? “No, I think he’s really smart about changing his process. This film didn’t need stuff like that. But him and (Radiolab producer) Molly Webster did radio interviews to prepare. And we talked for months and months and months about the script… his process was not method-y at all.”</p>
<p>While Mills directed music videos for the likes of Pulp, Air, and Yoko Ono before moving into features with 2005’s <em>Thumbsucker</em>, he considers his background to be more rooted in graphic design – he did posters and album covers for artists such as Sonic Youth and the Beastie Boys. His script for <em>20th Century Women</em> is thus uniquely formatted with columns for montages (“it felt better to do dual dialogue for the audio and the visuals”) and he carries other idiosyncrasies onto his film sets.</p>
<p>For instance, crew members wear a name tag that changes every day depending on a rotating question: the name of your memoir; your <em>Sesame Street</em> name; if you prefer The Beatles of The Rolling Stones. Gerwig was so impressed by the positive vibes it generated, she adopted the practice for <em>Lady Bird</em>. “I try many ways to enchant the set,” Mills explains. “Every film of mine begins with a blessing from some Buddhist monks. The whole crew’s there. You’re asking the film gods to come help you, right?</p>	<figure>

<p>“And I play music a lot. I have live musicians sometimes, like a French horn or violin, or I’ll play music off my phone on a speaker, but all day long, between every scene. It helps the set and the world you’re in not feel like a job. Music is the most magically powerful of the arts. I literally believe that I’m summoning magic to be in the same space that we’re shooting, and it totally works.”</p>
<p>Mills’ kinship with music is reflected in the drama’s hypnotic rhythm, which he obsessively edited during lockdown, at home, with a few pointers from famous friends, such as Joachim Trier, the Norwegian filmmaker behind <em>The Worst Person in the World</em>. “He watched multiple cuts and gave me notes,” Mills says. “I just had lunch with him yesterday. He’s so smart and so wickedly articulate. One of the smartest directors I know.”</p>
<p>The bounciness of the film – it jumps back and forth to depict memories both traumatic and positive – also details the multiple perspectives around its primary themes: raising a child, mental health, and grief. There are no right answers for, say, how Viv deals with the mental health crisis of her husband, with whom she’s also separated, or how much discipline is required for a harmless child whose biggest crimes are demanding ice cream for dinner and running off in busy streets. When Johnny turns to Google for parenting advice, Jesse recognises his uncle’s semi-scripted vocabulary – his mother uses the internet, too.</p>
<p>“My understanding of reality and families – obviously when I say family, I don’t mean biological; it’s whoever’s there in your life that’s with you, that’s taking care of you – is that the spectrum of health, and what’s considered positive and negative, is so crazy and varied, and all happening at the same time. The spectrum of whether you’re a good, helpful, productive parent – it’s a chaotic loop of well/not well; positive/not positive; executing something you didn’t intend.</p>	<figure>

<p>“I hope I’m ambiguous and non-judgemental. I’m sure a smart person can look at my movie and point out eight different ways I’m being judgemental and a fuck.” He laughs. “I would like not to be, though.”</p>
<p>If Mills has tackled his mother, his father, and his child, what’s next? His long-term relationship with fellow filmmaker, Miranda July? “Marriage? Is that your guess? I’m going to put it on a list for the people guessing.” The director claims to have nothing planned for the moment, joking, “I have a very cute dog. Maybe the dog will get a movie. It will be in Claymation, and it will be great.”</p>
<p>Over the end credits, Mills plays out an audio montage of kids open-heartedly responding to Phoenix’s philosophical questions, so I finish the interview by throwing one back at him: if you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be? “Only one?! I’m not going to do something magical like be younger. I like my age. I just don’t want to die!” Mills laughs, then considers his answer. “I’m going to tell you something I got from Joaquin. Joaquin is very dextrous and fluid and comfortable with his flaws and disappointments. He knows the measure of them, and how to live with them. It’s really empowering and beautiful.</p>
<p>“If you’re like me, and you’re worried about letting people down, and worried about anyone thinking not great things about you, and you want to impress and always lead with your best qualities – that’s just lame. It’s not really an expansive, awesome way to move through the world. I’d be more in touch and owning my flaws in a way that’s admitting them – with humour and buoyancy.”</p>

<p>Corporate millennials make up a whole subsection of their generation. Not only have they created an entirely new vocabulary for themselves (think: girlboss, burnout, side hustle), but they’re the first generation to experience working from home as the norm. Gone are the days when professional success looks like a 7AM commute into work, followed by an intense day at the office, and then drinking your colleagues under the table at the pub when 6PM hits. An impressive lifestyle within the corporate world nowadays mostly involves at-home pilates, a standing desk, and a subscription to HelloFresh. Although young people might romanticise the working worlds they see in <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/wolfofwallstreet?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8wcApzdVXZG4wzEE6CkQU1xwXIrwp9i4mWOVgrlMm%2BxppbI6S%2Ftn5zKoebJ%2Bk4DMnrZv1ukEEscNG4FFGGgA%3Damp;checksum=4752bb68b72c512699126f35b60d03f65caba868d0cec192913c0d19da1e98fdamp;language=enamp;name=wolfofwallstreetamp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZG3VMp3umn-Ya0hItPF3HZqhbGDZVDXCd6uDlxmy8F9Ltee5Sc_AX-hRmeJ6dqUCamp;share_app_id=1233amp;share_challenge_id=656411amp;share_link_id=11E8EE47-7CB0-4DF3-ADD8-1535A77B7F32amp;source=h5_mamp;tt_from=smsamp;u_code=dck2gl8agk4944amp;user_id=6834617738339894277amp;utm_campaign=client_shareamp;utm_medium=iosamp;utm_source=smsamp;_r=1">films like <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em></a>, in reality, their corporate lifestyles look nothing like Jordan Belfort’s (and neither do their salaries).</p>
<p>The idea of a ‘young professional’ has taken on a whole new meaning in recent years, and the 20 and 30-somethings who make up this demographic have taken to TikTok to try and define it. The tag #CorporateTikTok has over 300 million views on the app, and if you click on it you’ll find <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maddiealbon/video/7021859324322483461?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8sIPYV%2BJhzLp09Ebh%2FdIjSjWZXtsU1CLXU552aOBkuAgo%2FoCytcJd6JlpTqbafjV%2Bprbq961tdWQrCyD0GgA%3Damp;checksum=b69d54bbd9da4174640984ea9fd86814c44d62fdac34b3431bf84017ef885271amp;clips_cover_ab=v4amp;enable_clips=1amp;language=enamp;preview_pb=0amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZG3VMp3umn-Ya0hItPF3HZqhbGDZVDXCd6uDlxmy8F9Ltee5Sc_AX-hRmeJ6dqUCamp;share_app_id=1233amp;share_item_id=7021859324322483461amp;share_link_id=A64CB88D-9B15-43D2-9624-0E831B56F255amp;source=h5_mamp;timestamp=1636018527amp;tt_from=smsamp;u_code=dck2gl8agk4944amp;user_id=6834617738339894277amp;utm_campaign=client_shareamp;utm_medium=iosamp;utm_source=smsamp;_r=1">morning routines created by young people in corporate jobs</a> – often involving them getting up three hours before their working day starts – and employees using popular TikTok sounds to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@delyannethemoneycoach/video/7015664330624535814?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8mXMT%2B3Ubib1kOwfKl9nbef9tTQr1ucvisTBM6Op8%2FG%2FNx22wxKmJY64fOcQDBND7lkcYIXjR7TG9mMgfGgA%3Damp;checksum=4e190dc056d91639d93f2bf8de5beb0c1eac5a1c6376d668385f28c62fb698f6amp;clips_cover_ab=v4amp;enable_clips=1amp;language=enamp;preview_pb=0amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZG3VMp3umn-Ya0hItPF3HZqhbGDZVDXCd6uDlxmy8F9Ltee5Sc_AX-hRmeJ6dqUCamp;share_app_id=1233amp;share_item_id=7015664330624535814amp;share_link_id=8AC4153F-72B3-417B-8EE1-6E023F8E755Damp;source=h5_mamp;timestamp=1636018584amp;tt_from=smsamp;u_code=dck2gl8agk4944amp;user_id=6834617738339894277amp;utm_campaign=client_shareamp;utm_medium=iosamp;utm_source=smsamp;_r=1">mock their bosses</a>, point out the issues with working from home, or draw attention to their inadequate salaries.

It made Mariko one of TikTok’s biggest stars and the reason people love her so much is, simply, because she has her shit together.

The trend sees young (mostly white and thin) women documenting their fitness, nutrition, and work routines, and sharing tips about how to become #ThatGirl, i.e. a productive, beautiful, healthy (and ultimately, unrealistic) version of yourself.</p>
<p>The popularity of corporate ‘day in the lives’ makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Gen Z has popularised the idea of romanticising your life, and after nearly two years of sitting at home in front of a computer screen, it’s unsurprising that people in nine-to-five jobs are looking for ways to make their lives seem more appealing. One TikTok user manages to make it to the gym, take a walk in the park, blow dry her hair with a Dyson hairdryer, make a coffee, and listen to a podcast all before her working day starts at 8:45AM. Her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@maddiealbon/video/7021859324322483461?sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=6948701632394216965amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;is_copy_url=0">video</a> contains perfectly shot clips of each activity with a viral sound layered on top.</p><p>But many creators are also sharing some of the more realistic parts of their corporate job, like 27-year-old <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kenzomizumoto?">Kenzo Mizumoto</a>, who’s made a number of viral videos about the struggles of working maximum hours for minimal money in London. “At the company I used to work for, a lot of the salaries – especially for people in junior positions – were frozen for the whole pandemic,” he says, explaining that he quit his job at a music company in London two months ago to start creating TikTok content full-time.</p>
<p>“We offer free tap water on Sundays, no health insurance, and for every milestone you achieve, it’s either pizza or an Amazon voucher but never actual cash,” Kenzo says in one of his recent TikTok sketches, impersonating an employer interviewing candidates for an entry-level role.</p>
<p><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8tL4t9q/">Ania Magliano</a>, 23, also found herself in the ironic position of being able to quit her corporate job  thanks to the success of her TikTok content about her corporate job. “Making TikTok content about my job made me more cynical towards corporate jobs because it made me feel disillusioned with it, and I realised how empty a lot of the chat they spout out is,” she says. Ania made multiple videos mocking the ways in which companies handle events like International Women’s Day and Pride month with disingenuous box-ticking.</p><p>“There are some serious issues (with corporate culture), and I think TikTok can help get these issues noticed,” says Mark Jones, the founder of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tribeshake?_d=secCgwIARCbDRjEFSACKAESPgo8YkdOnsIiCBITTryM0lG4fqp%2BKk6aHePu0Sjno6jonlHGu9lc02%2Bn6jIXQE77I%2BZLhlN6Bl6%2BZyEH31dxGgA%3Damp;checksum=acaff1b9b78712bc05ad69d3e599564492c6c895e6bfcf357226dca9576e5716amp;enable_clips=1amp;language=enamp;sec_uid=MS4wLjABAAAAxGCbti8Qo9fgTOO90wewRBOffCV2Jz-VhAoOVmd8iWEEXs9OcIsxpP__UZRqnbZNamp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAZG3VMp3umn-Ya0hItPF3HZqhbGDZVDXCd6uDlxmy8F9Ltee5Sc_AX-hRmeJ6dqUCamp;share_app_id=1233amp;share_author_id=6904305956172645377amp;share_link_id=E9B3D2BA-49FB-4DC8-8BF2-548FB699994Camp;tt_from=smsamp;u_code=dck2gl8agk4944amp;user_id=6834617738339894277amp;utm_campaign=client_shareamp;utm_medium=iosamp;utm_source=smsamp;source=h5_mamp;_r=1">TribeShake</a>, a company helping startups reinvigorate their teams. TribeShake creates TikTok content to point out some of these issues, like employees’ wants being ignored when it comes to returning to the office, and the weaponisation of ‘wellbeing’ at work. </p>
<p>You might assume that employees would get in trouble for complaining about their work and their boss’ online, but apparently this isn’t the case. Kenzo and Ania agree that their colleagues and boss’ either enjoyed their content or never came across it. The same is true for LA-based <a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8tNjo1V/">Jenna Hushka</a>, one of the biggest creators within the world of corporate TikTok, with over six million likes on her videos. “I think it is refreshing that we can openly talk about and poke fun at real world situations,” she tells Dazed, adding: “We are so accustomed to thinking that our jobs are our personas.” Although Jenna’s content often points out the negative aspects of her job, she has found that creating it has made her happier in her role, as it has stopped her from being so defined by her work.</p><p>For Kenzo and Ania, however, becoming a part of this side of TikTok made them feel uncomfortable about working within the corporate world, encouraging them to get out of it for good. “If I was to go back into the corporate world – God forbid – I would (be able to see through the) jargon and would be more cynical about it, rather than instantly believing it like I did when I first got my job,” Ania says.</p>
<p>With the return to offices imminent within most companies, is corporate TikTok the revolutionary movement needed to overturn the capitalist hierarchies that are detrimental to young workers? Probably not. But if the content gets them through the working day… then they’ll be through with the working day (and will have more time to spend scrolling through TikTok).</p>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54965</id><title type="text">Watch a new, even more enigmatic trailer for The Matrix: Resurrections</title><summary type="html">‘Maybe this isn’t the story we think it is,’ suggests one character in the glitchy preview of the upcoming film</summary><published>2021-12-03T02:22:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-03T02:22:00Z</updated><author><name>Thom Waite</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/54965/1/watch-new-even-more-enigmatic-trailer-for-the-matrix-resurrections-keanu-reeves?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=watch-a-new-even-more-enigmatic-trailer-for-the-matrix-resurrections" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[





<h1 class="fl-title">Watch a new, even more enigmatic trailer for The Matrix: Resurrections</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">‘Maybe this isn’t the story we think it is,’ suggests one character in the glitchy preview of the upcoming film</h3>

<p>When the first official trailer for the fourth instalment of the <a href="/the-matrix"><em>Matrix</em></a> franchise arrived in September this year, it revealed little about the film’s plot, other than the return of Neo and Trinity, played by <a href="/keanu-reeves">Keanu Reeves</a> and Carrie-Anne Moss. If you were expecting the new trailer for <a href="/film-tv/article/53934/1/the-official-title-of-matrix-4-has-been-revealed"><em>The Matrix: Resurrections</em></a> to be any different, then you were sorely mistaken.</p>
<p>Soundtracked once again by Jefferson Airplane’s “White Rabbit”, the new preview splices together a range of scenes spanning the whole franchise, tied together by the concept of déjà vu (or, for the uninitiated, a glitch that happens when something is changed within the Matrix).</p>
<p>Among the scenes, we see characters at various ages, including Neo, Trinity, Agent Smith, Morpheus (as portrayed by Laurence Fishburne), and the elusive Merovingian, a figure from <em>The Matrix: Reloaded </em>and <em>The Matrix: Revolutions</em>.</p><p>Morpheus will also be played by <a href="/film-tv/article/53931/1/say-candyman-5-times-to-access-final-trailer-for-jordan-peele-nia-dacosta-reboot"><em>Candyman</em></a>’s Yahya Abdul-Mateen II in the new film, though the actor has similarly left us in the dark when describing his take on on the character. “This is definitely a different iteration of the character,” he told <a href="https://ew.com/movies/yahya-abdul-mateen-ii-morpheus-the-matrix-4/"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a> back in October. </p>
<p>“I play a character who's definitely aware of the history of the <em>Matrix</em> (and) the history of Morpheus,” he added. However, he kept the character’s exact role, and how he’s set to be reimagined in <em>The Matrix: Resurrections</em>, under wraps.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of information about the plot of the new <em>Matrix </em>film, director<strong> </strong><a href="/tag/lana-wachowski">Lana Wachowski</a> — who also wrote the script alongside authors David Mitchell and Aleksandar Hemon — has <a href="/film-tv/article/54129/1/matrix-director-lana-wachowski-resurrected-neo-and-trinity-for-comfort">expanded on her reasons</a> for revisiting Neo and Trinity, saying that it brought “comfort” in the wake of her parents’ deaths.</p>
<p><em>The Matrix: Resurrections </em>is set to be released in cinemas on December 22, and will also be available to stream on HBO Max.

<p><a href="/lady-gaga">Lady Gaga</a> wasn’t an established actor before her <a href="/film-tv/article/41289/1/a-star-is-born-film-lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-review">critically-acclaimed lead role</a> in <em>A Star Is Born</em>, but in 2001 she did appear — under her real name, Stefani Germanotta — in an episode of <a href="/the-sopranos"><em>The Sopranos</em></a>, titled “The Telltale Moozadell”.</p>
<p>Now promoting her latest film, <a href="/ridley-scott">Ridley Scott</a>’s high fashion crime drama <a href="/film-tv/article/54624/1/lady-gaga-new-trailer-house-of-gucci-adam-driver-ridley-scott"><em>House of Gucci</em></a>, she’s taken time to reflect on her acting debut, and where the pre-fame, 15-year-old Gaga was going wrong with her portrayal of “Girl at Swimming Pool #2”.</p>
<p>“When I look back on that scene I can see exactly what I did <em>wrong </em>in that scene,” says Gaga in a recent interview with <a href="https://ew.com/tv/lady-gaga-sopranos-scene/"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a>. “I didn’t know how to listen in a scene! I was supposed to laugh, and it was sort of like, cue, laugh… I see it and I go, ‘oh, that’s not a real laugh!’”</p><p>Of course, Lady Gaga has made some pretty significant acting developments since playing a rebellious schoolgirl on <em>The Sopranos</em>. Besides earning an Oscar nomination for Best Actress with <em>A Star Is Born</em>, her dedication to the craft saw her “<a href="/film-tv/article/54670/1/lady-gaga-lived-as-house-of-gucci-character-patrizia-reggiani-more-than-a-year">live as</a>” <em>House of Gucci</em>’s Patrizia Reggiani for more than a year, delivering a performance that made director Ridley Scott worry that she was “<a href="/film-tv/article/54823/1/lady-gaga-expands-on-the-mental-impact-of-her-house-of-gucci-role-ridley-scott">traumatizing</a>” herself.</p>
<p>“I see a very non-specific actor,” she adds of her <em>Sopranos </em>appearance. “And now I see myself as someone who is at least really striving to be specific without thinking about it, and that requires a lot of work ahead of time.”</p>
<p>In part, she credits this change to Scott, calling the filmmaker: “An incredible director who creates a sanctuary for you on set to just fly.”</p>

<p>Back in 2015, a study by Public Health England was published, showing that one in four Black men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. One in 12, it revealed, will die from prostate cancer, making Black men twice as likely to lose their lives to the disease than white men.</p>
<p>These statistics take centre stage in <a href="/stevemcqueen">Steve McQueen</a>’s new short film, <em>Embarrassed</em>, which (as the title suggests) aims to dispel any awkwardness that might stifle conversation about prostate cancer in the Black community.</p>
<p>Starring four award-winning Black actors — Idris Elba, <a href="/morgan-freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>, Chiwetel Ejiofor, and <a href="/film-tv/article/45966/1/top-boy-oral-history-interview-ashley-walters-kano-little-simz-netflix">Micheal Ward</a> — the vital film runs at just under two minutes, and premiered last week at a star-studded <a href="/tate-britain">Tate Britain</a> screening.</p><p>Directed by the British artist and filmmaker, <em>Embarrassed </em>is created in collaboration with the Male Cancer Awareness Campaign, with support from the British brand Belstaff.</p>
<p>Besides raising awareness about the disease’s disproportionate effect on Black men, the organisers intend to encourage the UK government to introduce automatic testing for the demographic at highest risk: Black men aged 45 and over.</p>
<p>“Prostate cancer is survivable,” as Elba notes in the film. “If caught and treated early enough.”</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">America’s Next Top Model’s most shocking and problematic moments</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">As former contestants speak out about their abusive treatment on the show, we look back at the questionable photoshoots, challenges, and choices made by Tyra Banks and her team</h3>

	</figure>
<p>Mid-00s hit <em>America’s Next Top Model</em> – once quintessential viewing for fashion (and drama)-hungry teenage girls – has faced a reckoning in recent years. Problematic moments that may have slipped by its young viewers have reemerged on social media – and, boy, are some of them bad. From shoots in blackface and injury-inducing runway challenges to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyPvxFmegHM">transphobia</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nZ2R_Bpzhs">body shaming</a>, <em>ANTM</em> hasn’t just aged badly, it’s amazing it aired at all.</p>
<p>In May last year, after old clips resurfaced, the show’s model creator, executive producer, and host Tyra Banks <a href="/fashion/article/49176/1/tyra-banks-responds-to-criticism-americas-next-top-model-racism">responded to criticism</a>. “Been seeing the posts about the insensitivity of some past <em>ANTM</em> moments and I agree with you,” she wrote on Twitter. “Looking back, those were some really off choices. Appreciate your honest feedback, and am sending so much love and virtual hugs.”</p>
<p>Expanding on this in a September 2020 interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqaMXzvyFEamp;t=1s"><em>Chicks in the Office</em></a>, Banks said she addressed and apologised for many of the show’s mistakes when writing her 2018 book, <em>Perfect Is Boring</em>, but would continue to apologise every time offensive archive clips sprung up. Now, however, it looks like she might have some new apologising to contend with, as former contestants are speaking out about the abusive treatment of models behind-the-scenes.</p><p>Earlier this week, it emerged that <em>ANTM</em> stars were paid just $40 (£30) a day, which had to cover all their food expenses, as well as all other living costs. Cycle nine (2007) contestant Sarah Hartshorne – who <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahhartshorne/status/1465542257365430274">confirmed the girls’ pay</a> on Twitter – has also made other shocking revelations on her <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahbhartshorne">TikTok account</a>. In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahbhartshorne/video/7024184180544212230?sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;is_copy_url=0">video</a> about contestants having to sign NDAs, Hartshorne recalls a harrowing moment when “lawyers and producers” in “business attire” warned the models that if they broke their NDA, they would be sued for $10 million. “The executive producer said, ‘We know that (you don’t have $10 million). We won’t just sue you, we’ll sue your whole family. We will keep suing you until we get that money.”</p>
<p>Hartshorne <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahbhartshorne/video/6993376069214539013?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nylon.com%2Flife%2Famericas-next-top-model-40-dollarsamp;referer_video_id=6990070735674854662amp;refer=embedamp;is_copy_url=0amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766">also suggested</a> that producers “fed” the contestants lines, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahbhartshorne/video/6971146257943252230?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nylon.com%2Flife%2Famericas-next-top-model-40-dollarsamp;referer_video_id=6990070735674854662amp;refer=embedamp;is_copy_url=0amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766">encouraged girls to shower together</a> so they could film them (producers allegedly said they couldn’t film contestants alone in the bathroom), and called <em>ANTM</em> a “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sarahbhartshorne/video/6990070735674854662?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nylon.com%2Flife%2Famericas-next-top-model-40-dollarsamp;referer_video_id=6990070735674854662amp;refer=embedamp;is_copy_url=0amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766">traumatic sleepaway camp</a>”.</p>
<p>Cycle five (2005) contestant Lisa D’Amato – who returned for cycle 17’s<em> All Stars</em> in 2011 – has also started spilling the <em>ANTM</em> tea <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lisa_damato">on TikTok</a>. As well as saying she participated in <em>All Stars</em> to “<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lisa_damato/video/7029106973744319750?is_from_webapp=v1amp;is_copy_url=0amp;lang=enamp;sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766">get revenge</a>” for how she was treated on the show, D’Amato <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lisa_damato/video/7023441651318197550?is_from_webapp=v1amp;is_copy_url=0amp;sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766">revealed the story</a> behind the infamous <em>ANTM </em>clip of her <a href="https://youtu.be/z_PuAr5sDRU?t=602">peeing in a diaper</a>, saying she did it to “piss on (co-creator Ken Mock’s) fucking show” after he “(provoked) me and my trauma in all my interviews” and allegedly told lies to the other girls to turn them against D’Amato.</p>
<p>With new allegations about behind-the-scenes treatment of contestants, we thought it was time to look back at on-screen <em>ANTM </em>moments that were both problematic and potentially traumatising for the models.</p><h2><strong>THE ‘RACE SWAP’ CHALLENGE</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uk0VeNWpQ8">‘race swap’ photo shoot</a> from season four (2005) is probably the most famous example of <em>ANTM </em>getting it wrong. In the episode, the show’s creative director Jay Manuel (AKA Mr Jay) revealed that the week’s photo shoot would see the girls switch ethnicities. “The challenge here is taking on the persona of that other ethnicity,” explained Jay. White girls were put in blackface, Black girls were transformed into other women of colour, and one white girl was made… Italian. The producers didn’t learn, however, and, in cycle 13 (2009), they had a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7MH4BA8L9k">‘biracial Hapa’ shoot</a> in Hawaii, where each contestant was made up to represent a specific mixed ethnicity (Hapa is the Hawaiian word for a mixed race person).</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="5Uk0VeNWpQ8"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Uk0VeNWpQ8" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><h2><strong>WILD MAKEOVERS</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="/beauty/head/article/48763/1/americas-next-top-model-weird-makeover-meltdown-tyra-banks-molly-oconnell-denzel">makeover episode</a> was undoubtedly the best of each season, spawning some beautiful transformations, and some straight up disasters. Each cycle, there’s at least one girl who has a meltdown – sometimes unjustly (see: cycle five’s Cassandra quitting the show because she hated her – as Tyra always said – “<em>Rosemary’s Baby</em>” pixie haircut), and sometimes for a very good reason. Poor Molly O’Connell in cycle 16 (2011) was notoriously left with a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mollyaoconnell/video/6938134345450310917?sender_device=pcamp;sender_web_id=7037042434212021766amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;is_copy_url=0">badly-sewn-in bleach blonde</a> weave after Tyra pondered, “What if Diana Ross was a blonde?” It eventually caused her scalp issues and had to be removed. Cycle eight’s (2007) Brittany also had a terrible experience with sewn-in hair. With no tips to maintain the big red curls, Brittany’s hair eventually became known (by Tyra) as “the hamster that died on her head”.</p>
<p>Hair drama aside, the most problematic makeover moment happened in cycle six (2006), when the judges forced eventual winner Danielle to <a href="https://twitter.com/OladapoAisha/status/1257486814090350592">close the gap between her front teeth</a>, even though she didn’t want to. After being sent to the dentist and refusing to have the gap closed, Tyra said: “Do you really think you can have a CoverGirl contract with a gap in your mouth?”, adding that she wouldn’t be “marketable” with it. J Alexander (Mrs Jay) then warned: “I guess she just left the <em>gap</em> wide open for another girl, baby.” She did eventually get her gap partially closed. Addressing gapgate in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_3JE6MnLOS/">May 2020 Instagram video</a>, Danielle said she wasn’t mad about the judges comments, but was annoyed that she was “set up” to make “good TV”, as she was never explicitly told that Tyra wanted her to get her gap closed. Then, to really rub salt in the wound, in season 15 (2010), Tyra actually <a href="https://www.mamamia.com.au/dakota-tooth-gap/"><em>widened</em> the gap</a> in one of the girl’s teeth to make her look “more edgy”.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h2><strong>BERSERK (AND DANGEROUS) RUNWAYS</strong></h2>
<p>So many of the <em>ANTM</em> runways were not only insane, but actually pretty dangerous. They were also stupid – no model in the real world would ever be expected to walk down a two-foot-wide runway <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3FsAJoUP8M">inside a zorb ball</a> over a pool of water. Yes it made for great TV when they fell over and couldn’t get the ball out of the water, but also… how embarrassing! How mean! Another water-based runway saw the cycle seven girls (2006) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va17uUBKxR8">strut down a wobbly catwalk</a> – if you stumble, you’re in the drink (as Eugena tragically found out). While these two examples weren’t so much life-threatening, but rather dumb and unglamorous, some of the runways were more <em>Total Wipeout</em> than <em>America’s Next Top Model</em>. First up, the high-speed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InFEtrTRnyw">conveyor belt runway</a>, which is exactly what you would imagine it to be: impossible, humiliating, and scary. Next, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxzyOcIoJI4">swinging pendulum runway</a>, where models had to walk down the catwalk and avoid two massive swinging pendulums. Alongside some near misses, Alexandra was actually hit by one and knocked clean off the stage – she even bled afterwards (@HR!). </p>
<p>But the award for most treacherous runway goes to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUBt2pJnjRg">high heels challenge</a> during a cycle six judging. The girls had to stomp the makeshift catwalk in “very high” heels – supposedly a la <a href="/tag/vivienne-westwood">Vivienne Westwood</a> – with their ankles literally bending as they walked. As well as being a horrific watch, it resulted in Danielle twisting her ankle, crawling away, and returning to judging with crutches. To stop you wincing at your desk like I just did, I’ve embedded a less bone-breaking runway clip below.</p>
<p>(Bonus cycle six runway: when they had to walk down the catwalk with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AYbf6uJYjU">cockroaches attached to them</a> and Jade kissed hers at the end.)</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="InFEtrTRnyw"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/InFEtrTRnyw" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><h2><strong>EXTREME PHOTO SHOOTS</strong></h2>
<p>The <em>ANTM </em>girls had to face all their fears during their weekly photo shoots. Scared of reptiles? Time to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKs4vM2Zx84">shoot with a snake</a>. Have arachnophobia? Here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7s7Z6-itvU">tarantula as an accessory</a>. If those fears seem irrational, what about a fear of dying from hypothermia? Don’t worry, <em>ANTM</em> can help by giving you exposure therapy. In cycle seven, eventual winner CariDee <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiQLLD_71Wo">ended up convulsing</a> after spending too long shooting in a freezing cold pool. Despite the judges constantly telling the girls they must adapt to any situation and never complain, Tyra and Mr Jay blamed CariDee for not speaking up when she was struggling.</p>
<p>Another extreme shoot moment came in cycle four, when the contestants had to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHIjjGCMjtM">photographed inside an open grave</a>. If this wasn’t already a nightmare scenario, one of the girls, Kahlen, had just found out that her childhood friend had passed away – only to be whisked off to a graveyard for a seven deadly sins shoot the very next day. In a move that made the whole thing seem cruelly planned, Kahlen was given ‘anger’ as her sin, with Mr Jay encouraging her to “turn her nerves into anger”.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="fHIjjGCMjtM"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHIjjGCMjtM" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><h2><strong>NOT RESPECTING THE GIRLS’ BOUNDARIES</strong></h2>
<p>In season one (2003), two models, Shannon and Robin, decided not to participate in a “simulated nude” shoot because they felt uncomfortable posing naked/semi-naked. Instead of respecting their decision and allowing them to do an altered version of the shoot, the pair were sent to judging without photos – and were unfairly criticised by Tyra and the other judges. “If you’re not willing to do that, you might as well go work in a car factory or a bakery because that’s part of being a model,” judge Janice Dickinson <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G4_gsRujEvs">told Shannon</a>. Seemingly in an attempt to trip her up or embarrass her, Tyra then brought up an earlier shoot from the season. “What do you think,” says Tyra, “do you feel more comfortable biting a man’s ear or doing a photoshoot and simulating nudity?” In the same episode, Robin – who also didn’t have a photo – was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1SfQ1bPjRw">called out</a> for saying no to the shoot, but shaking her breasts in front of Mr Jay on set (Janice even asked her where her Bible was when she was nude off-camera). What the judges appear to have forgotten is that being naked IRL and being documented naked are two very different things. In cycle seven, Ginger also didn’t want to pose nude, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npKDtXIMkpc">reluctantly did it</a> in a clip that makes for very uncomfortable viewing – only for Mr Jay to describe her as “unwilling to cooperate” because she only did two frames.</p>
<p>In cycle 15, Kayla was pressured into filming a close contact commercial with a male model, despite opening up to Mr Jay, telling him she didn’t want to do it because it was traumatising to her as a sexual assault survivor. Ultimately, she was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xsOIWPKGWI">forced to do it anyway</a> – and, although she didn’t lock lips with the model, he did kiss her on the neck, which isn’t really any better. Speaking of being forced to kiss someone in a commercial (how has this happened more than once?) season seven’s Jaeda – a woman of colour – had to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-NdtcmxFkU">make out with a racist male model</a>, who’d previously told her he didn’t like Black girls. A similarly sad moment happens in season four, when Keenyah <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxeU1Iri-bU">feels uncomfortable during a shoot</a> because a male model keeps grinding too close to her and moaning in her ear. Despite asking for space, the photographer encourages the male models to get closer to Keenyah. “I know it’s not about feeling comfortable,” she tells Mr Jay, “but I can hear him moaning and it threw me off. I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” She cried when she came off set, telling the camera: “There was a line that I feel was crossed.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="HxeU1Iri-bU"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HxeU1Iri-bU" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><h2><strong>AND, OF COURSE, YELLING AT THEM</strong></h2>

<p>When Kevin McCallister gets the whole house to himself in <em>Home Alone</em>, he’s thrilled (that is, until the Wet Bandits show up...) Now you can experience Kevin’s joy IRL with a stay at the genuine McCallister family home in Chicago, which is being listed for rent on Airbnb this Christmas.</p>
<p>The perfect place to eat junk food, watch rubbish all night long, and daub yourself in Peter McCallister’s aftershave à la Kevin, it’s now bookable for four guests at the very reasonable price of $25.</p>
<p>According to the listing, renters can expect a candlelit dinner of Kraft macaroni amp; cheese and Chicago’s finest pizza, booby traps, a “meet and greet” with a real-life tarantula, and “ample opportunity to scream into the mirror”. If you’ve ever wanted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNWO9lfBg-s">chicken suit</a> someone, now’s your chance.</p><p>Kev’s big brother Buzz is playing Airbnb host (and helpfully sanitising all surfaces in line with the rental company’s protocol) – just stay out of his room, okay?</p>
<p>The Illinois stay opportunity (which is for one night only, on December 12) arrives in line with new film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BkVf2voCr0"><em>Home Sweet Home Alone</em></a>, which guests will enjoy a screening of during their stay.</p>
<p>You can request to book the house from December 7 <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/rooms/53274539?source_impression_id=p3_1638444199_htf2DQCTw3gUA0n2">here</a>.

<h2><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</strong></h2>
<p>With its XXX fashion label, <a href="/tag/ermenegildo-zegna">Ermenegildo Zegna</a> brought comfort to couture, merging the soft jersey of streetwear with the sharp tailoring of a lavish tuxedo. Now, with its namesake fragrance collection, the luxury Italian house is breaking the mould once again. The new series – pronounced ‘Triple Stitch’ – is a bold trifecta of scents that pay homage to the beauty of non-conformity.</p>
<p>XXX’s three Eau de Parfums – each infused with the crisp aroma of a different metal – all transported me into various cinematic scenes. XXX Verdigris – a warm, fresh fragrance with notes of cardamom, violet, and titanium, which has an almost grassy scent that gives way to gentle florals as it absorbs into the skin – is giving me Tarkovsky’s <em>Mirror </em>(think: a peaceful expanse of grassy land). The fiery XXX Cyprium is a copper storm, with fragrant tones of cedarwood that delicately intensify over time – hello, <em>Dune</em>. The third and final scent, XXX Charcoal, is a sensual, smoky fragrance that explodes with black pepper, limbanol, elemi, and the essence of graphite, and has a dry, earthy base that offers a rich and lasting flavour. With this, I’m a lone cowboy in no particular western film, wandering the vast, sandy desert searching for love. (Terms and conditions: cinematic experience not guaranteed).</p>
<p>Besides, before you even lift the lid on the XXX fragrance, you’ll be sold by the bottle. Nourishing its fashion savvy fans, Ermenegildo Zenga’s rich (fully recyclable) metallic bottles each compliment their natural aromatics, in shimmering green, copper, and – you guessed it – charcoal. Plus, they look like they’re melting, which makes for a very chic mantelpiece addition.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of the fragrance range – which celebrates self-expression and freedom – Ermenegildo Zenga gathered three creative rulebreakers, <a href="/fashion/article/54461/1/zegna-taps-gabriel-kane-day-lewis-for-its-xxx-fragrance-launch">G-K Day-Lewis</a>, <a href="/fashion/article/54464/1/jordun-love-zegna-xxx-missy-elliot-fashion-week-beyonce-dance">Jordun Love</a>, and <a href="/fashion/article/54465/1/demitre-sullivan-zegna-fragrance-xxx-dancer-pianist-mtv-black-ballet">Demitre Sullivan</a>, to <a href="/fashion/article/54429/1/zegna-unrestricted">put their spin on the scents</a>. “Your scent is part of your identity that people can recognise with their eyes closed,” said Love. “Being a part of the XXX campaign has shown me how you can command a room with your scent.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Leading up to his latest exhibition, artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanone/">Tan Gillies</a> moved back to his childhood home and spent three solitary months alone in his former bedroom – a site of trauma where, many years ago, he’d witnessed the domestic violence that would come to inform so much of his work. There, he immersed himself into a monastic routine of sleeping, eating, and painting while confronting the layers of meaning and deconstructing the shadowy density of painful recollections the house held for him. “It was good to just make a mess and also be alone in that house that I haven’t really lived in for nearly 20 years, and just try and process some of the memories that I’ve spent most of my life trying to escape,” he told Dazed. “It helped me make some peace with myself and I’m very grateful for that.”</p><p><em>Nights of Violence</em> at London’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sohorevue/">Soho Revue</a> distils Gillies’ experiences of this dark but creative interlude in the hinterland between adult life and childhood memory. Using text, film, photography, painting, and sculpture, he moves between the three psychogeographies of suburbia, inner-city London, and his motherland, Iceland – distinct, formative landscapes which function for Gillies as repositories of cumulative memory and experience. </p>
<p>These visceral artworks by one of the most exciting emerging artists working in London today challenge us to grapple with questions about violence, addiction, life, death, and grief, while alluding to the possibility of safety, acceptance, and peace that could exist on the other side of trauma. Above, take a look through some installation shots from <em>Nights of Violence</em>. Below, we talk with Tan Gillies about the experience of returning to his childhood home, making sense of grief, and the subversive and brutal undercurrent of life in the suburbs.</p>	<figure>

<p><strong>For anyone encountering your work for the first time, please could you tell us about </strong><strong><em>Nights of Violence</em></strong><strong> and talk us through the sensory experience of the exhibition? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>This is my first solo show and I guess it’s just a part of my evolution as a visual artist and communicator. It leads on from my book <a href="/life-culture/article/53340/1/tan-gillies-book-is-an-unflinching-look-at-addiction-trauma-and-healing"><em>Cold Bones</em></a> and the short film <em>Trauma Hurts</em> I released earlier this year. </p>
<p>For the last 18 months, I’ve dedicated every waking minute to creating stuff that’s been clogged in my head. Some days it’s painting, some days it’s photography, some days it’s… I have no idea, but I know I have to do it in order to stay on an even-keel, mentally.</p>
<p>The title comes from spending the last three months making the final bits of the show completely alone in the house I grew up in as a kid and, yeah, there was some mad shit going on there in those days. But this time it was just really peaceful and I had a lot of time to think and process some of those darker memories and push them into the work in a positive way. </p>
<p>In terms of sensory experience, it’s kind of immersive and feeling-based. I want people to take whatever they want from it. There is not one linear message being communicated or some political statement, it’s just a visual download of feelings. It’s kind of like a drug experience.</p>
<p>I think people are going to be surprised to see some of the stuff in there, like the sculpture piece. I’ve kept it all really low key so far and not showed any work online or anything except for a couple of older pieces that will be in there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The title comes from spending the last three months making the final bits of the show completely alone in the house I grew up in as a kid... I had a lot of time to think and process some of those darker memories and push them into the work in a positive way” – Tan Gillies</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What mediums are you working with for this new show? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>Mainly painting… using acrylics, gloss house paint on raw unprimed canvas, enamel on glass, and other stuff found in the woods. You can watch my film also and then there are photographs I’ve never shown before, and some stuff on paper. The sculpture is made from a goat skull from Iceland, sitting in a glass coffin full of ketamine. </p>
<p><strong>What would you say are the recurring themes of your work? And how do they make themselves apparent in this latest exhibition? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>I think that whatever I make or have made recently tends to deal with the light and the dark of life, and that can be applied to different things. I’m always trying to process my emotions in one way or another and that can feel good but it can also feel really bad. I don’t want to talk too much about it as I’ve said it a lot before, but I’m a product of domestic violence and generational alcoholism and addiction. I’m affected by that and I always will be so, of course, a lot of that stuff pops up in my work. But, moving on, I’ll move past that and make work about other stuff I’m sure. </p>
<p>I struggle a lot with the concept of being alive one day and then gone the next, and the purpose of all this shit that’s going on around me. I try and make sense of the stuff I’ve experienced while under the influence of certain substances in the past. My mind has been places my body hasn’t and I believe in something bigger going on. Call it the universe or whatever you like, but I’m always trying to tap further into that. These days, without using drugs. And making these things helps that. I think visually in this body of work you can see and feel the light and the dark, the happiness and the sadness, you know the full spectrum of feelings that we as humans are blessed and cursed with.  </p>	<figure>

<p><strong>How would you characterise the three distinct psychogeographies of suburbia, inner-city London, and Iceland? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>All three of those places make up who I am as a person – I’m a mixture of all that stuff, and that’s what makes me have to make art. </p>
<p>Suburbia and the London outskirts are the fucking maddest places – well, in my experience, anyway. Most people I’m sure think of middle-class, sleepy, little areas I guess. And that’s true to a certain extent, but I think of serial killers, teenage drinkers in the park, young romance, smoking bongs, doing acid, popping pills, traveller sites, old soiled mattresses, discarded condoms in the woods, pub fights, and some fucking really loony shit going on. Two of the schools I went to – my first school and my secondary – young schoolgirls were kidnapped and murdered by different serial killers from both those schools at different times. That’s fucked. And just a million other strange and peculiar goings-on I experienced as a youth growing up. And that’s not me saying it is a totally negative place, it’s just a very interesting place. </p>
<p>There’s just a completely different energy to the inner city and, with that, a whole array of characters and inspirations. I soaked a lot of that stuff in growing up and I’m a product of it as well. I spent over half my life living in zones one and two of London. London as a city is just the best, anything you want to experience – good and bad – is right there… the most amazing spectrum of insanity in full sensory glory. My early memories of going to gigs at the Astoria and skating at Southbank at, like, 11 or 12 years old and just being totally blown away, obsessed, and slightly terrified at the chaos of the place. I threw myself in headfirst. </p>
<p>London’s changed a lot over the years but it’s still one of – if not <em>the</em> greatest – cities in the world. From music, art, fashion, skating, and deeper hedonism it’s just an explosion of creativity, culture, and madness and it’s totally unique. I love it and it inspires everything I make. </p>
<p>Iceland is everything else to me. It’s my mother’s homeland, where my grandparents are buried, and where I’ve found my peace over the years. It’s a very, very special place to me and, again, has informed who I am as a person and as an artist. It’s full of amazing characters, folklore, and magic and an incredible place to get lost. The landscapes and sky are just mind-blowing all year round for various reasons and it is full of energy and power – literally, as you will have seen recently with the latest volcanic eruption. That country really puts us as humans into perspective compared to the forces of mother nature. It’s impossible not to be totally blown away by that when you are there, it really puts all this social media narcissistic bullshit that has engulfed humanity into perspective, people wasting their life posting 1,000 pictures or videos of their own heavily-filtered face day after day after day instead of trying to stand for something or leave some kind of contribution behind, you know? Some of the work in this show I came up with when I was in Iceland trying to get my shit together last year, and it informs every single piece in one way or another. For example, the three large paintings ‘Until The Light Takes Us’ are, essentially, psychedelic saturated landscapes of cemeteries in Iceland during December. </p>

<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>Yeah, it’s not been a straightforward journey, I guess. From day to day it changes, my ideas develop, and I think I’m going to make this or that, it’s going to look like this or that, and it just ends up being something totally different. But I like that. </p>
<p>I had two studios in Acton in West London for a year and made some of the initial stuff whilst in those with a rough idea to do a show at some point. And, like I said, most of the stuff from that first 12 months never even saw the light of day. I ended up taking random things that I liked and that made sense to me and putting those in the show. Then, for the last three months prior to its opening I intentionally moved out of my flat and studio and moved into the back room of my childhood home. I set up a studio there.</p>
<p>My mum is very cool and encouraged me to let loose and do with it as I wanted, and so I just slept, ate, and painted in there for three months completely alone. </p>
<p>I’d never stretched canvases before so I taught myself how to do that and just fully immersed myself in it. It took a lot of mistakes and a lot of experimentation to get to a place where I had the works that I’ve brought into the show from that period. </p>
<p>I was using all kinds of different methods there and it was good to just make a mess and also be alone in that house that I haven’t really lived in for nearly 20 years, and just try and process some of the memories that I’ve spent most of my life trying to escape. It helped me make some peace with myself and I’m very grateful for that. In amongst that, I was fucking around with sculptures and stuff, and one of them made it into the show. As you will see, it’s heavily inspired by all the stuff here above. </p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Could you tell us about the topic of violence and how your new show explores and comments on this phenomenon? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>Violence was a big part of my life, not just ’cause my father was a very violent man when I was a kid but, I guess, also just in my life growing up. Nights out could get very violent – whether at the pub, after school, out skating, beef, or just mates fighting each other. I really don’t condone it or wish to ever have to be a part of it ever again. </p>
<p>I have very clear and powerful memories of my mum – the person I love most in this world – with her face covered in blood, and her face bashed in. You know, that shit never ever leaves you. So I was born into violence, it made me feel terribly unsafe, and I was heavily affected. That left me needing to attach myself to self-destructive coping mechanisms as I grew into a man myself – whether that be drugs, graffiti, crime, or fighting. So, really, all of that stuff is in this work. It’s me working through a lot of traumatic experiences – some that were totally out of my control and some that I put myself in or even orchestrated. This is how I channel all of that stuff now, it all goes in one direction and that is creating the things that I see in my head, firstly for myself and maybe for other people too. </p>
<p><strong>What would you most like visitors to take away from </strong><strong><em>Nights of Violence</em></strong><strong>? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Tan Gillies: </strong>People can take whatever they want from it, I didn’t make it for anyone in particular. I make things for myself first and foremost but, of course, if people connect and relate, that’s lovely. </p>
<p>In general though, I’d like people to stop, think, and talk more, maybe think about the friend who doesn’t seem quite right and is withdrawn and might have problems at home. Are they okay? Do they need help? You know, I just want abusers to be publicly shamed as much as possible. And, more than that, removed from society completely. There is no place in this world for bullies and violent cowards. I don’t stand for it and if you know of abuse going on in a home or relationship and don’t tell anyone then you are complicit.</p>
<p>The knock-on effect of that shit ruins many lives. Don’t be ashamed to talk about things in general… addiction, domestic violence, mental health, whatever. Don’t let this shit eat you alive. In general, talking saves lives and that’s a fact. Be kind to yourself and those around you. Also, I want people to see that you can kind of do anything you like with your life, it’s never too late. I switched my shit up completely and just went the other way and I’m much much happier for it. </p>

<p>We’ve seen <a href="/art-photography/article/54908/1/damien-hirst-turned-drake-certified-lover-boy-cover-art-nfts-great-expectations">Drake cover art</a>, <a href="/beauty/body/article/52765/1/cara-delevingne-is-selling-an-nft-of-her-vagina">replicas</a> of <a href="/tag/cara-delevingne">Cara Delevigne</a>’s vagina, <a href="/film-tv/article/54597/1/david-lynch-releasing-short-film-nft-collection-red-button-man-interpol-lights">David Lynch films</a>, and even the code for the <a href="/science-tech/article/53227/1/you-can-now-buy-the-original-world-wide-web-as-an-nft">original World Wide Web</a> sold as non-fungible tokens. Next joining the <a href="/tag/nft">NFT</a>-sphere is <a href="/tag/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>’ viral, patchwork cardigan.</p>
<p>Last February, the musician and Dazed <a href="/music/article/54765/1/harry-styles-pleasing-brand-cover-2021-interview">cover star</a> was spotted wearing the chunky-knit cardigan during a rehearsal for <em>The Today Show </em>in New York. Shortly after, TikTok feeds flooded with users attempting to make <a href="/fashion/article/49694/1/harry-styles-crochet-patchwork-cardigan-tiktok-trend-jw-anderson-diy-fashion">their own versions</a> of the design, labelled as the #HarryStylesCardigan.</p>
<p>Adding to the challenge, luxury label <a href="/tag/jw-anderson">J.W. Anderson</a> – who originally designed the piece for its <a href="/tag/ss20">SS20</a> menswear collection – stepped in, releasing an official pattern and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-igQBecLdKIamp;ab_channel=JWAnderson">YouTube tutorial</a> for free for those recreating Styles’ knitted look. Later, due to its extreme popularity, the <a href="/tag/victoria-and-albert">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> added the item to its <a href="/fashion/article/51121/1/harry-styles-tiktok-famous-jw-anderson-cardigan-finds-a-home-in-the-va-museum">permanent collection</a> – displaying the piece to signify the DIY creativity sparked by <a href="/tag/coronavirus">COVID</a> lockdowns, and a move towards eco-friendly fashion practices.</p><p>Taking its next steps, a hyper-realistic digital copy of the cardigan is being auctioned off as the first-ever archive sale from fashion-focused NFT platform <a href="https://www.xydrobe.com/">Xydrobe</a>. According to <a href="https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/jw-anderson-to-auction-harrystylescardigan-nft-in-partnership-with-xydrobe/2021113059707"><em>Fashion United</em></a>, Xydrobe’s visual effect artists spent 300 hours creating the virtual cardigan – developing each piece of yarn in 3D, before weaving it together in the six original knit patterns.</p>
<p>The founder and creative director of J.W. Anderson, Jonathan Anderson, explained his choice to sell the product as an NFT in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW8N6UlgiWn/">interview</a> on Xydrobe. “I think we have had a lot of iconic pieces in the relatively short history of J.W. Anderson, but the cardigan in particular became iconic because of social media,” he said. “It just felt right that this jumper that exploded online should also be recreated as an NFT.”</p>
<p>Bidding for the digital cardigan will begin on December 12 at £10,000 – all proceeds from the sale will be donated to the charity, <a href="https://www.akt.org.uk/">Akt</a>, which helps to serve <a href="/tag/lgbt">LGBTQ+</a> youth living in homelessness or hostile environments.</p>

<p>Since the <a href="/fashion/article/54914/1/virgil-abloh-has-passed-away-died-louis-vuitton-off-white">announcement</a> of the sudden and devastating loss of<a href="/tag/virgil-abloh"> Virgil Abloh</a> this past Sunday (November 28), the fashion industry and wider cultural world have been in mourning. From Kanye West to Frank Ocean, countless friends, colleagues, and fans have been <a href="/fashion/article/54920/1/frank-ocean-kanye-west-louis-vuitton-lead-tributes-to-virgil-abloh">paying tribute</a> to the boundary-breaking, game-changing designer. Others have been on the hunt for his signature designs. </p>
<p>Resale platforms have reported that demand for <a href="/off-white">Off-White</a> and <a href="/louis-vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>, where Abloh served as men’s artistic director, have soared since the news broke, with a huge surge in both prices and sales. As <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/soaring-resale-demand-for-off-white-product-puts-platforms-in-a-bind/">reported</a> by <em>Business of Fashion</em>, The RealReal saw sales of Off-White increase 18 times from Saturday to Sunday, while searches increased 893 percent. Searches for “Virgil Louis Vuitton” were up 344 percent.</p>
<p>Sneaker resale marketplace StockX, meanwhile, reported that “Off-White” was the most searched term on Sunday and said both prices and sales of Abloh’s collaboration with Nike and Jordan spiked. The average resale price of the Off-White Jordan 1 Chicago rose to over $7,000 (£5,260) and on Monday a pair sold for $11,607 (£8,722).</p><p>This increase in prices has led to criticism over the last few days of resale platforms for not pausing the sale of Off-White products, with many social media users <a href="https://twitter.com/aaconceptt/status/1465032402003181570?s=20">accusing them</a> of benefitting from a tragedy. “StockX and all the other resell websites should take down any products associated with Virgil Abloh. There will be plenty trying to profit off his passing,” <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyotrav/status/1465045456443121670?s=20">wrote</a> one person on Twitter.</p>
<p>While StockX has continued to sell his designs, it <a href="https://twitter.com/stockx/status/1465090724475682816?s=20">announced</a> on Sunday it will be making an unspecified donation to the <a href="https://www.fashionscholarshipfund.org/virgil-abloh">Virgil Abloh Scholarship Fund</a>. The platform made a similar donation following the death of NBA superstar <a href="/life-culture/article/47652/1/the-world-pays-tribute-to-kobe-bryant-and-daughter-gianna">Kobe Bryant</a> in January 2020. After searches and prices for Bryant merchandise on the site soared, StockX said it would <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/kobe-bryant-death-mamba-sneakers-nike-adidas-stockx/">donate all proceeds</a> of Bryant merchandise made the week of the athlete's death to the Kobe and Vanessa Bryant Family Foundation.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Louis Vuitton paid tribute to Abloh as his <a href="/fashion/article/54942/1/louis-vuitton-pays-tribute-virgil-abloh-was-here-final-show-ss22-miami">final collection was showcased</a> in Miami, in accordance with<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW2A_pbARzD/"> his wishes</a>. Subtitled “Virgil Was Here”, the<a href="/ss22"> SS22</a> presentation acted as a send-off for the boundary-breaking designer, but also a testament to his outlook on work and creativity.</p>
<p>The show ended with fireworks in honour of Abloh, lighting up the sky as his voice reverberated through the darkness with one final statement: “There’s no limit. Life is so short that you can’t waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do, versus knowing what you can do.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="8z9jJh1yHAg"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8z9jJh1yHAg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54956</id><title type="text">Machine Gun Kelly launches a nail polish brand for introverts</title><summary type="html">The musician says the brand, titled UN/DN LAQR, is ‘the Willy Wonka of what beauty is to become’</summary><published>2021-12-02T12:03:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-02T12:03:00Z</updated><author><name>Hannah Bertolino</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/beauty/body/article/54956/1/machine-gun-kelly-launches-a-nail-polish-brand-for-introverts?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=machine-gun-kelly-launches-a-nail-polish-brand-for-introverts" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[

	</figure>
<p>After years of flaunting intricate nail looks on the red carpet (see his iHeartRadio Music Awards <a href="https://twitter.com/bestgug/status/1398317104944664576?s=20">acrylics</a> from last May for evidence), <a href="https://www.instagram.com/machinegunkelly/?hl=en">Machine Gun Kelly</a> has officially launched his own nail polish brand.</p>
<p>The beauty line, titled <a href="https://undnlaqr.com/">UN/DN LAQR</a>, features ten classic shades of nail polish – chosen so that the colours can be worn regardless of the season. The range includes a black hue called ‘Depressionist’, paying homage to when MGK would colour his nails with Sharpies during middle school; a red-orange shade, ‘25 to Life’, named by <a href="/fashion/article/54265/1/goth-girlfriends-megan-fox-and-kourtney-kardashian-land-a-skims-campaign">goth girlfriend</a> <a href="/tag/megan-fox">Megan Fox</a>; and a dark green shade, ‘Mary Jane’, because MGK “<a href="https://www.thecut.com/2021/10/mgk-megan-fox-i-am-weed.html">is weed</a>”, we guess.</p>
<p>Each polish in the collection is crafted with a thick brush, so that the collection is accessible to all people, of all beauty capabilities. “I’m not expecting people to be nail artists, right? I want it to be accessible,” the musician told <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/machine-gun-kelly-nail-polish-line-exclusive-interview"><em>Allure</em></a>, explaining that he wants the brand to be for everyone, regardless of how they identify. “I mean, I’m hoping aliens, at some point when they reveal themselves, are fully immersed in the UN/DN stuff.” </p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p>Kelly also explained that the polish might help fans gain confidence in day-to-day life. “A lot of my music was for the introverts, for the people scared to be vulnerable. I know that a lot of people don’t have the external courage to start conversations with people. I’m like that — I’m super shy when it comes to starting conversations,” he said. “When I went and got coffee, one of the first times when I actually had my nails done, I went to the counter and the guy was like, ‘Wow, your nails are so beautiful.’ It makes you want to be open to the conversation.”</p>
<p>He added: “You spend time taking care of yourself and paying attention to a detail and then somebody else appreciates that detail. (It’s) for sure a social connection."</p>
<p>As for the brand’s future, Kelly stated that UN/DR LAQR will be the “Willy Wonka of what beauty is to become,” hinting at a new shade range in 2022 and hopes to create a luxurious, Disneyland-type brand experience. “I’m not the most well-versed CEO, but you know, you’re not listening to me while you’re doing your nails,” he says. “I don’t come with the nail kit.”</p>

<p>As temperatures drop and days become shorter, as the leaves on the trees turn golden and fall to the ground, as frost sparkles and the wind whistles, hot girl summer transitions into cold ass winter. Quite literally, if <a href="/tag/rihanna">Rihanna</a> has it her way.  </p>
<p>The newly crowned <a href="/life-culture/article/54924/1/rihanna-crowned-national-hero-of-barbados-after-republic-ousts-queen">national hero of Barbados</a> has sparked some questions after releasing a pair of assless plaid pajamas as part of a new festive <a href="/tag/savage-x-fenty">Savage x Fenty</a> drop. The seasonably cosy-in-the-front, risqué-in-the-back style comes in two colours, pink plaid and blue plaid, both equally assless. Practical? Probably not. Sexy? Only you can answer that for yourself. </p>
<p>“A spin on classic holiday pyjamas,” reads the Fenty website <a href="https://www.savagex.com/shop/tied-up-tartan-open-back-pj-pant-sq2149253-10304-12454507">description</a>, featuring “an open bum to show off what you want, Savage style”. The pants will set you back $49.95 (£34.54) or $19.98 (£15.01) if you are a VIP member.</p><p>Rihanna debuted the pajamas on her Instagram stories, modelling them herself soundtracked to Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak’s “Smokin Out The Window”. While Rihanna undoubtedly looked incredible in the ensemble, it does also call to mind this <a href="https://i.redd.it/fa2ursnt9fw41.jpg">classic meme</a> and responses from followers were generally mixed. “I’m not rocking with this new fenty lingerie release, there is NOTHING sexy about a butt crack miss plumber girl,” as one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/_47val/status/1465060355860795403?s=20">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>In other Rihanna news, she recently announced a <a href="/music/article/54714/1/rihanna-kind-of-returns-to-music-vinyl-reissue-merch">return to music</a> – kind of. The (former?) singer is republishing her old music, re-releasing her eight studio albums on limited edition vinyl as part of the <a href="https://shoprihanna.com/collections/rih-issue">‘Rih-issue’ series</a>.</p>
<p>Each LP will be paired with a matching piece of merch, ranging from bright tie dye tees corresponding with her earlier albums to custom comic-strip-print hoodies for 2009’s <em>Rated R</em>, and a few nostalgic album art tees.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">Lesbian Christmas rom-com Happiest Season is getting a sequel</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">It’s a Christmas miracle! </h3>

Happiest Season (2020)					</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p>December has finally arrived, which can only mean one thing: a sequel to gay Christmas rom-com <a href="/film-tv/article/51044/1/trailer-for-kristen-stewarts-queer-christmas-rom-com-happiest-season"><em>Happiest Season</em></a> is on its way. Or, at least, that’s what Aubrey Plaza has been hinting at on <a href="/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a>.</p>
<p>The star plays Riley, a doctor and former girlfriend of Harper – played by <a href="/black-mirror" data-stringify-link="https://www.dazeddigital.com/black-mirror" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">Black Mirror</a>’s “<a href="/music/article/33540/1/listen-to-the-music-behind-black-mirrors-san-junipero" data-stringify-link="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/33540/1/listen-to-the-music-behind-black-mirrors-san-junipero" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">San Junipero</a>” lead Mackenzie Davis – in the hit flick, which also stars <a href="/kristen-stewart" data-stringify-link="https://www.dazeddigital.com/kristen-stewart" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-remove-tab-index="true">Kristen Stewart</a>.</p>
<p>In a TikTok video shared by a fan, Plaza is captured at a book signing for her new children’s book<i data-stringify-type="italic"> The Legend of the Christmas Witch, alongside a caption that reads: “Aubrey talking about <i data-stringify-type="italic">Happiest Season OMFGGG.”</i></i></p><p>“There’s gonna be another one,” she says in the clip. “Um, yeah! Because my character deserves love too.”</p>
<p>Riley remains single in the original film, despite fans gunning for her to end up with Stewart’s character Abby. Both characters are kept in the closet by Harper, and have undeniable on-screen tension, so it would only make sense that they rekindle the chemistry for part two.</p>
<p>While nothing has been confirmed, we can only hope that Plaza is speaking truth. Here’s hoping for a Christmas miracle!</p>

<p>The Russian protest group <a href="/pussy-riot">Pussy Riot</a> is set to auction the blood of one of its founding members, the conceptual artist and activist <a href="/user/nadyatolokno">Nadya Tolokonnikova</a>, alongside the freedom certificate that was issued on her release from prison in 2013.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Drink My Blood</em>, the one-off artwork consists of three parts: the freedom certificate stained with the artist’s own blood, a bottle of the aforementioned blood, and a digitized version of the certificate that is soundtracked by an unreleased Pussy Riot song, titled “Anthem”. </p>
<p>The latter follows several other <a href="/nft">NFT</a> releases by Pussy Riot, which have taken on everything from <a href="/art-photography/article/54720/1/a-new-report-highlights-the-nft-market-troubling-gender-gap-beeple-grimes">sexist power structures</a> to their <a href="/politics/article/53742/1/pussy-riot-members-leave-russia-to-escape-continuous-arrests-crackdown">frequent incarcerations</a>. More directly, <em>Drink My Blood </em>is a follow-up to Tolokonnikova’s <a href="https://superrare.com/artwork-v2/virgin-mary,-please-become-a-feminist-28956"><em>Virgin Mary, Please Become A Feminist</em></a>, an artwork created using her prison sentencing documents and sold for 40 ETH (which curently equates to more than £137,000) on SuperRare in September.</p><p>“I spilled some blood on the freedom certificate I was given upon release on xmas eve of 2013, after spending 2 years behind bars,” says Tolokonnikova in a statement on <em>Drink My Blood</em>. “I was injured multiple times as the result of being conditioned to slave labor while serving my time in a camp — I was forced to sew police uniforms.” </p>
<p>“I wanted to make this freedom certificate to reflect the pain every prisoner goes through. The collector quite literally will be sent a physical bottle of my blood, and an NFT.”</p>
<p>A digital version of the artist’s blood vial will also be issued an an NFT to every bidder on the auction, while the winner will receive the physical bottle and digitized certificate. The physical certificate, though technically part of the artwork, will stay with the artist for legal reasons.</p>
<p>The 24-hour <em>Drink My Blood </em>auction begins December 2, at 7pm EST, via the crypto organisation <a href="https://twitter.com/FWBtweets">Friends With Benefits</a> (FWB).</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p><a href="/ridley-scott">Ridley Scott</a>’s <a href="/film-tv/article/53694/1/see-lady-gaga-adam-driver-jared-leto-al-pacino-new-posters-for-house-of-gucci"><em>House of Gucci </em></a>and <a href="/denis-villeneuve">Denis Villeneuve</a>’s epic take on <a href="/dune"><em>Dune</em></a> are, in case you hadn’t noticed, two of the biggest film releases of the year, with both generating a fair amount of award show speculation. However, <a href="/oscars">Oscars</a> buzz — and the directors’ <a href="/film-tv/article/54193/1/dune-director-denis-villeneuve-calls-out-cut-and-paste-marvel-movies">shared dislike</a> for Marvel films — aren’t all that links the two movies, since Scott was once also attached to an 80s adaptation of <em>Dune</em>, only to drop out mid-production.</p>
<p>“It’s always been filmable,” the filmmaker suggests in a new <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ridley-scott-interview-house-of-gucci-dune/">interview</a> with <em>Total Film</em>, despite the many <a href="/film-tv/article/49037/1/all-the-disastrous-attempts-dune-film-david-lynch-denis-villeneuve">disastrous attempts</a> over the years, by filmmakers such as <a href="/alejandro-jodorowsky">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a> and, most famously, <a href="/david-lynch">David Lynch</a>. </p>
<p>“I had a writer called Rudy Wurlitzer, of the Wurlitzer family,” he goes on. “We did a very good take on Dune, because early days, I’d work very, very closely with the writer. I was always glomming the look of the film onto what he or she was writing.”</p>
<p>Scott and Wurlitzer developed the script following the former’s success with <em>Alien</em>, and prior to the release of 1982’s <a href="/blade-runner"><em>Blade Runner</em></a>. Scott had been approached to adapt <em>Dune </em>by Dino De Laurentiis (the producer who brought Lynch into the mix after Scott dropped out). “Dino had got me into it and we said, ‘We did a script, and the script is pretty fucking good,’” Scott says.</p>
<p>He eventually dropped out, however, due to Dino’s insistence that shooting took place in Mexico to keep costs down. “Dino said, ‘It’s expensive, we’re going to have to make it in Mexico,’” Scott recalls. “I said, ‘What!’ He said, ‘Mexico.’ I said, ‘Really?’ So he sent me to Mexico City. And with the greatest respect to Mexico City, in those days (it was) pretty pongy. I didn’t love it.”</p><p>“I went to the studio in Mexico City where the floors were earth floors in the studio. I said, ‘Nah, Dino, I don’t want to make this a hardship.’ And so I actually backed out.”</p>
<p>Of course, David Lynch didn’t have a much easier time working on <em>Dune</em>. “It was a failure and I didn’t have a final cut,” the <em>Eraserhead </em>director said, <a href="/film-tv/article/48954/1/david-lynch-has-zero-interest-in-the-new-dune-film-denis-villeneuve">looking back on the film</a> last year. “It’s not the film I wanted to make. I like certain parts of it very much – but it was a total failure for me.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the new interview with <em>Total Film</em>, Ridley Scott also discusses the reception of <em>House of Gucci</em>, most notably touching on the “insulting” response of the real Gucci family. “I tried to be as respectful as possible by being as factual as possible, and as factual as we can possibly imagine,” he says of the recently-released film. “But the people that were writing from the family to us at the onset were alarmingly insulting, saying that Al Pacino did not represent physically Aldo Gucci in any shape or form.” </p>
<p>“And yet, frankly, how could they be better represented than by Al Pacino? Excuse me! You probably have the best actors in the world, you should be so fucking lucky.”</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">This album is made from the sound waves of people’s orgasms</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">*something about sax and a tromboner*</h3>

	</figure>
<p>Have you ever wondered what your orgasm would sound like if it wasn’t just, err, a big old moan? Me neither! But now you can find out anyway, thanks to a new album based on the sound waves of real people climaxing.</p>
<p>The album, titled <em>Extended Pleasure</em>, has been created by sex toy brand <a href="https://www.lelo.com/">LELO</a> in collaboration with composer and producer Matt Emery. The five-track record features orgasm “donations” by individuals, straight and LGBTQ+ partners, the elderly, and more. </p>
<p>To make the album, Emery transformed the raw orgasm recordings into sound waves, before composing music to match their ebbs and flows. “When emulating the orgasms and turning them into musical pieces, I composed the music writing to the actual orgasm sounds to capture the energy, tempo, and feel of each individual experience, which also helped decide which genre should be paired with each orgasm” explained Emery.</p>
<p> Each track has a different genre based on the vibe of its donated orgasm – from, as the press release said, “climaxing classical to explosive arena rock”. Emery continued: “Instruments also played a big part in this, as I chose instruments not just for the melody or rhythm aspects but also to match certain characteristics of each orgasm too, be that the more intimate breaths captured when recording the saxophone, the inner mechanics of the piano, or the explosiveness of switching between clean and distorted guitars.</p><p>Track one is a jazz tune that uses distant saxophones to create “a bubbly feel which highlights the couple’s moments of joy and laughter as they pause and take a breath”, and a “twinkly piano” for when they climax. Song four is a post rock number, during which “intimate deep breathing and small groans make up the dreamy synth sounds” – it increases with intensity as it goes on before “suddenly (exploding) into a cinematic culmination of heavy guitars and strong drum beats”. Fear not fans of modern classical, lo-fi hip-hop, or 70s dance, there’s also something for you.</p>
<p>“Music is such a powerful entity that can encapsulate both the physical and mental state,” added Emery, “and it was great to recreate the essence of each orgasm into musical form.”</p>
<p>The aim of the project is to highlight the importance of sexual intimacy for everyone, no matter their age, sexual preference, or identity. “Intimacy comes in all shapes and forms,” Marcella Zanchi, LELO’s marketing and communications manager, said in a press statement, “so what is stopping us from exploring the exciting realms of satisfaction? Music triggers powerful emotions, and with this unique album, we hope to inspire people to embrace the power of intimacy and self-love.”</p>

<p>Another day, another terrifying development in the ‘robots taking over the planet’ timeline, as scientists have managed to develop “living robots” that are capable of reproduction.</p>
<p>Known as Xenobots, the organisms use a new form of self-replication, according to new research in the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/"><em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em></a> journal. The authors of the study <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/living-robots-can-now-reproduce-xenobots-self-replicate">discovered</a> that the “machines” are capable of gathering hundreds of single cells, and assemble them into “baby” Xenobots. The offspring then evolve – after only a few days – to look and behave just like their parents.</p>
<p>“People have thought for quite a long time that we’ve worked out all the ways that life can reproduce or replicate,” <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/living-robots-can-now-reproduce-xenobots-self-replicate">said</a> study co-author Douglas Blackiston, the senior scientist at Tufts University. “But this is something that’s never been observed before.”</p>
<p>Below, Dazed asks Blackiston some very important questions regarding his discovery (like, do the robots fancy each other?), and finds out just how worried we should be.</p><p><strong>In what sense are these robots “living”, and in what sense are they “machines”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglas Blackiston:</strong> As far as being a robot: the first use of the word was from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.U.R.">Czech play by Karel Čapek</a> 100 years ago, where he described the ‘robots’ as being built out of organic matter. It turns out that engineering with synthetic materials like steel, wood, springs, etc, advanced much more quickly than engineering with biology, so robotics turned to inorganic systems. However, in the past 10 years, we’ve started to see bio-hybrid robots, which combine living tissues with traditional non-living materials. Much like those systems, we design our systems for a human purpose and make use of computer simulation – a traditional robotics approach. Whether or not they are truly ‘living robots’ is certainly up for debate – I find roboticists are comfortable with this categorisation, while biologists are skeptical.</p>
<p>What we build in the lab is definitely living, because it’s made from cells. We collect the cells from amphibian embryos, which are then used as the building blocks for our designs. Some we build from the ground up, much like Lego or Minecraft, incorporating muscle tissue at specific locations to allow the design to ‘walk’. For others, we use small balls of developing skin, called an animal cap, which are known to form small hairs on their surface. These hairs normally beat to move slime across the tadpole’s skin and keep pathogens away, but because the animal caps are small, the hairs generate enough force to propel the design through the water.</p>
<p><strong>How do they reproduce, exactly?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglas Blackiston:</strong><strong> </strong>The word reproduce has a lot of biological qualifiers, so in the report we use the more general ‘replicate’. We provide a field of loose amphibian cells, then add a number of our moving designs. As they move, the cells are first pushed into small piles, then into large piles. Because the cells stick to each other, the piles form stable spheres, and over the course of a few days develop into a second generation of motile forms.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="zuo2DP72vKQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zuo2DP72vKQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>Do the robots have sexual preferences?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglas Blackiston: </strong>An interesting aspect of this kind of replication, compared to what we see on earth, is that nothing is passed from one generation to the next. There’s no preference of any kind because the system is ‘blind’ to what it’s doing – the motile forms simply move around in predictable ways (without input from their environment), and piling happens naturally.</p>
<p><strong>Where does AI come into the equation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglas Blackiston: </strong>It turns out spheres are not very efficient at making piles or pushing small objects. So we asked the <a href="/tag/artificial-intelligence">AI</a> to simulate many thousands of possible shapes, and provide us with one that makes piles faster or of a larger size. It turns out a ‘C’ shape works really well. In hindsight this seems intuitive – snow plows are quite efficient at pushing and piling up loose snow, much like our ‘C’ shapes are efficient at pushing and piling up loose cells.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There’s no need to worry. Unless you have loose frog stem cells floating around your waterway in very high concentrations, you would never see this happen outside the petri dish” – Douglas Blackiston</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Should we be worried about them taking over the world?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglas Blackiston: </strong>There’s no need to worry. Unless you have loose frog stem cells floating around your waterway in very high concentrations, you would never see this happen outside the petri dish. In fact, when frogs shed their skin, there’s often some living cells that come off, and we don’t see them going on to pose a risk. In addition, from a practical standpoint, any studies using living cells are subject to institutional, state, and federal oversight. We must give approval before we begin our work, and comply with rules safeguarding the use and disposal of biological tissue.</p>
<p><strong>What real-world applications will these findings lead to, and what’s the next step for you in this line of research?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Douglas Blackiston: </strong>Building and designing biological systems is really exciting. If you could design an ‘organism’ from the ground up, like a robot with a programmed behaviour, what would you have it do? There are many places where traditional robots have problems, like inside the human body. So you could imagine building a microscopic design from human cells, which could sense tissue damage and release compounds to help with healing. Alternatively, you could design a living biosensor, which you release in a waterway and it records information about pollution as it moves downstream. These applications are still a way off but are the types of things we frequently discuss with the team.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54945</id><title type="text">Elon Musk thinks we’re living in the Matrix</title><summary type="html">The tech billionaire previously stated that there's a ‘billion to one chance’ that our reality isn’t real</summary><published>2021-12-01T17:17:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-01T17:17:00Z</updated><author><name>Hannah Bertolino</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/54945/1/elon-musk-thinks-were-living-in-the-matrix-simulation?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=elon-musk-thinks-we-re-living-in-the-matrix" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[





<h1 class="fl-title">Elon Musk thinks we’re living in the Matrix</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The tech billionaire previously stated that there's a ‘billion to one chance’ that our reality isn’t real</h3>

<p>As if releasing <a href="/science-tech/article/53900/1/elon-musk-is-unleashing-humanoid-tesla-bots-into-the-world">humanoid Tesla bots</a> into the world and <a href="/science-tech/article/54181/1/space-x-has-launched-the-first-ever-pedestrian-flight-to-space">shipping tourists to outer space</a> wasn’t unsettling enough, tech billionaire <a href="/tag/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> stated last night (November 30) that we’re most likely living in a hyperreal computer simulation.</p>
<p>Replying to a <a href="https://twitter.com/engineers_feed/status/1465389600021659658?s=20">tweet</a> about <em>Pong</em> – Atari’s first-ever commercially successful video game, released in 1972 – Musk explained that advancements in video game graphics imply that we could be on track to create worlds indistinguishable from our reality. “49 years later, games are photo-realistic 3D worlds,” he wrote. “What does that trend continuing imply about our reality?”</p>
<p>Musk previously stated that there’s a “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKRuI2zHp0amp;ab_channel=Dr.Infographicshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBKRuI2zHp0amp;ab_channel=Dr.Infographics">billion to one chance</a>” that we’re living in a simulation, citing<strong> </strong>Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom’s 2003 <a href="https://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.pdf">paper</a>, titled <em>Are You Living in a Computer Simulation</em>, as evidence. Bostrom’s argument states that if even one civilisation can simulate conscious beings with computing power, then billions of highly detailed civilisations can be simulated in the likeness of their forebears.</p>
<p>“It could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race,” the philosopher explains.</p><p>Back in 2016, at the Recode Code Conference, Musk backed up Bostrom’s claims. “If you assume any rate of improvement at all then games will become indistinguishable from reality,” he said. “Even if that rate of advancement drops by a thousand from what it is now, let's just imagine it’s 10,000 years in the future, which is nothing on the evolutionary scale.” Perhaps we’re all just hyperreal characters in the latest video game simulation then? TBH, it doesn’t seem all that unlikely.</p>
<p>Last month, theoretical physicist and former chair of Harvard’s astronomy department, Abraham ‘Avi’ Loeb, proposed his own simulation theory: that our universe was intentionally created by a more advanced class of lifeform. In an op-ed for <em>Scientific American</em>, “<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com./article/was-our-universe-created-in-a-laboratory/">Was Our Universe Created In A Laboratory?</a>”, Loeb suggested that aliens may have created a “baby universe” with “quantum tunneling” – perhaps justifying why our universe has flat geometry and zero net energy.</p>
<p>Speaking to Dazed, he explained that scientists are on track to producing a baby universe of their own (AKA their own mini simulations). “We are getting close to producing synthetic life in our laboratories,” Loeb says. “Once we will understand how to unify quantum mechanics and gravity, we might know how to make a baby universe in the laboratory.”</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">BTS super producer Adora on finding her voice as a soloist</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Having appeared anonymously on some of the best-known tracks by BTS and TXT, the producer and singer is stepping into a solo career in her own right – here’s why she’s looking to craft memorable songs over chart hits</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU_IwNFJGuA">Hidden vocals</a> are an open secret in the <a href="/tag/k-pop">K-pop</a> world, a sometimes overlooked – yet welcome – addition to our favourite tracks. For <a href="/tag/bts">BTS</a> fans, aka Army, it’s always been widely appreciated. While women are largely overlooked in the producing and songwriting world, they tend to have a tangible presence on the most timeless songs. On ballads like the emotional “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEeFrLSkMm8">Spring Day</a>” or the ephemeral “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_R0-YosZ3g">Love Maze</a>”, you’ll likely hear an angelic female voice blending effortlessly into the vocals by the biggest boyband in the world. Now, it’s time for that voice to shine on its own.</p>
<p>24-year-old Adora, born Park Soo-Hyun, was originally introduced as the only female in-house producer on Big Hit Music’s team. Almost five years later, and her solo debut aspirations are finally coming to fruition. It’s why her excitement for her moment is palpable through a Zoom call, where she sits readily with her short pink hair and a genuine smile on her face. Her work on other K-pop artists’ music has allowed her a distinct perspective as she debuts with new company AURA Entertainment. It’s nighttime in Seoul, around 4am, but Adora is just as lively as she would be in the middle of the day. It’s because music is her passion, full stop.</p><p>When asked how she feels about this new venture, Adora is honest. “First off, this was a dream job of mine for a very long time. So I am very happy and excited, but also very nervous. Honestly, I’m quite nervous about everything, especially about how I can give everyone good music in the future. Even with “Make U Dance”, which just came out, I think I was very worried about how it would be received.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="FJEMvgncrBw"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJEMvgncrBw" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>The song features Eunha, a former member of GFRIEND and current member of soon-to-debut group ViviZ. It’s an electronic, high energy, alt-pop track that proves a bold and unique debut for Adora. Speaking about the collab, she likens Eunha’s contribution as a perfect contrast to her own singing style. “Unlike my voice, she has a very bright and clear tone, which I think amplifies the paradoxical element of the song. So to compare, I would say Eunha is like the angel of a fairytale fantasy and I’m the devil in a grim fairytale!”</p>
<p>The singer goes on to explain that she doesn’t want to be limited by a specific genre. “Make U Dance” surely encapsulates Adora’s ability to experiment, but even with the feats she’s accomplished, she’s looking ahead to new possibilities. “Even when I worked as a producer, I still felt like I lacked a lot of musical experience. So I want to try lots of new things in the future without any limitations,” she says.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Because this was a song written for (BTS), it was slightly difficult to really consider or even show my own artistry in the song itself” – Adora</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When asked about her work with groups like BTS and TXT, she glows with positivity. “They are very big artists. So just being able to work with them made me very happy and honoured. I was able to gain a very bright career and if I had to do it alone, I probably couldn’t have come this far. That’s how I learned a lot about the power of working together, not only with music, but in the sense of the industry itself.” This comes as no surprise, as Adora’s hand on Big Hit artists’ discography is vast. Because of that connection, the question of what track reflects her own tastes the best comes up naturally in conversation. “Out of all the songs I participated in, there is a song called “Wings”, which is the first song I worked on, so I feel more affection towards that song. Because this was a song written for (BTS), it was slightly difficult to really consider or even show my own artistry in the song itself. But you can look forward to seeing my own colour and style as an artist through my own music in the future!”</p>
<p>We reminisce a bit more on Adora’s musical journey, and the determination she has for a successful solo career shines through. She explains how she was a trainee for a long time while working as a producer, although singing was her first dream. “Due to health issues, I had to take a break. So the biggest difference is that I have to sing the song myself, but it was a little harder to set the standard of what is good and what suits me, and looking at myself objectively.” </p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p>Taking the leap to finally make her debut may have been a new challenge, but Adora was ready and chose a company that would allow her to be true to herself. “When I first met up with AURA, they asked me a lot about what I wanted. They always had confidence in me and I thought this company could solve any potential problems through communication. That was the biggest reason.” The choice was evidently a good one, as she seems happy, comfortable, and hungry to explore more of the possibilities a solo career entails.</p>
<p>Outside of her own work, it’s evident in Adora’s personal taste that her music history knowledge runs deep, and is less interested in trends than she is in crafting songs that people will remember and appreciate. She highlights American alternative/indie artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/upsahlmusic/?hl=en">Upsahl</a> as her current favourite. “I recently listened to this artist’s full album. Within one song, she uses scales in a very colourful and fun way. That’s what inspires me a lot and teaches me so much!” It’s this hopeful perspective that proves Adora will go far. Even when discussing her future, chart positions and numbers are never the goal. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t want to obsess over how well my music does on the charts. I just want to receive and share good energy!” – Adora</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead, she wants a career that’s a touch more purposeful. “First, I hope my music can reach many people. That’s my goal. I want to look far into the future and show steady growth! So I don’t want to obsess over how well my music does on the charts. I just want to receive and share good energy!” With the cheerful vibes of her debut, she’s well on her way to accomplishing this.</p>
<p>From just one chat with Adora, it’s impossible not to notice the relatable yet magnetic star power she radiates. At such a young age, she’s rightfully gained respect that few women, in the South Korean industry or beyond, have been able to find with producing. It gives her an autonomy over her sound that shouldn’t be overlooked. Her touch on some of the best K-pop songs of our generation will never be forgotten, but it’s high time she gets her own flowers.</p>

<p>For those looking to brush up on their fashion illustration skills: you’re in luck. London-based <a href="/tag/central-saint-martins">Central Saint Martins</a> designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_isabella_blue_/">Isabella Smith</a> is inviting guests to sketch her transformative <a href="/aw21">AW21</a> collection at 180 The Strand’s <a href="https://www.reference-point.uk/home">Reference Point</a> space.</p>
<p>Besides life drawing and drinks, guests will get a first look at Smith’s new collection – an exploration of stripped back, distorted glamour, displayed through subversive gowns, swirling patterns, and futuristic metal accessories. </p><p>"This collection forms a dialogue between our garments and ourselves, how they act both as a projection of the self and a protective shell,” said Smith, crediting Southern France’s abandoned Hotel Provence and English author JG Ballard’s 1973 cult fetish novel, <em>Crash</em>, as inspirations. </p>
<p>“(Ballard) describes one of the protagonists as ‘sat in the damaged car like a deity occupying a shrine…reborn within the breaking contours of her crushed sports car’,” added the designer. “This inspired me to work with metal, seeking to echo the forms of rich folds of fabric and explore how it relates to the body whilst taking the car as an iconic symbol of glamour and warping it."</p>

<p>While the convergent forces of social media, coronavirus, and the climate crisis give today something of a unique flavour, coming of age in 2021 is much like how it’s always been, steered by hormonal imbalances, desire, and playground politics. For SS22, <a href="/tag/acne">Acne Studios</a> have zeroed in on the best of years (and worst of years) with its Face collection, comprising blown out basketball tops emblazoned with angsty Edward Munch prints, slouchy knits which twist the label’s trademark smiley into an uncertain slant, and varsity-striped balaclavas. Real life teenagers feature in the campaign imagery, enveloped in snakes, half mohawks, split brows, and pet geckos, all lensed by <a href="/tag/harley-weir">Harley Weir</a>. </p><p>With the expanse of adulthood stretching at their feet, it’s clear these young people are just beginning to assert their independence. To move out. To come out. To make money. To have sex. And to escape their families. As such, the models were all asked to style themselves, mixing pieces from the capsule into their own wardrobe. It means bags come laden with safety pins and studs while crystals and healing herbs dangle from the necks of young women, which is testament to the timelessness of teenage spirit – or at least its aesthetic. Below, the Acne Studios muses share their plans for graduation, their style icons, and the fashion rules they live by.</p>

<p>“The first thing I wanna do when I leave school is lie down and catch up on social media and stuff. It’s a really interesting way of watching the world function, it represents people at their most extreme. It’s kind of like a social experiment of sorts – put the whole world in your hand and see what you get. My favourite piece of clothing I own is probably my puffer jacket, which I made out of my old school blazer and sewed a bunch of patches and studs on it. I like that I can build on it and that it’s a work in progress. I also decorated my room with Monster cans after I saw a TikTok of someone doing the same.” </p>

<p>“When I leave school I wanna get as far away as possible. My style in three words would be lost, expressionist, and spiralling. I have lots of old Eastern pieces of clothing but nothing, like, embarrassing. My favourite piece of clothing would be this blue East Asian style dress, which I got from a charity shop. It’s reminiscent of one of my mother’s.”</p>

<p>“When I grow up I want to be a computer scientist because technology is really fascinating, we’re always surrounded by it. There needs to be a limit, like on social media, so that people don’t start comparing themselves to others. My style is like, quirky, funky, and fun. I’ve always been a fan of red so I just decided to dye my hair that colour. Since I’ve done red, though, I might go blue next time. I’ve gone with fire, I’ll go with sea. When I’m out of school I want to use my youth to travel the world. I want to go abroad and try things I’ve never tried before. I’m quite interested in East Asian culture, Chinese is my favourite subject at school. It’s a beautiful language and culture.”</p>

<p>“The first thing I did when I left school was breathe a sigh of relief! I mean I’m still in school but it’s a lot different now to what it used to be, I get to actually choose what I want to do. School is an interesting experience. I was always hiding myself but I don’t care anymore. I just get on with it. It helps to learn about yourself but when you leave it’s so much better. Most of my clothes aren’t mine. A lot of it comes from my family – they just hand it to me after they’ve worn it for 20 years. I give the items a few more years and I really hold onto them because they’re not my own. I have way too many hoodies, though. A lot of shops nowadays don’t give me what I’m looking for.”</p>

<p>“My favourite artist is Tracey Emin, she’s so different from all the others, so unique. My style’s interesting, sometimes it’s colourful but mostly it’s just different. I have so many clothes but my favourite item is this racing car jacket, it’s red and Budweiser. I thrift a lot and Kate Moss is my style icon. When I leave school I want to be happy, not doing anything specific, just living life.”</p>

<p>“The first thing I did when I left school was binge Freecycle for things I could put in my new house. My style is very chaotic, I wear a lot of layers. I like to wear skirts over trousers and then usually like two or three tops meshed into one, then like a tie or something. It’s usually just like materials that I find and drape them into various forms, whatever feels comfy. You know, I had been cutting my hair so much over lockdown that there just wasn’t a lot left, so that’s why I started on my brows. I wouldn’t even call them slits, they’re full-on gaps at this point.”</p>

<p>“My dream is to eventually become a musician because I like singing but the first thing I did when I left school was look for a job. I like all types of different clothing. Different, dark, and original. When I find things that I don’t usually wear I definitely try it on. My style icon is Lil Peep.”</p>

<p>“I wanna move back to Thailand but the first thing I wanna do when I leave school is get drunk – wait, what should I say? That was inappropriate. The first thing I wanna do when I leave school is travel Europe with my friends. Probably France or Italy. I’d describe my style as Japanese, earthy, and, erm, I dunno. The inspiration for my blue hair was from watching a lot of Anime, so yeah, but I first dyed my hair back in the summer of 2019. I bleached it and it almost fell out. I’ve found a better hairdresser since then.”</p>

<p>“I share my room with my sister, and it’s not that fun, so I’d like to go travelling. Maybe to Italy. I watched <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> when I was younger and it influenced me a lot. But David Bowie is a huge influence, too. Definitely his fashion. As I get older I’d like to get more into that glam rock kind of style. I wanna go into something creative eventually. Maybe become a lecturer. Or an artist.”</p>

<p>“I get inspiration from people with gothic outfits and I also love streetwear, even if I don’t wear it as much. I really like silver jewellery and wear loads. I watch a lot of makeup videos on YouTube, people like Eve Fraser. My style icon is Rui Gao on YouTube, her outfits are really good. When I grow up I want to be someone in a creative industry – maybe costume design or hair and makeup.” </p>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54903</id><title type="text">44 LABEL GROUP pays homage to Berlin’s riotous club scene</title><summary type="html">Max Kobosil joins forces with Matt Lambert to present a short film for his SS22 collection</summary><published>2021-12-01T14:17:56Z</published><updated>2021-12-01T14:17:56Z</updated><author><name>Dazed Digital</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/54903/1/max-kobosils-44-label-group-pays-homage-to-berlins-riotous-club-scene?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=44-label-group-pays-homage-to-berlin-s-riotous-club-scene" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[





<h1 class="fl-title">44 LABEL GROUP pays homage to Berlin’s riotous club scene</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Max Kobosil joins forces with Matt Lambert to present a short film for his SS22 collection</h3>

<p>When he’s not spinning decks at 140bpm, or running his own R – Label Group imprint, techno veteran Max Kobosil is creating effortless clubwear inspired by Berlin’s riotous nightlife.</p>
<p>The 30-year-old is a fixture of the Berlin underground scene. A former Berghain resident, Kobosil’s techno is dark, fast, and aggressive. It pummels your brain with gritty analogue bass and searing kickdrums and leaves you wanting more.</p>
<p>After years of highly-coveted merch drops on his record label – each selling out faster than the next – Kobosil launched his official fashion brand <a href="https://44labelgroup.com/">44 LABEL GROUP</a> earlier this year. Named after the postcode for the Neukölln borough where Kobosil was born and raised, the collection spans everything from outerwear to hoodies, t-shirts to trousers, and accessories. With the tagline “Every dark night has a bright end”, the label is effortlessly edgy, inspired by Berlin club culture and the people who shape it. </p><p>For his SS22 collection, the designer joins forces with visionary director <a href="/matt-lambert">Matt Lambert</a>, to present a new short film which further expands on the brand’s ethos. Described as an “ode to Berlin’s infamous hedonism”, the film captures the sense of freedom and endless euphoria of the city’s nightlife. Think: Sweaty bodies in blacked-out basements raves.</p>
<p>Below, we speak to Kobosil about his earliest clubbing memories, Berlin nightlife, and the new collection.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-brightcove" data-id="6284318567001"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="//players.brightcove.net/5972928229001/caIGZ7r8z_default/index.html?videoId=6284318567001" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>What are some of your earliest memories of clubbing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>:</strong> I was 14 and wanted to enter a club but I was refused because I was too young.</p>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite memory of DJing? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>There are too many good memories to just reduce it into one specific place or situation. But one special moment was when I played at a big festival with over 10,000 people for the first time. It was unreal to me that so many people were listening to my music. That occasion was also very meaningful to me because I brought my mother and we both couldn’t believe where I had arrived after all those years annoying her with my bedroom DJ gigs when I was a teenager.</p>
<p>Also worth mentioning are my first intercontinental gigs in South and North America, Asia, and Australia. It showed me that hard work and to never stop dreaming can take you everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>What do you like about techno specifically?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>The big kick drums hitting hard on big sound systems is what gives you the fundamental feeling of techno. The togetherness and unity on the floor that is built for said kick drums and dancing to the same rhythm.</p>
<p><strong>How did the idea for the label come about? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>It started through selling merchandise for my record label. The 44 motif and the decision to use it was the game changer. It’s the old Berlin postcode for the area where I was born and grew up. A lot of my childhood friends can relate to this because it was neither only about techno nor me or my label. </p>
<p>After we launched the first drop, which sold out immediately, we increased the number of t-shirts every year – but luckily managed to sell out fast. Sometimes too fast. For one drop it only took eight minutes to sell the entire shop. After our last drop in 2020, where we thought we produced so much that we would be stocked for the rest of the year, it took 15 minutes to sell out. It took us five to six weeks to send out everything. Thousands of orders. It was insane. Right there and then we knew we needed professional distribution.</p>
<p><strong>The group’s mantra is ‘every dark night has a bright end’, what do you mean by that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>It’s a positive meaning and the core motto of my life. I was going through some private difficulties when I thought of this and immediately could relate to it. Darkness and light belong together and will always be present. We just have to remind ourselves of that.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><strong>What about techno and club culture inspired the collection? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>Club culture and nightlife was my first love and real passion. I never knew or learned anything else than that before starting with fashion. Traveling for shows all over the world and experiencing so many influences is a never ending source of inspiration I bring into my work as creative director.</p>
<p><strong>How does that translate to the garments? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>The functional shapes, the roughness, and gender fluid approach already shows the influence I experienced in techno culture. It’s our first collection and we’ve just started the journey. There is so much more to communicate and I can’t wait to share my ideas and vision.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe the relationship between techno and fashion? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>Many trends were born in the nightlife of the electronic music scene. People are dressing up for the night and expressing themselves even if it’s just a chain from the hardware store.</p>
<p><strong>What made you choose to collaborate with Matt Lambert? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>Matt is a true artist and a legend in the scene. I luckily got introduced to him by my friend Marc Göhring, and asked him if he would be up for it. I think no director can visualise club culture quite like him. You can feel he has a lot of experience when you see his work.</p>
<p><strong>How important is collaboration to you generally?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>Super important, I would love to collaborate more with the right partners. I believe it makes a project more interesting when worlds clash together.</p>
<p><strong>Where do you see the brand going moving forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Max Kobosil</strong><strong>: </strong>If you told me one year ago I would be here sitting and talking to Dazed Fashion I wouldn’t believe it. So who knows where we will be one year from now.</p>

<p>Can fashion people read? The high street isn’t convinced. Traditionally, the fashion section of any major bookshop comprises a (very) sparse bookcase with titles that look as though they’ve been sourced from a carboot sale. Hidden away in the basement or crammed into some far off corner, the love given to these shelves reads as a pitiful allegory for the way in which wider society views the industry. Like in Waterstones Gower Street, where the fashion department doubles as an enclave to the toilets. Where “Art and Architecture” is lined with criticism and the voices of trailblazing tastemakers, “Fashion” is home to <em>Witty Quotes and Wise Words from Coco Chanel</em> and <em>A Beginner’s Guide to Cross Stitch. </em>Don’t judge a book by its cover but when they’re adorned with glitter pink stilettos or the smirk of a mid-aughts TV stylist, you get the impression that just about everyone else does.</p><p>Yet the marriage of books and looks has proved a powerful one this year, with the rich bitch teens of <em>Gossip Girl</em> and <em>White Lotus</em> toting Eve Babitz, Elena Ferrante, Kennedy Fraser, and Nietzsche as if they were Chiquitos or Motorcycle bags. It’s a phenomenon which came to an unfortunate head when Emily Ratajowski released a collection of entirely underwhelming essays, which lacked both self awareness and thoughtful critique. The desire to telegraph cultural capital is so widespread, in fact, that people are even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@noelthebrand/video/6898451527946603781?lang=en">faking Tom Ford tomes on TikTok</a>. Perhaps that’s to do authors a disservice, though, given that the past twelve months have seen the publication of brilliant fashion titles like <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/314590/what-artists-wear/9780141991252"><em>What Artists Wear</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-ten/lauren-cochrane/9781787395053"><em>The Ten</em></a><em>, </em>and behemoth brand bibles from <a href="/user/alexanderfury">Alexander Fury</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/timblanks/?hl=en">Tim Blanks</a>.

<h1 class="fl-title">Circa is broadcasting a ‘viral’ activist film to commemorate World AIDS Day</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">General Idea’s AA Bronson has created an animation that will be shown on billboards in London, Milan, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo</h3>

<p>In recognition of World AIDS Day, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/circa.art/?hl=en">Circa</a> is collaborating with artist AA Bronson on a “viral” animation that will transmit activist messages across billboards in London, Milan, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo.</p>
<p>The VideoVirus project is part of a partnership with UNAIDS and Terrence Higgins Trust to mark 40 years since the disease was first recorded in 1981. </p>
<p>For the animation, AA Bronson – the sole surviving member of Canadian art trio General Idea – drew inspiration from the collective’s 1980s Imagevirus series of paintings, posters, and exhibitions that investigated AIDS as a viral transmission through word and image.</p>
<p>Building on Imagevirus’ original intention of rendering visible an ignored crisis, VideoVirus aims to celebrate our progress toward the eradication of AIDS.</p>
<p>“General Idea first developed the concept of viral images in the early 1970s. In the mid-80s that work became prophetically and tragically true, with the appearance of the HIV virus. In 1987 we exhibited our first AIDS painting and papered lower Manhattan with AIDS posters in the hope of making the image indeed viral,” said Bronson in a statement. </p>
<p>“35 years later, and marking the 40th anniversary of AIDS first being recorded, I am honoured to join the CIRCA platform with this reimagined VideoVirus. General Idea’s VideoVirus replicates the spread of HIV to the four corners of the world; it expands General Idea's signature theme of ‘image as virus’ for a global audience,” he added.</p>
<p></p><p>Founded in Toronto in 1969, General Idea began as a collaboration between AA Bronson, Felix Partz, and Jorge Zontal. </p>
<p>The group’s transgressive artworks challenged social power structures and traditional artistic formats until Partz and Zontal’s untimely deaths from AIDS-related causes in 1994.</p>
<p>“With nearly 1.5 million new HIV infections and 680,000 deaths each year, the AIDS epidemic is far from over. But it can be. AA Bronson’s art is a powerful reminder of sacrifices made by activists and people living with HIV and to learn from them to tackle not just HIV, but all pandemics. We are proud to partner with CIRCA in bringing attention to the AIDS pandemic at a time when we are fighting both COVID-19 and AIDS,” said Mahesh Mahalingam, director, communications, and global advocacy at UNAIDS. </p>
<p>As well as broadcasting VideoVirus on billboards across the world, CIRCA is announcing an online programme of talks and informative videos guest-curated by LGBTQ+ charity QUEERCIRCLE. The organisation has been awarded a grant of £5,000 to deliver an artist-led participatory residency with HIV positive women during their 2022 winter season.</p>
<p>Bronson has also created two limited-edition prints that are available to purchase on the circa.art website, with proceeds going towards the <a href="https://circa.art/circaeconomy/">#CIRCAECONOMY</a> programme.</p>
<p>“Four decades since AIDS was first recorded, CIRCA is honoured to collaborate with AA Bronson and dedicate its global, public platform to commemorating an epidemic that society once ignored,” said Josef O’Connor, artistic director at CIRCA.</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">December 2021 horoscope: let go of unhealthy habits this Sagittarius season</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Sagittarius season promises us a higher perspective, where we take all of the hardships, break-ups, and transformation we underwent in Scorpio season and choose a brand new direction</h3>

<p>We’re closing out 2021 with a firework display of astrological configurations, as we enter Sagittarius season, undergo another eclipse, and then catapult into Venus retrograde. This promises to be an eventful holiday season. Neptune, planet of psychic insights, the imagination and dreams, stations direct at the beginning of  month, adding a dreamy air of unreality to December. Sagittarius season promises us a higher perspective, where we take all of the hardships, break-ups, and transformation we underwent in Scorpio season and choose a brand new direction. On December 4th, a Solar Eclipse in the sign of the Archer encourages us to pick a new perspective, and truly lean into new experiences. As always with eclipses, they are astrological wild cards that incite lasting life changes, and this one promises a fresh start – as long as we can pick a positive outlook.</p>
<p>Sagittarians are known for their appetite for adventure and eagerness to experience life as a perpetual journey. We can be steadfast and eager to restore faith an optimism to areas we have previously been cynical about. On the 13th, Mars enters Sagittarius, giving us itchy feet and making us vocal about our opinions. On the flipside, we have to watch out for a propensity to overshare and dish out unsolicited advice, believing that our opinions outweigh our fellows. It’s a time to adopt a more inclusive perspective, and set our sights on a new domain.</p><p>A Full Moon in Gemini on December 18th can shed light on hidden information, and amplifies our desire to communicate. Remember, in 2021 we had four retrogrades in air signs, encouraging us to speak our truth, even if we are hesitant to reveal our perspective. In the sign of the twins, we are curious, animated, and chatty – and encouraged to air out old emotions by processing them verbally.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, on the 19th, pleasure planet Venus stations retrograde in Capricorn. When Venus is in Capricorn, we are concerned with the longevity and practicality of our connections, our finances, and material achievement in the world at large. Here, we may be revisiting old flames to check if they have matured, and we are given a reality check on our financial habits. No-nonsense Capricorn has little tolerance for unfair power plays and time-wasters, so we may find ourselves having to reinstate boundaries with both our loved ones and our pocket books. As Venus conjoins Pluto towards the end of the month, expect for hidden information to come to light, as we deepen our psychological insights into our fellows.</p>
<p>On the 21st, the Sun enters hard-working Capricorn, and we are ready to harden our resolve for growth and let go of the unhealthy habits (some of which were procured by overindulgence in Sagittarius season.) Thankfully, the month ends on a calmer note, when Jupiter, planet of belief and abundance, enters dreamy Pisces. Here, we are able to surrender old emotional material and anchor in spiritual support.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>What’s on your Christmas list this year? Maybe it’s a new laptop, a winter coat, or a candle that’s just a little bit more bougie than what you would buy for yourself. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/giulianocalza/?hl=en">Giuliano Calza</a> at <a href="/tag/gcds">GCDS</a> wants us to remember a time when our wish lists weren't quite so practical. When the aisles of Woolworths in December set our hearts racing. When Christmas morning started with rushing downstairs to see what Santa had delivered overnight. When we ripped open wrapping paper to find the Bratz doll we’d been dreaming of for months. </p>
<p>The new GCDS Bratz collaboration is steeped in this nostalgia, tapping into our modern obsession with Y2K and offering a playful antidote to these turbulent times. Cropped hoodies, bodycon minis, and the signature GCDS heart bag are all given a Bratz makeover. Loungewear is emblazoned with the iconic tagline "passion for fashion” and Bratz prints covers shorts, dresses, and bralets. And that’s not all. The collection also includes two limited edition Bratz dolls worthy of writing to Santa for. Sasha’s look is pure glam with a diamante mini, fur coat, and over the knee white boots, while Yasmin wears a cute Bratz print mini accessorised with GCDS’ iconic cat shape sunglasses.  </p><p>This is for the kids who grew up dreaming of dressing like a Bratz doll. Calza describes the collaboration as “a match made in heaven,” noting that GCDS and Bratz share the same values of playfulness and inclusivity even if they’re sometimes misunderstood. Here, we chat with Giuliano about the collection, creating your own fantasy, and why the Bratz remain our favourite 00s style icons. </p>
<p><strong>Hey Giuliano! How did the Bratz collaboration come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>When MGA first contacted me and said they’d love to do a Bratz collaboration I started screaming like a 10-year-old girl before Christmas! I said, absolutely yes! I grew up with Bratz. At the very beginning of my career, everyone was saying they didn’t really understand what I was doing and I remember when Bratz launched they got the same reaction. They were not the right look at the time. So it really made sense to do this collab with them.</p>
<p> <strong>What do Bratz and GCDS have in common?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>Bratz were some of the first dolls to not all be the same or set the same beauty standards. That's what's so important for me. In all my castings, I look to discover something new, something that is echoing with the people at home. With my brand, I’ve always wanted to make people dream as if they were tiny kids. You have to see things that make your heart go boom. That’s what I wanted to do with GCDS and that’s what Bratz still does. It was a match made in heaven.</p>	<figure>

<p><strong>How would you describe this collection?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>For me, the most important thing was to stay playful. We live in such a heavy world. Why would you want to do heavy things? I think it should be fun. It should be pop. It should be a fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Did styling a doll feel different from styling a living person?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>It was just more fun. Sometimes when I'm doing my job and designing a collection, I have to remind myself that this has to be on the streets at some point. There are runway pieces and then there are commercial pieces, things that people will live in over and over. With a doll, I had no boundaries. I could create my fantasy of what I would be like if I was a doll living in California. Styling a crystal dress with fur and a jumpsuit and a boot might be too much in real life. </p>
<p><strong>Why do you think so many adults still love Bratz today?</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>I think they were a bit ahead of the time so if at the beginning they were wrong, now they are completely right. They have a sass and a comedy about them that’s unapologetically fun.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Bratz were some of the first dolls to not all be the same or set the same beauty standards. That's what's so important for me” – Giuliano Calza</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>You use the “passion for fashion” tagline as a motif throughout the collection. What does the line mean to you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>I always fantasised about this ‘passion for fashion’. It's something that's been echoing in my mind for so long. It's this idea of having passion for the things you do because of course you have to believe in it 100 per cent and you have to challenge yourself to be you when you do my job. At the same time, you have to have this irony and light tone that fashion is about to remind you at the end of the day you're creating art and vision but it's clothing and it has to be something that cheers us up instead of setting the tone for something boring.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any particular toys, books or films that you encountered in childhood that have impacted your work and creativity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>I didn't have too many toys as a kid. I had lots of books, lots of movies, and lots of cartoons. I was lucky enough to live in a house with a garden so I had the chance to play a lot. I think the fact that I didn't have too many toys made me willing to create my own toys. What you miss the most as a kid is what you want to have in life when you grow up. </p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Aleia, Breakfast For Dinner</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>Bratz taught us that it's okay to be different. What advice would you give to kids who are struggling to fit in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>For me, this was the most important message. To share my message I wouldn't go with classic dolls that embodied just one standard. I always talk to the kids and they said I cast people they can see themselves in. I would tell them that my success is thanks to following what I believe in. I think we should learn how to appreciate who we are. Being authentic in the long run is the only thing that's going to help you survive in any job or craft. I don't think you can fake it ‘til you make it.</p>
<p><strong>Although Bratz are more diverse than some other dolls, they still promote unrealistic body and beauty standards. What would you say about that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>No more than a phone! I think this is a really interesting conversation. Today parents give kids a phone when they're four and they can have YouTube and access to everything. Compared to that, dolls are not the main problem.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The most important thing (about designing this collection) was to stay playful. We live in such a heavy world. Why would you want to do heavy things? I think it should be fun. It should be pop. It should be a fantasy” – Giuliano Calza</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>Can you tell me about the GCDS Bratz pop-ups that are happening in December?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>Our pop-up in Milan is going to have these giant doll eyes spying on you from the window. There's going to be one in London on Peter's Street and there's going to be another one in Rome in my store. For Christmas, I want to make everyone go back to their parents and say, ‘I want to have a doll’. We are forgetting to live the time of our lives. We are forgetting that sometimes even stupid things are important. Even playing with dolls and imagining being that girl can be really therapeutic. Christmas magic is so important. When you open that box, sometimes it doesn't have to be an iPhone. Sometimes it doesn't have to be expensive. It can be a doll that is going to make you feel passion for fashion once again.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that Bratz have created a community where people can connect with each other?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Giuliano Calza: </strong>I hope so. I think they’re a way to connect by speaking a common language. It can be a doll or a book or poetry. I want to give value to these things.</p>]]></content></entry><entry><id>https://www.dazeddigital.com/54942</id><title type="text">Louis Vuitton pays tribute to Virgil Abloh at moving Miami show</title><summary type="html">The house’s SS22 presentation, dubbed ‘Virgil Was Here’, went ahead ‘per his wishes’</summary><published>2021-12-01T09:18:00Z</published><updated>2021-12-01T09:18:00Z</updated><author><name>Thom Waite</name><uri>https://www.dazeddigital.com/</uri><email>info@dazedgroup.com</email></author><link rel="alternate" href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/54942/1/louis-vuitton-pays-tribute-virgil-abloh-was-here-final-show-ss22-miami?utm_source=Link&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_campaign=Flipboard&amp;utm_term=louis-vuitton-pays-tribute-to-virgil-abloh-at-moving-miami-show" /><content type="html"><![CDATA[

<p>Just days after <a href="/virgil-abloh">Virgil Abloh</a> <a href="/fashion/article/54914/1/virgil-abloh-has-passed-away-died-louis-vuitton-off-white">passed away</a>, <a href="/louis-vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> has showcased his final collection in Miami, in accordance with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW2A_pbARzD/">his wishes</a>. Subtitled “Virgil Was Here”, the <a href="/ss22">SS22</a> presentation acted as a send-off for the boundary-breaking designer, but also a testament to his outlook on work and creativity – amid a private battle with cancer, he’s said to have worked on the collection up until the very end, <a href="/fashion/article/54930/1/louis-vuitton-tribute-to-virgil-abloh-ss22-runway-miami">teasing</a> it on Instagram only four days before the news of his passing. Here’s everything you need to know about the show.</p>

<p>Across the course of his career, Abloh’s outlook had almost as much influence as his designs themselves. In the wake of his death, his <a href="/fashion/article/54932/1/virgil-abloh-inspiring-powerful-quotes-louis-vuitton-off-white">most memorable quotes</a> – incisive statements on the fashion industry, life lessons, the assertion that “you can do it too” – were shared by friends and fans alike, and so it was only fitting that Louis Vuitton tapped into that voice to open the show.</p>
<p>“I’ve been on this focus, in terms of my art and creativity, of getting adults to behave like children again,” he declared in the posthumous voiceover. “They go back, into this sense of wonderment. They start to stop using their mind, and they start using their imagination.”</p>
<p>Abloh’s massive presence in the fashion industry was also literally rendered in a three-storey statue, which loomed – alongside the red hot air balloon that lifts a child into the sky in the introductory short film – over the crowd that had gathered at the show-slash-tribute to the late designer.</p>

<p>Given that <a href="/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> has been by Abloh’s side since the latter was just a young graduate, it was no surprise to see him looking on as models strutted down the tree-lined catwalk. The rapper was accompanied by <a href="/fashion/article/52197/1/virgil-taps-21-savage-for-louis-vuittons-summer-capsule">recent Louis Vuitton model</a> <a href="/tag/21-savage">21 Savage</a>, Metro Boomin, <a href="/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>, and North West. <a href="/rihanna">Rihanna</a> and <a href="/asap-rocky">A$AP Rocky</a>, and Pharrell were also among the high-profile guests. </p>
<p><a href="/kid-cudi">Kid Cudi</a>, meanwhile, joined a characteristically-diverse array of models alongside Offset and Quavo.

<p>It would be a mistake to think of Abloh’s SS22 Louis Vuitton offering as a summary of his career, and not just one point in an astronomical trajectory that was tragically cut short. As a catalogue of the codes he established at the luxury house, though, the collection does do a pretty good job.</p>
<p>With the collection <a href="/fashion/article/53304/1/louis-vuitton-virgil-abloh-ss22-menswear-collection-goldie-gza-nike-collab">first dropping in June</a> this year via a short film, belted tailoring was paired with sky-high iterations of the stetson-style hats from the label’s <a href="/fashion/article/51718/1/louis-vuitton-fw21-collection-virgil-abloh-mos-def-saul-williams-menswear">AW21 collection</a>, and in the next breath a tracksuit top was layered with an oversized suit jacket (because streetwear <a href="/fashion/article/47195/1/virgil-abloh-end-of-2010s-interview-death-of-streetwear">isn’t quite dead</a> – note the skateboard one model carried down the runway). Elsewhere, we got skin-tight balaclavas and LV varsity jackets plastered with graffiti, with irreverent oversized earmuffs and fluffy pink deerstalkers for those feeling the chill off the water.</p>

<p>“It is with profound sorrow that I learned of the passing of Virgil Abloh,” wrote Louis Vuitton CEO and chairman Michael Burke in a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW2A_pbARzD/">statement</a> posted to Instagram November 29. “Virgil was not only a friend, great collaborator, creative genius, visionary and disruptor, but also one of the best cultural communicators of our times. He paved the way for future generations. As a devoted supporter of his community through his charities and passions, he was an eternal optimist who believed anything was possible.”</p>
<p>However, the label chose to round out his last show with another snippet of his voice, as members of his design team gathered to mourn the loss.</p>
<p>Abloh’s quote reverberated through the darkness by the port of Miami, before the sky was lit up by fireworks: “There’s no limit. Life is so short that you can’t waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do, versus knowing what you can do.”</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">And just like that, the full trailer for the SATC reboot has arrived</h1>

<p>With the <a href="/tag/sex-and-the-city"><em>Sex and the City</em></a> reboot, <em>And Just Like That</em>, just around the corner, <a href="/hbo">HBO Max</a> has shared the first full trailer, expanding on the short teaser that <a href="/film-tv/article/54780/1/carrie-bradshaw-fashion-sex-and-the-city-reboot-teaser-and-just-like-that">was released</a> on November 12.</p>
<p>The new preview seems to reveal that Carrie Bradshaw et al are still married — for now — and particularly highlights the relationship between Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) and Mr Big (Chris Noth), who are seen getting nostalgic about their life together.</p>
<p>Big isn’t all Carrie reminisces about in the trailer, though, as she also spends time discussing whether she’s ever masturbated in a public place on her podcast with Che Diaz, the <a href="/film-tv/article/52843/1/sex-and-the-city-casts-first-non-binary-character-sara-ramiez-and-just-like-that">non-binary comic and podcaster</a> played by Sara Ramíez. (“Not since Barney’s closed,” she replies.)</p><p>Of course, we also get another sneak peek at the questionable looks we’ll be served in <em>And Just Like That</em>, in the absence of legendary <em>SATC </em>costume designer Patricia Field, who was <a href="/fashion/article/52877/1/sex-and-the-city-costume-designer-patricia-field-return-reboot-emily-in-paris">apparently too busy</a> with <a href="/film-tv/article/54834/1/official-trailer-emily-in-paris-season-2-lily-collins-jeremy-o-harris-netflix"><em>Emily In Paris </em>season two</a> to work on the reboot.</p>
<p>As you probably already know, Kim Cattrall’s PR exec Samantha Jones won’t be returning in the forthcoming series either, prompting <a href="/film-tv/article/53780/1/tiktok-samantha-jones-dies-kim-cattrall-and-just-like-that-sex-and-the-city">rumours</a> earlier this year that the character would be killed off (spoiler alert: she’s not — she’s just <a href="/film-tv/article/54897/1/how-samantha-jones-has-been-written-out-sex-and-the-city-reboot">jetted off to London</a>). Kristin Davis will return as Samantha, however, alongside Cynthia Nixon (<a href="/film-tv/article/54814/1/will-a-queer-miranda-save-the-satc-reboot">Miranda</a>), Mario Cantone, Evan Handler, David Eigenberg, and Willie Garson, who sadly <a href="/film-tv/article/54255/1/sex-and-the-city-cast-lead-tributes-to-willie-garson-dead-at-57-stanford-blatch">passed away</a> back in September.</p>
<p>The 10-episode series <a href="/film-tv/article/54418/1/the-sex-and-the-city-reboot-finally-has-a-premiere-date-and-just-like-that">will premiere</a> on HBO Max on December 9, with new episodes released weekly until February 2022.

<p>It’s that time of year again: <a href="/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a>’s <a href="/music/article/51271/1/billie-eilish-reflects-on-the-pandemic-in-her-yearly-vanity-fair-interview">annual interview</a> with <em>Vanity Fair </em>has arrived. 2021 marks the fifth iteration of the format, which sees her answer questions on how her life has changed in the year gone by, how many more millions of Instagram followers she’s gained, and how many <a href="/beauty/body/article/52662/1/billie-eilish-has-finally-revealed-her-secret-tattoo">not-so-secret</a> tattoos she’s acquired (three, for the record).</p>
<p>Looking back on her answers from the previous four years from a new, <a href="/beauty/head/article/52238/1/stop-what-you-are-doing-billie-eilish-is-blonde-now">blonde-haired</a> perspective, the 19-year-old singer says that she’s “starting to have an adulthood” in the new interview. “Which is new, for me, and very exciting,” she adds. “I’ve had new experiences, and new people, and lots of love.”</p>
<p>This year, she’s also come to terms with constantly being recognised whenever and wherever she goes out. “My attitude used to be, ‘Well I can’t go out’,” she says. “I used to not even be able to go to a park, or go get food or get coffee. It freaked me out.”</p>
<p>“In the last year, I have been opened up to it,” the <a href="/music/article/52617/1/billie-eilish-returns-to-drop-happier-than-ever-album"><em>Happier Than Ever</em></a> singer goes on. “I really feel grateful for that. Because being able to feel confident, and stepping outside without a hat, and a hood, and glasses, and a mask and jacket… It’s so much better. And you don’t have to live like that. I realised that this year.”</p><p>Of course, the seven-time <a href="/grammys">Grammy</a> winner is still recognised plenty, but adds that getting rid of her <a href="/beauty/head/article/45137/1/billie-eilish-dyes-her-roots-slime-green-and-fans-are-obsessed">slime green roots</a> has helped her to “manage (her) way around people without them noticing” on a daily basis. As does her new, “any thing goes” approach to style, which has seen her swap between her signature oversized look, the Old Hollywood glamour of her <em>Vogue </em><a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/news/article/billie-eilish-vogue-interview">cover</a>, and the more <a href="/fashion/article/53803/1/billie-eilish-doesn-t-care-that-you-think-her-new-style-is-boring">lowkey aesthetic</a> of her <em>Happier Than Ever</em> visuals.</p>
<p>“Literally the thing that I’ve been preaching about since I first started is to wear what you want,” she explains, discussing the public backlash against changing her style. “Dress how you want. Act how you want. Talk how you want. Be how you want. It’s all I’ve ever said.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the annual update, Billie fills us in on some of her recent career highlights, including her latest album, her Disney <a href="/music/article/53743/1/billie-eilish-shares-a-new-teaser-for-happier-than-ever-concert-film-disney-plus">movie</a>, the “terrifying” release of <a href="/music/article/51825/1/billie-eilish-drops-a-new-trailer-for-the-worlds-a-little-blurry-documentary"><em>The World’s A Little Blurry</em></a>, hosting the <a href="/met-ball">Met Gala</a> (and making <a href="/tag/oscar-de-la-renta">Oscar de la Renta</a> <a href="/fashion/article/54126/1/billie-eilish-met-gala-ball-dress-oscar-de-la-renta-ban-fur-aoc-best-looks">promise to stop using fur</a>), and bagging two more Grammys.</p>
<p>However, she says that the “most exciting thing” is the release of <a href="/beauty/body/article/54543/1/billie-eilish-favourite-smell-world-could-soon-be-yours-debut-fragrance-perfume">her debut fragrance</a>, “Eilish”, which she announced earlier this year. “No disrespect to all of the other things I’ve accomplished,” she says. “But that’s very exciting.”</p>

<p>Since 2007, <a href="/tag/alexander-mcqueen">Lee Alexander McQueen</a>’s prestigious <a href="https://sarabandefoundation.org/">Sarabande Foundation</a> has dedicated itself to nurturing the next generation of creative talent – whether by providing scholarships, studio spaces, or creative mentoring to the jewellers, designers, photographers, sculptors, illustrators, and filmmakers under its name. Helmed today by Trino Verkade, who worked closely with McQueen throughout his life and helped set up the creative collective, Sarabande is releasing a new limited edition book, titled <em>Bound</em>. </p><p>Inspired McQueen’s logic-defying creativity – from his SS01 razor clam shell dress to his AW06 antler and lace headdress and SS99 wood-carved prosthetic legs – <em>Bound </em>asks 36 of Sarabande’s past and present creatives to challenge their own creative practices by forsaking their usual mediums for paper. “Paper is the most democratic of materials,” Verkade tells us. “All of the creative disciples work with paper at some point, and we felt it was interesting to challenge an artist or creative to translate their practice and present themselves as an artist in paper.” </p>
<p>The result – described by Verkade as “the closest you can get to experiencing the Sarabande studios” – is a collection of hand-dying, pop-ups, embossing, perforated prints, and pattern cuts created on over 90 unique G.F. Smith papers.</p>	<figure>

<p>Inside <em>Bound</em>, sculptural artist <a href="https://sarabandefoundation.org/blogs/artist/jimmy-junichi-sugiura">Jimmy Sugiura</a> displays a pair of shoes made in paper – photographed to narrate his creation process and completed with ten packs of pattern pieces; photographer <a href="https://sarabandefoundation.org/blogs/artist/elena-andreea-teleaga">Elena-Andreea Teleaga</a> ruminates on scenes from her past by manipulating two photographs with a sheet of corrosive sandpaper; and textile artist <a href="https://sarabandefoundation.org/collections/aurora-pettinari-york">Aurora Pettinari York</a> uses 17th century techniques to creative a hypnotising pop-up sculpture with embroidered words. </p>
<p>“Everyone interpreted or stretched the brief differently, either focusing on the tactility of specialty papers, how they manipulated their work, or how paper reacted to their practice,“ says Verkade, explaining that the book represents a “range of artistic expressions”.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Tucked inside each edition of <em>Bound</em> are two original, handmade works, designed by 19 of the artists and distributed at random throughout <em>Bound</em>’s 100 copies. From a hand-cut sculpture by paper and installation artist <a href="https://www.alicevonmaltzahn.com/">Alice von Maltzahn</a> to an illustration by multidisciplinary artist <a href="https://sarabandefoundation.org/blogs/scholars-artist/izaak-brandt">Izaak Brandt </a>created during one of his performances and a limited-edition photograph of paper nest sculptures by visual sculptor <a href="https://sarabandefoundation.org/blogs/artist/paloma-tendero">Paloma Tendero</a> – the art pieces ensure that each copy remains a distinctive collector’s item with unique art to be inhaled.</p>	<figure>

<p>Sarabande designed the books to exist as its own art piece, not just a documentation of art. Akin to its name, the book is hand-bound in 18 different linen colours and each copy is embossed with four different logo designs (which were also created by Sarabande artists). Outside of that, the books are encased in a traditional Japanese Furoshicki-style wrapping, crafted from hand-embroidered linens which took 105 hours to make. </p>
<p>“The Furoshiki style of binding in a tight wrap represents Sarabande binding a community of artists and creatives together. The embroidery of flames leading into moths signifies the moths’ tenacious flight towards the light, and its ability to constantly change its appearance and develop,” Verkade tells us. “Each book is as unique and individual as the creatives involved,” she adds.</p>	<figure>

<p><em>Bound</em> was originally created to commemorate 100 artists under the Sarabande name and ten years since McQueen’s passing in 2020. After the pandemic delayed the release, however, Sarabande expanded its support to 35 more artists, and the scale of the project grew. “The artists showed such pride and generosity in being included, spending hours creating artworks donated to the foundation, and a trust in our ability to create a meaningful representation of art,” says Verkade. </p>
<p>Staying true to Sarabande’s ethos and McQueen’s legacy, all proceeds from the project will go back towards supporting other emerging artists and designers as the foundation’s family continues to grow. “The cycle of creativity continues, ensuring a future space for those who know what’s possible when you think beyond the bounds,” <em>Bound</em>’s foreword reads.</p>

<p>TikTok it-girl <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@victoriaparis?lang=en">Victoria Paris</a> offers up her own Many Christmas Moments from a monochrome suitcase, flashing the ruby red Cubic backpack too. The 22-year-old New York-based TikToker pulls out a wreath, some Christmas lights, stockings, and a mini Christmas tree, highlighting the joyful, intimate chaos of her festive memories with family. “We were always the psycho family on the block who lit their house up in lights, covered everything in Christmas lights,” she says. “Then all our neighbours would come and see it.”</p>	<figure>

<p>21-year-old <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ssavannahsmithh/?hl=en">Savannah Lee Smith</a>, who plays unfiltered, ruthless, endlessly chic Monet on the 2021 <a href="/film-tv/gallery/29325/6/gossip-girl-reboot">reboot of <em>Gossip Girl</em></a>, doesn’t spend the holidays in the echelons of the Upper East Side. Rather, as she shares with MCM and Dazed, it’s much more intimate, pared back, and wholesome for her favourite holiday.</p>
<p>In the video, where she models an over-sized MCM tee and familiarly initalist black and white cap, Savannah pulls a jar of honey, a candle, and a pen from her MCM mini monochrome backpack. The jar of honey highlights her love of Christmassy scents, while the candle compounds the ‘moody’ winter vibe – “I picked this jar of honey because I love the scents of Thanksgiving and Christmas. I just love the smells of pie, and (when) the house smells like cinnamon and the Christmas tree, apple and honey – I love all that stuff. It just adds to the feeling of Christmas!” she says. Her pen represents writing personal letters, notes and cards to loved ones for the holidays – “we all write Christmas notes and cards for the holidays, but I <em>go in</em>.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Since 1964, Pirelli has produced an annual calendar filled with images of fashion and music’s biggest icons, shot by the likes of <a href="/tag/paolo-roversi">Paolo Roversi</a>, <a href="/tag/tim-walker">Tim Walker</a>, <a href="/tag/peter-lindbergh">Peter Lindbergh</a>, and <a href="/photography/article/28650/1/see-the-first-images-from-annie-lebovitz-s-pirelli-shoot">Annie Leibovitz</a>. Over the last few years, we’ve seen <a href="/fashion/article/36811/1/tim-walker-all-black-cast-2018-pirelli-calendar-edward-enninful-naomi-campbell">Walker</a> and Edward Enninful <a href="/fashion/article/36811/1/tim-walker-all-black-cast-2018-pirelli-calendar-edward-enninful-naomi-campbell">spotlight Black excellence</a> with <a href="/tag/naomi-campbell">Naomi Campbell</a> and <a href="/tag/rupaul">RuPaul</a>; Reversi transform <a href="/tag/rosalia">Rosalía</a>, <a href="/tag/indya-moore">Indya Moore</a>, and <a href="/tag/kristen-stewart">Kristen Stewart</a> into Romeo and Juliet characters; and Lindbergh release a <a href="/artsandculture/article/33882/1/pirelli-reveals-completely-un-retouched-calendar-for-2017">completely unretouched version</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s <a href="/fashion/article/53754/1/a-first-look-at-pirellis-2022-calendar-starring-cher-grimes-and-normani">calendar</a>, titled <em>On the Road</em>, stars some of music’s most recognisable talent: <a href="/tag/cher">Cher</a>, <a href="/tag/grimes">Grimes</a>, <a href="/film-tv/article/45326/1/weirdest-parts-of-the-completely-surreal-cats-trailer-idris-elba-james-corden">Jennifer Hudson</a>, <a href="/tag/normani">Normani</a>, <a href="/tag/rita-ora">Rita Ora</a>, <a href="/music/article/38653/1/meet-the-chinese-rappers-who-are-about-to-cross-over">Bohan Phoenix</a>, <a href="/tag/iggy-pop">Iggy Pop</a>, <a href="/tag/st-vincent">St. Vincent</a>, <a href="/tag/kaliuchis">Kali Uchis</a>, and <a href="/music/article/51605/1/watch-saweetie-and-doja-cat-s-music-video-for-new-track-best-friend">Saweetie</a>.</p>
<p>Shot by musician and photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bryanadams/?hl=en">Bryan Adams</a> at The Palace Theatre in Los Angeles and in Capri, Italy – 2022’s calendar is a celebration of music legends and their lives on tour. Across the images, Normani rests before sound check, Cher poses in a green room, Grimes sings in a recording studio, Saweetie checks out of her hotel, and Iggy Pop is covered in glitter pre-show. </p>
<p></p><p>“It would be very, very hard to encapsulate everything that happens on the road in a couple of days,” said Adams, who has spent over 45 years on tour. “So what I tried to do was to represent some of the aspects of it.” </p>
<p>He continued: “Musicians never really see the front of the building, they see the back of the building, we see the stage door, we see the backstage area, we see the basement of a building… you go from the stage door to the car door to the hotel door to the train door to the bus door… it’s always about travelling.”</p>
<p>Besides marking Pirelli’s 150th anniversary, this year’s calendar celebrates the return to normalcy post-pandemic. “We thought his idea of coupling the world of music with that of the road and travel would be perfect for a calendar that is making its comeback as we seek a gradual return to normality after the pandemic,” said Marco Tronchetti Provera, Pirelli’s executive vice chairman and CEO.</p>
<p>Last year, Pirelli decided to cease the production of its 2021 calendar – instead choosing to donate €100,000 to the vaccine effort. </p>

<p><a href="/tag/demna-gvasalia">Demna Gvasalia</a> is obsessed with the limits of fame and notoriety – his creative direction of <a href="/tag/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a> has rendered the most recognisable women on the planet pretty much faceless – but he has only recently begun to bring celebrity into <a href="/tag/balenciaga">Balenciaga</a>. For a long time he was the antithesis of <a href="/tag/donatella-versace">Donatella Versace</a>, much more likely to send out his collections on a sweep of dour and sullen Victorian-looking models, than he would high-octane supermodels. </p><p>That all changed, however, when <a href="/tag/cardi-b">Cardi B</a> starred front and centre of the house’s September 2020 campaign. Since then, <a href="/tag/naomi-campbell">Naomi Campbell</a>, <a href="/tag/isabelle-huppert">Isabelle Huppert</a>, and <a href="/tag/ella-emhoff">Ella Emhoff</a> have walked and posed for the brand alongside Justin Bieber – who today returns into Gvasalia’s fold, starring in Balenciaga’s latest campaign. Shot wearing a floor-skimming, distended robe-like jacket, and chunky, shin-length gumboots, the popstar dangles a rack of keys from his neck like some kind of doom monk or venal nightporter. </p>
<p>Bieber made his Balenciaga debut last season as the star of Gvasalia’s AW21 campaign shot by Katy Grannan, though he looked a little different in grubby sneakers and slouchy sportswear. In what’s become something of a habit, earlier this week, the Paris-based fashion house deleted every photo from its Instagram, presumably in preparation for the next slew of campaign images following its <a href="/fashion/article/54375/1/balenciaga-ss22-show-special-episode-paris-the-simpsons-demna-gvasalia"><em>The Simpsons </em>venture</a> during fashion week. After all, the label’s next show is set to take place in little over a week, on December 8. Dubbed <em>The Lost Tape</em>, <a href="/tag/balenciaga">Balenciaga</a>’s AW22 collection will debut with a video, accompanied by a look book. Stay tuned for whatever gag Gvasalia is bound to pull then.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">The queer artists making club culture thrive, according to HAAi</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">‘I realised recently that so many artists I really love and who make incredible music, happen to also be queer’</h3>

<p>By now, many people will have had their first <a href="/life-culture/article/53224/1/what-clubbing-in-england-will-look-like-post-covid-according-to-clubs-june-21">post-lockdown clubbing</a> experience – and hopefully it’s been exactly as dreamed of. Spare a thought, though, for the DJs who’d been away from cue buttons, faders, and speaker stacks for so long that the return to heaving venues was a daunting affair. “My first show back was a test festival called Nation Of Gondwana, just outside Berlin,” says Teneil Throssell, better known as HAAi. “Prior to this I was a really confident DJ who rarely second-guessed what I was doing, mostly because I was on the road and totally immersed in that side of music. Having so much time away from it all really shook that up. I feel back in my stride now, but with a new respect for how easily it can all be pulled away.”</p>
<p>HAAi has every reason to be secure in her abilities; a DJ with a Phonox residency on her CV, owner of the coveted Essential Mix of the Year title, and seemingly endless festival billings. Despite coming from a rock, shoegaze, and psych background, the Australia-born producer and DJ pivoted to a punk techno sound after an epiphanous Berghain trip. The music she produces draws from all kinds of reaches of electronic music, courting punishing tech as well as driving melodies, which has found her collaborating with The Chemical Brothers, <a href="/tag/daniel-avery">Daniel Avery</a>, and <a href="/tag/fraser-t-smith">Fraser T Smith</a>. Dropping two EPs over lockdown – a slight shift away from 4x4 music as she felt it was “a bit heartbreaking to make dance music then” – she also spent the time honing her debut album.</p><p>As a queer woman in electronic music, HAAi is quick to hail the <a href="/tag/lgbt">LGBTQ+</a> roots of club culture and applaud the current crop of producers taking four-to-the-floor into bold new territories. “I realised recently that so many artists I love and who make incredible music, happen to also be queer,” she says of the playlist she’s put together compiling some of these musicians. “Seeing all of them in a playlist together made so much sense. I feel artistically there’s usually a real playfulness and experimentation to music by queer artists.” She cites trailblazing London parties like Adonis and Sylvester, as well as the new Body Movements festival, as “a celebration of who we are but also a reaction and protest to political persecution of our out queerness around the world”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Artistically there’s usually a real playfulness and experimentation to music by queer artists” – HAAi</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her choices include <a href="/tag/lsdxoxo">LSDXOXO</a>’s “Sick Bitch” (“I love what he represents for our world. His music and parties feel like a queer utopia as well as taking full ownership of the Black, queer origins of dance music”), as well as “Baby” by Eris Drew, who HAAi describes as “one of the best producers and DJs around – her clever use of samples showcases an encyclopaedic knowledge of dance music”. It also features a production of HAAi’s own, in the form of a remix of <a href="/music/article/50630/1/romy-madley-croft-the-xx-solo-album-lifetime-interview">Romy’s “Lifetime”</a>: “She has a way of capturing emotion and translating it through dance music that I feel is really unique to her.” Elsewhere, she’s spotlighted game changing artists like <a href="/tag/sherelle">Sherelle</a>, <a href="/tag/india-jordan">India Jordan</a>, and Saoirse.</p>
<p>She’s due to go b2b with the latter at <a href="https://www.thewarehouseproject.com/">Warehouse Project</a>’s <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/event/3500587984B00C25?_ga=2.222430683.1943961505.1637278255-1680635310.1636541378">Bicep Weekender</a> on December 4. “I’m excited... and a little nervous,” HAAi admits, “but we have four hours and a lot of common ground in the music we love. She’s a close pal so I’m sure we will have many laughs.” The following week (December 10), she’s due to play a <a href="https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/the-chemical-brothers-dj-set-manchester-10-12-2021/event/35005B2EDB4C581D?_ga=2.213951063.1943961505.1637278255-1680635310.1636541378">set headlined by her collaborators, the Chemical Brothers</a>, with her mentor of sorts (The Blessed Madonna), Overmono, and Special Request also set to spin.

<p>A life lived with purpose, intellectual curiosity, and humility is one that will undoubtedly impact the lives of others after even the most fleeting of encounters. It came as no surprise, then, that following the sudden passing of <a href="/virgil-abloh">Virgil Abloh</a>, individuals from all walks of life began sharing accounts of his humility, kindness, and grace. </p>
<p>The <a href="/off-white">Off-White</a> founder and <a href="/Louis-vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> artistic director, who influenced almost every corner of popular music, fashion, and thought in some shape or form, had been quietly fighting a rare and aggressive cancer following a 2019 diagnosis. His relentless impact over the last two years suddenly made more sense than ever, from establishing <a href="/fashion/article/49784/1/virgil-abloh-announces-1-million-dollar-scholarship-fund-for-black-students">a scholarship fund for Black students</a>, to launching the ‘<a href="/life-culture/article/52295/1/i-support-black-women-feminist-politics-activism-trinice-mcnally-virgil-abloh">I Support Black Women</a>’ campaign with Black feminist activists and scholars. Abloh was acutely aware of his position in fashion as a Black man, going to great lengths to champion young talents like <a href="/Samuel-ross">Samuel Ross</a> and rising British streetwear brand <a href="https://www.crtz.xyz/password">Corteiz</a>.</p><p>As much as his talents and barrier-obliterating accomplishments were mentioned, many tributes pointed towards the tenacity of a man who had, over the course of a decade, worked his way up from an intern at <a href="/fendi">Fendi</a> to helm the biggest fashion house in the world. Working closely with fellow Fendi intern <a href="/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> from 2010, Abloh went on to serve as artistic director for West and Jay-Z’s <em>Watch The Throne </em>album, designing a cover that would win him a Grammy. Soon after came the short-lived ‘artistic experiment’ Pyrex Vision – the first instance in what would be a career that championed, defined, and irrevocably altered youth culture and streetwear, before he founded Off-White in 2013.</p>
<p>To champion streetwear in the circles that he did, and push it to the heights that he did, was a risk that paid off. “In a large part streetwear is seen as cheap. What my goal has been is to add an intellectual layer to it and make it credible,” he explained in a 2016 interview. As somebody who wasn’t a ‘traditionally trained’ fashion designer, taking the uniform of the young and often Black working class and reimagining and repackaging it was no small feat. Abloh blazed a trail for a renaissance that would lead the likes of Balenciaga to follow suit and laser focus on streetwear.</p><blockquote>
<p>"You know who I am most inspired by? That kid that hasn’t had the chance to showcase their brand yet. Those kids motivate the work I do every day. That’s the muse for me: the next generation. And I want my work to inspire people like them” – Virgil Abloh</p>
</blockquote><p>Abloh was youth culture personified, a modern-day archivist who worked almost exclusively off his phones and iPad, who took inspiration from kids on Instagram as much as he did Impressionist artists. A DJ and a director who used his creativity as well as his platform to showcase subgenres from every corner of the world. A Ghanaian-American man who drew inspiration from his own Chicago roots, as well as the Volta region of his ancestors – a delicate balancing act many first-gen immigrants will know.</p>
<p>His life and career leave behind a legacy of risk-taking and forward thinking, of limitless ambition that can take anybody anywhere beyond their wildest dreams – even a 17 year old from Chicago. A legacy of collaboration and homage as well as independent thought, even amidst derision and doubt. Abloh taught us that we can, and should, co-sign ourselves even when nobody recognises your credibility, because soon enough they’ll be following.</p>
<p>Below are some of his most inspiring, powerful quotes. Rest in power Virgil Abloh, 1980 – 2021.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>“Life is collaboration. Where I think art can be sort of misguided is that it propagates this idea of itself as a solo love affair – one person, one idea, no one else involved.”</p>
<p>“Black influence has created a new ecosystem, which can grow and support different types of life that we couldn’t before.”</p><blockquote>
<p>“Life is so short you can't waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do versus knowing what you can do” – Virgil Abloh</p>

<p>“Any person you can cite: Steve Jobs, Karl Lagerfeld, Michael Jordan – they are not common names because they did it nine-to-five.

<p>As we grapple to make sense of the sudden and devestating loss of <a href="/tag/virgil-abloh">Virgil Abloh</a>, <a href="/tag/louis-vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a> has announced its SS22 runway will be a tribute to its late creative director. Having been scheduled to take place in Miami for the best part of six months, the show will go ahead as planned, presenting Abloh’s final collection for the French fashion house. </p>
<p>“Virgil Was Here” will pay tribute to the life and legacy of the designer, announced across social media with a two-minute film of a young boy cycling through Miami, zooming along its coast, until he reaches a hot air balloon and soars into the sky. Just four days ago, Abloh posted a teaser of the show on Instagram with “Miami, I have an idea…” – that he was working so close to his death is testament to Abloh’s tenacity and unwavering drive to create. </p><p>Fellow industry titans have taken to social media to express their shock and loss surrounding the news of Abloh’s passing, since the designer decided to keep his cancer diagnosis a secret. <a href="/tag/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> dedicated his latest Sunday Service installment to his friend, sharing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5geHf5807ks">livestream</a> of a choral rendition of Adele’s “Easy On Me”.</p>
<p><a href="/music/article/44732/1/frank-ocean-john-waters-viviane-sassen-arca-adwoa-aboah-amandla-stenberg">Frank Ocean</a>, too, shared a handful of his memories of the designer. “In 2018, I called V and asked him how it was possible to play hundreds of shows a year and do numerous fashion collections, and be a father and a husband and return EVERYONE’s texts with enthusiasm and emojis and encouragement, and seemingly… with ease,” wrote Ocean. ““The gist of his response was that he was interested in living, and living to the maximum extent of his level… which proved to be impossible today because he was BEYOND. I know grief is love that you don’t get to express, so this is an attempt at expressing it. Love you V. You’re a hero.”</p>
<p>It’s not just famous people, though. Over the past few days, newsfeeds have been flooded with tributes, with young, fairly unknown creatives sharing the heartfelt and often inspiring DMs that Abloh would send them. Intimate records of the designer’s ability to look beyond himself and catalyse future generations of creatives. While details on the show remain sparse, viewers can tune into the livestream at 22:30 GMT or 17:30 ET across Louis Vuitton’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5q0PIKGr2lGOsiT14AlEYg">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.instagram.com/louisvuitton">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://louisvuitton.com/">website</a>.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<h1 class="fl-title">Join a London vigil marking 40 years since the discovery of AIDS</h1>

<p>It’s been four decades since the first cases of what later became known as <a href="/aids">AIDS</a> were officially reported. In June 1981 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA noted that five gay men aged between 29 and 36 years of age passed away in three different hospitals in LA, marking the first of 36 million people who would later be taken by HIV/AIDS. </p>
<p>Though science has triumphed and people now live long and healthy lives with HIV, in the fifteen years between the onset of AIDS and the discovery of effective antiretroviral therapy, loss, rage, and resilience became unwelcome bedfellows within the queer community. And yet despite the arrival of groundbreaking, long-acting injections and vaccines for HIV, which scientists are beginning to trial, <a href="/music/article/53669/1/victoria-monet-replace-dababys-verse-homophobic-comments-dua-lipa-levitating">we have yet to unlearn</a> much of the stigma and discrimination from that period. Not to mention that the pandemic is still unfurling in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. </p><p>To commemorate the lives lost, the progress made, and that yet to be achieved, <a href="/beauty/tag/mac">MAC</a> and fashion designer <a href="/tag/gareth-pugh">Gareth Pugh</a> are holding a candlelit vigil on Carnaby Street on World Aids Day (this Wednesday, December 1). From 5pm, a gospel choir will congregate outside the MAC store, joined by Professor Jane Anderson CBE, chair of the National AIDS Trust, who will deliver a speech to those in attendance.</p>
<p>The vigil will be led by MAC VIVA Glam, the beauty brand’s charitable arm which has raised more than $500,000,000 for HIV/AIDS organisations since its inceptoin in 1994. The sale of MAC VIVA Glam lip products, which is based on a 100 per cent giving model, has funded more than 1,800 organizations around the globe and has seen a score of celebrities to put their names to lipsticks, glosses, and pencils. <a href="/tag/rupaul">RuPaul</a> was the first, followed by the likes of <a href="/tag/rihanna">Rihanna</a>, <a href="/tag/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a>, <a href="/tag/miley-cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>, <a href="/tag/lady-gaga">Lady Gaga</a>, <a href="/tag/boy-george">Boy George</a>, <a href="/tag/mary-j-blige">Mary J Blige</a>, and <a href="/tag/debbie-harry">Debbie Harry</a>. </p>
<p>Head down to Carnaby Street at 5PM (GMT) this World Aids Day to join in on the remembrance.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>When she’s not releasing <a href="https://www.savagex.co.uk/shop/tied-up-tartan-pj-pants-sq2149678-10303-12478045">ass-less pyjamas</a>, perpetually <a href="/music/article/54714/1/rihanna-kind-of-returns-to-music-vinyl-reissue-merch">delaying her album drop</a>, or gracing the cover of Dazed <a href="/fashion/article/54523/1/win-nft-jawara-alleyne-blunt-dress-worn-by-rihanna-brand-new-vision">dressed as a giant spliff</a>, <a href="/tag/rihanna">Rihanna</a> is being named ‘national hero’ of her native country and newly-declared republic, Barbados.</p>
<p>The Bridgetown-born megastar was crowned with the title on Tuesday (November 30) after the island officially cut ties with Queen Elizabeth II, ending nearly 400 years of British rule, and swore in its first president, Sandra Mason.</p>
<p>Rihanna has been an ambassador for Barbados since 2018, and is the country’s 11th national hero, but only the second woman to receive the title, becoming The Right Honourable Robyn Rihanna Fenty during a historic ceremony.</p><p>Presenting the award, Prime Minister Mia Motley said: “On behalf of a grateful nation, but an even prouder people, we therefore present to you, the designee, for national hero of Barbados, ambassador Robyn Rihanna Fenty. May you continue to shine like a diamond.”</p>
<p>Barbados follows other Caribbean nations who have removed Queen Elizabeth as their head of state, such as Guyana which became a republic in 1970, Trinidad and Tobago (1976), and Dominica (1978). The Queen remains head of state in several others including Jamaica, Grenada, The Bahamas, Belize, and St Lucia.</p>
<p>“Republic Barbados has set sail on her maiden voyage,” Mason said in her presidential inauguration speech, recognising the “complex, fractured and turbulent world” it would need to navigate.</p>
