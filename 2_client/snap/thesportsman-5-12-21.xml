<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Lewis Hamilton has won a breathless Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The Mercedes man saw off the challenge of rival Max Verstappen in a race littered with contentious moments and white-knuckle excitement. The Driver‚Äôs Championship will now be settled in Abu Dhabi, as both drivers stand on 396.5 points.</p> <p>With crucial Driver‚Äôs Championship points at stake, and Verstappen able to all but take the title going into the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi, this was always likely to be a bitter battle. But nobody could have foreseen the amount of controversial flashpoints this race was able to provide. </p> <p>The first controversy arrived when an 11th lap crash that took Mick Schumacher out of the race gave Verstappen essentially a free tyre change. Hamilton was furious, having only just pitted himself. The race was suspended in order to repair the crash barriers that Schumacher‚Äôs car had struck. Hamilton bitterly disputed the stoppage, claiming the wall was not damaged by the crash. </p> <p>The restart is where utter chaos reigned, as Verstappen pushed Hamilton‚Äôs Mercedes wide and then left the track to overtake him. Alpine‚Äôs Esteban Ocon seized the opportunity to then take a brief lead. Meanwhile, another crash occurred further back involving Sergio Perez and Nikita Mazepin. During the resultant stoppage, race director Michael Masi took the unusual step of negotiating with Red Bull, offering Verstappen P3 and threatening a full investigation if he were to refuse. After a long deliberation, the Red Bull team accepted and this most unusual race got its third start of the evening.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What a race! What drama!<br><br>Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton will go to the Abu Dhabi decider LEVEL ON POINTS üò≥<br><br>You couldn&#39;t make this up, honestly üèÅ<br><br>üì∫ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SaudiArabianGP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SaudiArabianGP</a> reaction on Sky Sports F1<a href="https://t.co/npLrZQSSCd">pic.twitter.com/npLrZQSSCd</a></p>&mdash; Sky Sports News (@SkySportsNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsNews/status/1467580808189857796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>Stunningly, Verstappen attacked Hamilton on the inside and immediately re-took first position from the restart. There was more heart-stopping action to be had, as Hamilton looked to take the outside of the Dutchman and there was contact between the cars as Max won the battle. ‚ÄúThis guy is ******* crazy man‚Äù, remarked Hamilton on his radio.</p> <p>An infringement led to Verstappen being ordered to give first place back to Hamilton, and even this routine changeover ended up causing a ruckus that will be debated in the coming days. The Red Bull driver slowed down, but kept his car central on the track and braked dramatically. Hamilton smashed into the back of his bitter rival, damaging his front wing. At the second attempt, Max did give up the place, but immediately retook his lead with an unbelievable move.</p> <p>The Brit re-took the lead on the 44th lap, and did not relinquish it from there, going on to win an utterly bonkers race. With Verstappen coming second, the final race of the season is tensely-poised. Both drivers will go into the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on 369.5 points. The Red Bull man leads by virtue of more race wins this term. This most brutal of title battles is sure to deliver more drama and controversy as it approaches its final corner.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Pressure Mounts On Brendan Rodgers As Aston Villa Beat Leicester City 2-1</title>

<description>The Foxes fell foul of the same old frailties at Villa Park.</description>
<dc:creator>Joey Mills</dc:creator>
<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers was clearly frustrated, as he stood on the touchline and watched his side make the same old mistakes. Set-piece frailties and defensive errors characterised his side‚Äôs 2-1 loss to Aston Villa, and this display did little to dispel talk that the Foxes are going backwards.</p> <p>The first period was an entertaining affair from a neutral standpoint, with both teams going about their work with attacking intent. Leicester have often been slow-starters this season, but the galvanising presence of Patson Daka saw them try and impose themselves early. The Zambia international stung the palms of Emiliano Martinez with an early effort, and left Tyrone Mings standing to get another shot away. </p> <p>It was only a matter of time before Daka‚Äôs energetic presence helped the Foxes strike gold, and he showed tremendous strength under pressure to play in Harvey Barnes. The 23-year-old had the confidence to slow play down, and take the time to place a pass into Kasper Schmeichel‚Äôs net. </p> <p>Their lead had barely been tabulated on the scoreboard when Aston Villa answered. A free kick was floated into the Leicester box, and a bout of head-tennis ended with Matty Cash nodding the ball to Emi Buendia. The ex-Norwich man aimed a header towards goal and Ezri Konsa got the slightest of touches to score the equaliser. The away team protested vehemently, and the goal was checked for a possible offside, but was correctly given.</p> <p>There would be more controversy surrounding an apparent goal just before half time. Jacob Ramsey had appeared to put Villa 2-1 up, seizing on a Schmeichel spillage from a Cash cross. The Dane rolled around holding his gloved hand, and upon a VAR check it became clear he had placed his hand on the ball when Ramsey struck it. Despite his intervention being timed at just 1/12th of a second, it was decided the goalkeeper had brought the ball under control, and by the current laws the goal could not stand.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HALF-TIME Aston Villa 1-1 Leicester<br><br>Harvey Barnes&#39; clever finish is cancelled out by Ezri Konsa&#39;s faint touch on Emiliano Buendia&#39;s header<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AVLLEI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AVLLEI</a> <a href="https://t.co/ATbEvYn5Zn">pic.twitter.com/ATbEvYn5Zn</a></p>&mdash; Premier League (@premierleague) <a href="https://twitter.com/premierleague/status/1467544198442323978?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>Villa came out for the second half fired-up, perhaps by a sense of injustice. Ollie Watkins played a slick give-and-go with Ramsey before having a shot blocked. Then Konsa secured his brace, and there was no controversy over this one. A looping cross came over and Caglar Soyuncu was not awake to the presence of the former Brentford defender, who powered a header in at Schmeichel‚Äôs near post. The keeper should have done better, but it was impressive work from the home side nonetheless.</p> <p>The Foxes began to show signs of life, with James Maddison sending a cleanly-hit effort just over from outside the box. Brendan Rodgers threw Jamie Vardy on to try and give his side some attacking verve, and Leicester were temporarily spurred into life. Aston Villa had a prime chance to kill the game off on the counter, when a superb Buendia run opened up the away team. An advantage played on a crunching foul on Buendia saw the ball wind up with John McGinn, and Ramsey really should have done better with the Scotsman‚Äôs pass into the box. The 20-year-old had time, but sent his effort high over the bar.</p> <p>The Foxes still posed some danger though. A looping Barnes header drew an absolutely superb stop from Martinez. Ultimately, it was not enough to overcome their problems, many of which had been of their own making. Leicester‚Äôs ailing defensive record, and organisational failures at set-pieces, continue to be a thorn in the side of Rodgers‚Äô team.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Kerr And Attention: Chelsea Beat Arsenal To Win Women's FA Cup Final At Wembley</title>

<description>Sam Kerr's brace, including an incredible chip, seals the FA Cup for superb Chelsea.</description>
<dc:creator>Joey Mills</dc:creator>
<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Chelsea are the winners of the Women‚Äôs FA Cup, after a thoroughly dominant display at Wembley. Revenge was on the minds of the west London club, after Arsenal had beaten the reigning WSL champions 3-2 on the opening day of the season. </p> <p>The build-up had centred upon the supposedly spiky relationship between the managers, with Jonas Eidevall and Emma Hayes reportedly having little time for one another. Thankfully, it was the football that did the talking in front of a bumper Wembley crowd that demonstrated an all-time high appetite for the women‚Äôs game. As recently as 2013, the Women‚Äôs FA Cup Final was being played out in front of 5,000 fans at the Keepmoat Stadium. Now, it is a traditional highlight of the Wembley calendar, with today‚Äôs game being watched by over 40,000 spectators. Proof, if needed, that women‚Äôs football is thriving in England. </p> <p>The first half was perhaps the most one-sided 45 minutes you‚Äôre likely to see in a major final. However, Chelsea could only score a single goal for all their chances. Fran Kirby opened the scoring in the third minute, the third time a goal has arrived at that point in the FA Cup final. The Blues‚Äô relentless pressing caused Arsenal problems in possession, and they struggled to get into a passing rhythm early on.</p> <p>Kirby had a taste for goals, and continued to pepper Manuela Zinsberger‚Äôs goal. A through ball saw the England star force a good save from the Arsenal keeper, but she was adjudged offside. Zinsberger then went full stretch when Kirby tried to bend one in from the edge of the box. Melanie Leupolz‚Äôs wonderful control saw her tee up Kirby for yet another chance, which was blocked by Jennifer Beattie.</p> <p>The finest chance of a Chelsea-dominated half would fall to Sam Kerr, who out-muscled Lotte Wubben-Moy before cannoning her shot off the crossbar. The Australia international should have had a penalty at one point, after appearing to be clearly brought down in the box. Arsenal would also lament the lack of VAR being employed in the game, when Beth Mead‚Äôs intelligent run was blocked by the arm of Erin Cuthbert in the box. It‚Äôs a shame that such a showpiece game was not afforded the same officiating technology that other such occasions enjoy.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üîµ <a href="https://twitter.com/samkerr1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@samkerr1</a> scores at Wembley!<a href="https://twitter.com/ChelseaFCW?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ChelseaFCW</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WomensFACupFinal?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WomensFACupFinal</a> <a href="https://t.co/JiijaFaaxs">pic.twitter.com/JiijaFaaxs</a></p>&mdash; Vitality Women&#39;s FA Cup (@VitalityWFACup) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalityWFACup/status/1467514588983746561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>If a 1-0 half time scoreline did Chelsea a disservice, they soon re-asserted their dominance after the break. Sam Kerr picked the ball up in a wide left position, before cutting inside brilliantly. The forward hit a precise finish between the legs of Wubben-Moy and past a stranded Zinsberger.</p> <p>The incredible Australian would put the most sublime of exclamation marks on an utterly spotless Chelsea display with a quarter of an hour left on the clock. Carrying the ball into the right half-space, Kerr strode into the box and hit an unbelievable dinked chip over Zinsberger and into the net. The passionate celebrations of Chelsea manager Emma Hayes said it all, as her side had sealed the win in the most outstanding fashion.</p> <p>A replay of the 2018 final, today‚Äôs game went much the same way as that game. The score was 3-1 on that occasion, and Chelsea went one better by keeping a deserved clean sheet and walking out 3-0 winners today. With Arsenal still top of the WSL, a point clear of Chelsea, today will not be the last time these two sides battle for major honours this term.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>Remembering the times 'The Rocket' kept us entertained away from the table</description>

<category>Snooker</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>As it's snooker legend Ronnie O'Sullivan's 46th birthday, we thought we'd take a look back at the times 'the Rocket' entertained us away from the table. Here are our favourite moments from the iconic cueman across his glittering career so far.... </p> <h2 class="editorH3">When Ronnie Refused To Complete A 147</h2> <p>Ronnie O'Sullivan collects 147s like other people collect stamps. However, he could have bagged a whole lot more had it not been for his disdain for the meagre rewards that he perceives to come with the feat.</p> <p>In February 2016, Ronnie O'Sullivan refused to complete a 147 at the Welsh Open after discovering his prize would have been 'only' ¬£10,000. O'Sullivan was leading Barry Pinches 3-1 and had scored just 40 in the fifth frame when he asked the referee what he would win were he to score 147. When informed of the ‚Äòpaltry‚Äô 10k, he continued the red-black sequence until he snidely chose to pot the pink after the penultimate red, becoming a real b*stard on the ball. O'Sullivan then cleared the rest of the table for a break of 146, a single point off the formerly obtainable maximum.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/GettyImages-672932536jpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>‚ÄúI could have got on the black and possibly made a 147,‚Äù was his flippant, devil-may-care response.</p> <p>"I knew it was 10 grand and I just thought that's a bit too cheap really. To make a maxi, it's such a massive achievement and if they're going to pay us 10 grand, I think it's worth a bit more than that.</p> <p>"Once the prize goes up a bit, I'll go for the 147. A 146 is just as good.‚Äù</p> <p>One year later he was up to his old tricks again but this time the referee stepped him, spoke to his sensitive side and implored him to clear up the final colour ‚Äúfor the fans‚Äù. Ronnie duly did.</p> <h2 class="editorH3">When Ronnie Tried His Hand At Pig Farming</h2> <p>O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs disdain for the game which made his name has perpetually reared its head. One such incident, saw Ronnie turn his back on the snooker to rear pigs instead. Fed up with the bureaucracy of the sport he has perfected better than any other, the then world champion swapped the Crucible for cows and bulls, taking on unpaid labourer work down on a farm in Essex in 2013.</p> <p>"The farm has got sheep, pigs, cows, goats, chickens, horses and I've been getting the green wellies on," he told the press at the time of his decision, ‚Äú"I've been cleaning out stables and pig sties, taking down fences, putting rubbish into barrels and clearing mud.</p> <p>"It has been mainly manual work, also getting big bales of hay in to feed the animals. I was getting so bored I had to do something, and needed a goal to get out of bed in the morning.</p> <p>"I didn't want stress, as that was what made me pull out of snooker, so I decided to go and do something unpaid.</p> <p>"I get there about 8am, do my three or four-mile run first because it is right in the forest, then come back and do about six hours‚Äô work.</p> <p>"It has been kind of the opposite to what I was going through in snooker and I am really enjoying it."</p> <p> </p> <h2 class="editorH3">When Ronnie Hustled Pool-Playing Americans</h2> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/RocketRonnie12of23jpg.jpg" alt="Credit: North One"> <figcaption>Credit: North One</figcaption> </figure> <p>O'Sullivan and his chief chum sports broadcaster Matt Smith went west to go undercover in a History Channel exclusive series. With snooker far, far from being the biggest sport in the States, O‚ÄôSullivan could ‚Äòhustle‚Äô almost anonymously, investigating America‚Äôs 300 year love affair with snooker‚Äôs sister; the game of pool. </p> <p>The duo‚Äôs job was to ‚Äòhunt down America‚Äôs most notorious pool hustlers while meeting a few characters along the way‚Äô and then attempt to target local pool shark legends in the hope ‚Äòthey can beat them at their own game, in their own backyard‚Äô, providing an entertaining adventure that showed the world-beater both in and out of his comfort zone. Though for Brits there might be the continuous collective cringe at the mispronunciation ‚Äòsnucker‚Äô and bewildered Yanks wondering who ‚ÄòJohnny O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äô actually is, the viewer is taken around both the infamous and unheralded, dark, dingy pool halls of the States, watching Ronnie face off against greats of the game like Earl ‚ÄòThe Pearl‚Äô Strickland (‚ÄúI‚Äôm one of the greatest athletes that‚Äôs ever been born!‚Äù),  ‚ÄòThe Scorpion‚Äô, and ‚ÄòThe Black Widow‚Äô who literally ‚Äòbreaks balls for a living‚Äô.</p> <p> </p> <h2 class="editorH3">When Ronnie Tried VR For The First Time</h2> <figure class="op-interactive"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OMceVbo3Tm4"></iframe> </figure> <p>Snooker didn‚Äôt translate quite as well as he‚Äôd hope outside of The Matrix. In 2016, O‚ÄôSullivan was given the opportunity to leap into the future, getting all equipped up with HTC Vive‚Äôs virtual reality mask to play the game he‚Äôs been practicing since the age of seven. Well, who else better to test the tech? Unfortunately, it was a tough task for the snooker stud, who failed to get to the grips with the concept that ‚Äòthere was no table‚Äô, and promptly fell over.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>Some United stars look ideally suited to the German's philosophy, but some look set to struggle.</description>
<dc:creator>Joey Mills</dc:creator>
<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Ralf Rangnick will take charge of his first game as Manchester United interim manager on Sunday, when his new side welcome Crystal Palace to Old Trafford. Most expect the German to implement a new, more rigid tactical plan at a club that struggled for a clear identity under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. This will require United‚Äôs players to endure a period of adjustment and some will take to this better than others. Here is a look at how life under Rangnick may suit some of United‚Äôs stars, who may benefit, and who may struggle under the new regime.</p> <p><u>Winners</u></p> <p><strong>Donny van de Beek</strong></p> <p>The Netherlands international has endured a difficult time since heading to Old Trafford in the summer of 2020. His signing was greeted with much fanfare at the time, but it soon became clear that he was signed due to United‚Äôs inability to secure targets like Jadon Sancho and Jack Grealish, rather than because Solskjaer wanted him.</p> <p>Donny can find a way back under Rangnick, though. The former RB Leipzig boss favours short passes in central midfield, often playing a tight three in that area. Van de Beek is perhaps United‚Äôs best mover of the ball in tight spaces, and would thrive in such a system. The ex-Ajax midfielder has languished behind Bruno Fernandes in the pecking order, but Rangnick‚Äôs appointment could see him line up alongside the Portugal international.</p> <p><strong>Amad Diallo</strong></p> <p>The 19-year-old was on the verge of a loan move during the summer, before an injury saw a year-long switch to Feyenoord collapse. But the former Atalanta winger could be tailor-made for his new coach. </p> <p>Rangnick famously prefers signing and developing players under the age of 23 over relying on more experienced stars, and the German is sure to relish shaping Amad‚Äôs raw talent. The Ivorian has looked brave and exciting during his brief cameos in red, and a chance to work under Rangnick could be the spark that ignites a promising career.</p> <p><strong>Fred</strong></p> <p>The maligned midfielder is already enjoying an uptick in form after thriving during Michael Carrick‚Äôs three-game stewardship. A union with the ‚ÄúGodfather of the Gegenpress‚Äù could be a match made in heaven for a player who leads United‚Äôs midfield in the pressing stats.</p> <p>The tight midfield three mentioned earlier would offer Fred some positional protection, as his tendency to abandon his post has been costly at times. He is never likely to be the orthodox holding midfielder United desperately seek, but his energy and ability to break up play could mesh well with Rangnick‚Äôs approach.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/2019-03-30_Fuball_Mnner_1_Bundesliga_RB_Leipzig_-_Hertha_BSC_StP_3705_LR10_by_Steprojpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p><u>Losers</u></p> <p><strong>Cristiano Ronaldo</strong></p> <p>The talismanic forward has been the elephant in the room surrounding Rangnick‚Äôs appointment. The ultimate pressing manager signing for a team with the world‚Äôs best forward who never presses. The former Schalke manager was quick to laugh off this assertion in his press conference, but it is hard to shake the idea this is an ill fit.</p> <p>Ronaldo has been typically effective in front of goal since joining, netting 12 goals in his 16 appearances since his return. But you do wonder if Rangnick would be so quick to stick with him were he not one of the most high-profile men to ever play the game. The energetic Edinson Cavani and the exuberant Mason Greenwood would both appear to be better fits for a team likely to defend from the front. Ronaldo is still the best penalty box finisher in the world, so it will be interesting to see how the interim manager chooses to accommodate that.</p> <p><strong>Nemanja Matic</strong></p> <p>Matic‚Äôs experience and composure have often settled a disastrous United midfield this term, but even the most sympathetic observer would class the Serbian as past his best. He is most effective as a defensive screen in front of the back four, and has often found himself overrun by quicker players in recent times.</p> <p>While he is defensively sound and reads the game well, what Matic does not offer is pressing. This is a key tenet of the Rangnick philosophy. At the age of 33, the midfielder is also a decade removed from the German‚Äôs favoured age range for his players.</p> <p><strong>Luke Shaw</strong></p> <p>This one comes straight from the horse's mouth. Speaking in September 2020, Rangnick said of the England international, ‚ÄúThey could do with a left-back, I know they have Luke Shaw but I'm not so sure if he's still on the same kind of level you need for a club like Manchester United.‚Äù</p> <p>Shaw would go on to enjoy the season of his career for club and country, but has struggled for form this campaign. At 26 he has time on his side, and enough pace to fit into Rangnick‚Äôs style of play. But he also has a very able competitor for his spot in Alex Telles, and a job on his hands to try and change his new manager‚Äôs mind.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21337091.2">Man Utd are 3/5 to beat Crystal Palace with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The Women‚Äôs Super League‚Äôs top-two sides square off on Sunday afternoon as Chelsea and Arsenal meet in the delayed 50th Women‚Äôs FA Cup final.</p> <p>Due to Covid-19, last season's competition was postponed into the new campaign with the second round being delayed from January 4th to April 4th 2021 and the quarter-finals taking place after the start of the 2021/22 season.</p> <p>The game marks 100 years to the day since the Football Association decided football was "quite unsuitable for females" and outlawed the women‚Äôs game - a ban that lasted for half a century, despite the fact that at the end of the First World War matches had attracted crowds of more than 50,000 spectators.</p> <p>Given the historic landmark, we‚Äôve been treated to a titanic tussle for English football‚Äôs most celebrated domestic trophy. WSL table-toppers Arsenal, who are by far the most successful side in this competition with 15 wins, have been simply scintillating this season and are currently unbeaten after eight league games, having scored 26 and conceded just three. </p> <p>The Blues sit just a solitary point below Jonas Eidevall‚Äôs Gunners and their only defeat this season came at the hands of this weekend‚Äôs opponents on the opening day of the season. Should Emma Hayes‚Äô emerge victorious, they would clinch a domestic treble from a sublime 2020/21 campaign that also saw them clench the WSL title and League Cup, as well as reach a Champion League final in May. Hayes can also become the first female manager to win three FA Cups, having led her side to glory against Notts County in 2015 and Arsenal in 2018.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/EmmaHayesjpg.jpg" alt="Emma Hayes "> <figcaption>Emma Hayes </figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Where: </strong>Wembley Stadium</p> <p><strong>When:</strong> Sunday, 2pm</p> <p><strong>How To Watch: </strong>BBC One, BT Sport 1</p> <p><strong>What They Say:</strong></p> <p><u>Chelsea manager Emma Hayes:</u></p> <p>‚ÄúIt will be a great final with two great teams and quality on show. It‚Äôs a great venue and, of course, I want to win but this game is about something much bigger.</p> <p>‚ÄúThis is great for those who have been involved in the women‚Äôs game from the onset. This is the showpiece event. It‚Äôs two fabulous teams vying to win, but the FA Cup is about the history and it‚Äôs about making more history.‚Äù</p> <p><u>Arsenal manager Jonas Eidevall:</u></p> <p>‚ÄúI think when we look back to where we were at before that game [season opener vs Chelsea] and during that game, I think we have developed drastically and we have much, much more maturity and have lived through a lot of experience and have learned from that.</p> <p>‚ÄúBoth in defence and in offence I think we have developed ‚Äì and so have Chelsea, though. I‚Äôm excited and looking forward to the game.‚Äù</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21383266.2">Arsenal are 12/5 to lift the FA Cup with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The Brazilian has scored 46% of the Yorkshire outfit's Premier League goals this season </description>

<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>When things haven‚Äôt been going great for Leeds United in the Premier League this season, they have been able to rely on Raphinha. The tricky winger has had to almost carry the attacking burden alone at Elland Road with striker Patrick Bamford being absent for over two months through injury.</p> <p>The Brazilian scored his sixth league goal of the campaign when he converted a late match-winning penalty against Crystal Palace on Tuesday night. His impact on the team cannot be overstated because Leeds have only managed to score 13 times in the league which means that Raphinha has scored 46% of the Yorkshire outfit‚Äôs goals. They simply cannot afford for him to suffer an injury in the upcoming winter period in which they have seven games coming thick and fast. Marcelo Bielsa has had to try and adapt his philosophy to cope without Bamford and key defender Luke Ayling over the last couple of months and Raphinha, who is often the creator of goals in the side, has had to step into the spotlight in Bamford‚Äôs absence.</p> <p>It has been clear for weeks that Leeds have looked short up top, something that is unforgiving in this challenging division, and while Raphinha has stepped up to the plate, he has to be supported by his fellow attacking players, especially in the next seven matches. On a positive note, Bamford recently featured for Leeds in an under-23s game in the next step of his return to match action and there is hope that he will be available to Bielsa sooner rather than later. </p> <p>This will be a huge boost for Raphinha as it can allow him to return to his problematic role down the right, tormenting full-backs and creating golden opportunities for Leeds‚Äô star striker to put away. The duo are a formidable force on their day and they are the two Leeds players who are the most synchronised with how they play and when Bamford comes back into the fold, we will start to see Raphinha creating a lot more as well as getting on the scoresheet, which will definitely see an upturn in converted chances at Elland Road.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Keeping your cool in the last minute of the game üßä<br><br>Raphinha made no mistake from the spot to earn Leeds three points üëè<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PLonPrime?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PLonPrime</a> <a href="https://t.co/7Ua1gQTWzI">pic.twitter.com/7Ua1gQTWzI</a></p>&mdash; Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) <a href="https://twitter.com/primevideosport/status/1465995590366478338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>The Brazilian is already a cult figure in Leeds, and the supporters could not be more grateful for his leadership at the front of the pitch this term. The Sportsman spoke to Leeds fans about the impact the 24-year-old has had this season. Martin Riley of <a href="https://twitter.com/AllLeedsTV">All Leeds TV</a> said: [Leeds would be] definitely lower in the table, he has scored so many important goals, he‚Äôs our top scorer and has a heavy burden on him with Patrick Bamford being out for so long.‚Äù</p> <p>Speaking about what the return of Bamford will mean for the Brazilian, Thomas Bradley of <a href="https://twitter.com/Radebe_Leeds">I‚Äôd Radabe Leeds</a> said: ‚ÄúBamford's return will be good for Raphinha in relation to someone getting on the end of his creativity on a more frequent basis. Bamford's return is also good for the rest of the team and the fans. He's a fan favourite now and his presence has been missed.‚Äù</p> <p>There is no doubting the gargantuan effect these two players combining on the pitch will have on Leeds‚Äô goal tally as Bamford scored 17 last year and Raphinha grabbed nine assists, and their on-field partnership is sure to be fruitful once again when the pair are reunited. </p> <p>The only worrying thing for Leeds fans is that the winger has excelled in a struggling team in recent months, and that will catch the eye of many teams looking to bolster their squads in the upcoming transfer windows. But for now, Raphinha seems happy where he is, playing excellent football and winning Leeds matches, and for them, that is all that matters.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/market-group/18672427.2">Leeds are 19/20 to beat Brentford with Betfred*</a></p> <p>* <em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Zhao Xintong Has Graduated From Wildcard Menace To Triple Crown Title Contender</title>

<description>Zhao beat Barry Hawkins 6-1 to book his place in the UK Championship final </description>
<dc:creator>Hector Nunns</dc:creator>
<category>Snooker</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Zhao Xintong of China will take on Belgium‚Äôs Luca Brecel in the final of the Cazoo UK Championship on Sunday at the York Barbican in a showpiece that has a real freshness and ‚Äònext generation‚Äô feel about it with two young players chasing a huge career breakthrough. </p> <p>Brecel, 26, <a href="https://www.thesportsman.com/articles/belgium-s-luca-brecel-makes-history-by-reaching-uk-championship-final">performed spectacularly earlier on Saturday</a>, making four century breaks and another of 97 to beat Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan‚Äôs quarter-final conqueror Kyren Wilson. And he was later joined by the 24-year-old Zhao, who confidently dispatched former World Championship runner-up Barry Hawkins 6-1 with a century and five other breaks over 70. </p> <p>Every bit as talented and fluent as those viewed as the most attractive players to watch over the years such as Jimmy White, Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan and Judd Trump, Zhao is in fact Brecel‚Äôs favourite to watch if he is sitting in a hotel room killing time between his own matches. The aggression and attacking flair has always been there. It has been slightly reined in ‚Äì but not much. </p> <p>Of the next Chinese wave following on behind trailblazer and mentor Ding Junhui, Zhao who comes from Xi‚Äôan had become in some ways the forgotten man behind Masters champion Yan Bingtao and Zhou Yuelong. But the three really come as a package, also practising together at the same Sheffield Academy, and until not too long ago sharing accommodation. </p> <p>After his win over Hawkins to propel him into a first career final of any kind, Zhao, who made a century and five other breaks over 70, said: ‚ÄúI am very happy right now, I don‚Äôt have the words to describe it. I was nervous going out there at the start. </p> <p>‚ÄúBeating John Higgins earlier in the tournament was important, I could have lost that one and it gave me a lot of confidence and I played a lot better yesterday and today. It is good that legends are saying nice things about me ‚Äì they are my teachers now! Luca played perfectly today and is a very good player, I think we can make a beautiful game.‚Äù </p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">He&#39;s done it!<br><br>Zhao Xintong has beaten Barry Hawkins 6-1 to reach his maiden ranking final üëè<a href="https://twitter.com/WwwXintongzhao?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WwwXintongzhao</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CazooUKChampionship?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CazooUKChampionship</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/CazooUK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CazooUK</a> <a href="https://t.co/qFHoPnDIFy">pic.twitter.com/qFHoPnDIFy</a></p>&mdash; World Snooker Tour (@WeAreWST) <a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreWST/status/1467242096528666629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>His win puts him provisionally just into the top 16 for January‚Äôs elite Masters tournament, but Brecel lurks just a single place behind him. And should the Belgian win on Sunday, he would claim not only a first UK title but also the final Masters spot also at Zhao‚Äôs expense. </p> <p>Zhao first came to wider attention back in 2012 as a 15-year-old amateur, handed a wildcard for the International Championship in ‚ÄòPanda country‚Äô in Chengdu where he held his nerve superbly to beat former world champion Ken Doherty 6-5 in a final-frame thriller. </p> <p>And the signs that this was no fluke were there the following year in the same event, when Zhao beat both six-time world champion Steve Davis and Saturday night‚Äôs UK opponent Hawkins by an emphatic 6-1 scoreline. Davis commented at the time: ‚ÄúThis boy was astonishingly good, and better than anybody I have ever seen at that age - and that includes Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan.‚Äù </p> <p>Zhao was rapidly acquiring the nickname of the ‚ÄòWildcard Menace‚Äô, a player with no pressure but huge talent and ability that the professionals simply didn‚Äôt want to meet in the first round having made a 10,000-mile round trip to China from the UK. </p> <p>He did it again at the Shanghai Masters against Marco Fu in 2014. The wildcard system, occasionally controversial, was widely utilised in China to help foster interest and give opportunity to talented and promising young amateur players, and few made better use of it than Zhao. Of the first 11 chances he was given, he won his first match against a professional no fewer than seven times. </p> <p>And having yet again knocked out professionals in the form of Jamie Jones and Kurt Maflin in Chengdu in 2014, Zhao admitted he was targeting a place in the professional ranks as soon as possible ‚Äì something that may have come as a mild relief to a few of his embarrassed victims. </p> <p>Speaking to this correspondent through an interpreter, Zhao said: ‚ÄúIt shows I am heading towards my goal of joining them as a professional, something I would like to do as soon as possible. </p> <p>‚ÄúI am very satisfied with the progress that I have made over the past two years, since playing here in Chengdu as a 15-year-old. I am gaining experience all the time, and I feel I have grown as a player working very hard on my game at the Academy in Beijing. </p> <p>‚ÄúI was born in Xi‚Äôan but grew up mainly in Shenzhen before moving to Beijing which is my practice base now between tournaments. My dream is of course to win a world championship in the future. But for now the immediate goal is to get on to the man tour and be a professional snooker player. </p> <p>‚ÄúIf that happens I will then move to Britain and be based there for at least some of the year, as many other Chinese players have done. My favourite player is Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, he is very successful and also plays snooker with a lot of style that I enjoy watching.‚Äù </p> <p>And the youngster eventually got his wish to join the tour in 2016 at the age of 19 ‚Äì losing the World Amateur Championship but picking up the tour spot when winner Pankaj Advani declined to take up the place. And from then it has been a steady climb up the rankings up to his pre-UK position of No26 ‚Äì though that will rise further on Monday. </p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>Pep Guardiola's side ran out 3-1 winners against Watford at Vicarage Road</description>

<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>A fine brace from Bernardo Silva earned Manchester City a 3-1 victory against Watford at Vicarage Road, which propelled last season‚Äôs title-winners to the top of the Premier League table.</p> <p>The Portuguese playmaker‚Äôs <a href="https://www.thesportsman.com/articles/best-in-the-world-silva-has-proven-he-is-crucial-to-man-city-s-title-defence">fine form in the Premier League</a> continued as he was the star man once again as City won comfortably in Hertfordshire. The midfielder is magic, there is no other way to describe him and his second goal was particularly spectacular. </p> <p>His brace tonight saw his tally for the season rise to seven, equalling his best ever goalscoring return in the league which he recorded in the 2018-19 season. It‚Äôs not just his goals that have been crucial to Pep Guardiola‚Äôs side this term; his movement, passing and his incredible dribbling have all come to together to form what his manager described earlier this week as "the best player in the world."</p> <p>The reigning champions imposed themselves quickly into the game as Raheem Sterling opened the scoring inside just five minutes after heading in an inviting cross by Phil Foden. Jack Grealish could have doubled City‚Äôs lead only moments later when he found himself unmarked in the middle of the box for a corner, but his header was straight into the arms of Daniel Bachmann. </p> <p>The hosts didn‚Äôt drop after going a goal down, and while City were largely in control, Watford did look dangerous when they pressed. Emmanuel Dennis had a snapshot saved by Ederson in one of the few times the Hornets were able to break into the final third. But then they found themselves two goals down after the half-hour mark as Silva fired in from the right side of the box. It then became too easy for the champions as the game looked more like a training exercise.</p> <p>The Cityzens continued to push for goals in the second half and had a few good openings in the early stages, but failed to capitalise. Foden had an effort ricochet off the post and tipped behind for a corner by Bachmann, while an Ilkay Gundogan effort went over the crossbar. The third goal of the game finally arrived as top goalscorer Silva popped up with his second of the game with an outstanding curling effort into the top left corner. </p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üó£ &quot;He danced inside and curled it deliciously into the top corner!&quot;<br><br>Two for Bernardo Silva üî•<br><br>üì∫ Watch live on Sky Sports Premier League<br>üì≤ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WATMCI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WATMCI</a> blog üëâ <a href="https://t.co/25dfONHdyU">https://t.co/25dfONHdyU</a> <a href="https://t.co/NupTxGGemO">pic.twitter.com/NupTxGGemO</a></p>&mdash; Sky Sports Premier League (@SkySportsPL) <a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1467206110868385801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>The Hornets pulled a goal back in the latter stages of the game as substitute Cucho Hernandez‚Äôs second effort was flapped in by Ederson after his first hit the far post. Though it was a little more than a consolation for Watford, it will have been a bitter blow for the Brazilian goalkeeper who was close to recording his 100th Premier League clean sheet. The goal sparked Claudio Ranieri‚Äôs players into life and after looking dead and buried, they started to look more of a threat and Josh King should have grabbed a second but his effort was fired wide.</p> <p>In their usual fashion, City were able to regroup and see the result out and claim top spot. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.thesportsman.com/articles/west-ham-come-from-behind-twice-to-earn-sensational-victory-over-chelsea">Chelsea fell to a shock 3-2 defeat away to West Ham</a>, leaving the door open for City and Liverpool, who beat Wolves 1-0, to leapfrog them in the table. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/Screenshot2021-12-04at194033png.png" alt=""> </figure> ]]></content:encoded>

<category>Snooker</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Luca Brecel became the first player from mainland Europe to reach the final of any of snooker‚Äôs Triple Crown events on Saturday.  </p> <p>The brilliant Belgian is into Sunday‚Äôs Cazoo UK Championship showpiece at the York Barbican after beating England‚Äôs Kyren Wilson 6-4 with four century breaks.  </p> <p>And world No40 Brecel, 26, will attempt to make history and fuel the snooker boom across the Channel as he competes for the trophy and the ¬£200,000 first prize.  </p> <p>An astonishing barrage of scoring from the player hailed from a very young age as a potting prodigy left Wilson dazed and bemused ‚Äì including breaks of 130, 105, 59, 102, 97, 80 and 112.  </p> <p>Brecel, who has got to the quarter-finals of both the Masters and the World Championship, now has the chance to deliver on a huge potential ‚Äì and it is just a surprise the China Championship is his only big title to date.  </p> <p>The United Kingdom and Ireland have always been snooker heartlands, but following the major expansion into China, Thailand and the Far East a major champion from Europe is high on the governing body's wish-list. </p> <p>The watching pundits and former UK champions in the BBC studio were left drooling. Shaun Murphy described Brecel as ‚Äúabsolutely unplayable‚Äù on this form. 1991 winner John Parrott insisted that Brecel was playing ‚Äúas good as anyone possibly can‚Äù.  </p> <p>Brecel said: ‚ÄúI feel unbelievable, it is a dream. I was so nervous last night and didn‚Äôt really sleep, dreaming of the final. But out there I was composed and didn‚Äôt think too much. </p> <p>‚ÄúI did play awesome today. I got out of position a few times in that last century break but I just managed to keep potting. It is the best feeling I have ever had in snooker at the end. </p> <p>‚ÄúMuch better in China when I won the title because there were so many people here. I hadn't played my best in the tournament before the semi-final, but today was different.‚Äù</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/ezgifcom-gif-maker83jpg.jpg" alt="Kyren Wilson"> <figcaption>Kyren Wilson</figcaption> </figure> <p>Wilson said: ‚ÄúWithout doubt the better man won on the day. Luca‚Äôs scoring was phenomenal, especially given the huge pressure out there. I felt the momentum start to shift earlier in the match, maybe I could have gone 4-2 up. </p> <p>‚ÄúBut I feel like I left everything out there, it is much worse if you don‚Äôt turn up. It has been a crazy event so who knows if they will go on to win it, everyone fancies their chances. But I have gone close, having got a new cue a week ago, so that gives you confidence.‚Äù </p> <p>It was a sweet moment for Brecel, who as a talented youngster forging his way struggled with some aspects of life on tour.  </p> <p>The travel, time away from home, lack of facilities and practice partners at home and at various times lack of dedication, loss of form, a shoulder injury and cue problems left him ‚Äúdepressed‚Äù a couple of seasons ago. But this was a real reward for a great deal of recent hard work.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Having made the final a beaming Brecel admitted that he had suffered a real scare earlier in the tournament ‚Äì by managing to lock himself in the bathroom of his York apartment shortly before being due to take to the arena to face Anthony Hamilton. </p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">After a brief panic his girlfriend helped summon the manager and after a worrying 10 minutes with fears of being docked a frame or worse for being late for the scheduled start running through his head, Brecel managed to break free and make it over to the Barbican just in the nick of time. </p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">He added: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe everyone knows about it now ‚Äì it is my girlfriend, she told Shaun Murphy and then he just told everyone on live TV! In the end it was all okay ‚Äì and I won the match 6-1 against Anthony so I think I would have been okay even if I had been there a bit longer!‚Äù </p> <p>The barrage began right from the very start, with the Belgian knocking in a break of 130. But Wilson, who did very little wrong throughout the match, responded in kind with a 121.  </p> <p>Brecel then made it three centuries in consecutive frames with another superb run of 105, and looked shocked when despite a 59 in the next Wilson pinched it with a 69 to level at 2-2.  </p> <p>Wilson, who showed he can hang tough in the magnificent 6-5 quarter-final victory over Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, showed he would never wilt by edging in front at 3-2.  </p> <p>That merely sparked more excellence from his 26-year-old opponent who rattled in breaks of 102, 97 and 80 to put him on the brink before an 83 from Wilson cut the deficit.  </p> <p>However a mistake from Wilson when Brecel had been wondering about a re-rack in frame 10 gifted him one last chance from which he knocked in a crucial clinching break of 112.  </p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/20763312.2">Brecel is 10/11 to win the UK Championship with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The Magpies picked up a vital three points against Burnley, while Liverpool move to the top of the Premier League </description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>It took 15 matches but Newcastle United finally collected their first Premier League win of the season as they defeated Burnley 1-0 at St James‚Äô Park thanks to a Callum Wilson strike. Eddie Howe will be delighted at his players‚Äô determination to grind out the result which they have desperately needed to try and turn their season around.</p> <p>The result saw Newcastle‚Äôs points tally rise to 10, the same amount as today‚Äôs opponents and fellow bottom three side Norwich City. They are now just three points away from safety and Howe will be eager to build on this result and the confidence levels that will have been raised amongst his squad as we head into one of the most difficult months of the season. The defence defended with their bodies on the line and the forward players dropped back to aid them, helping the side to their first clean sheet of the campaign </p> <p>After a slow start to the game at St James‚Äô Park, Newcastle grew into the game and were able to take the lead just before half-time as Wilson fired the Magpies into the lead against Sean Dyche‚Äôs side. Burnley did look dangerous with Chris Wood and their star of the season so far Maxwel Cornet leading the line, but once the Ivorian was substituted off it seemed all of the threat the Clarets had gone off with him.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THREE ùóõùó®ùóöùóò POINTS FOR THE MAGPIES! üôå <a href="https://t.co/u1msBwopr6">pic.twitter.com/u1msBwopr6</a></p>&mdash; Newcastle United FC (@NUFC) <a href="https://twitter.com/NUFC/status/1467175453660258314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>At the top of the table, Liverpool left it late as Divock Origi‚Äôs goal earned them a 1-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. The dramatic late goal in stoppage time propelled the Reds to the top of the Premier League.</p> <p>Liverpool knew after Chelsea‚Äôs defeat at West Ham gave them a chance to leapfrog their title rivals with a victory over Wolves. They had plenty of chances in the first half but lacked their usual quality in the final third, with former Wolves attacker Diogo Jota and Mohamed Salah both missing some big chances. The hosts were able to conjure a few chances themselves but like the visitors, they couldn‚Äôt make them count. </p> <p>Midfielder Thiago had an effort early in the second half denied by Jose Sa after having his first attempt blocked. Jota then had a golden opportunity to put Jurgen Klopp‚Äôs side in front but he squandered his chance, and you just felt it wasn‚Äôt going to be Liverpool‚Äôs day in front of goal. Origi though, the scorer of some of Liverpool‚Äôs biggest goals in recent years, popped up at the death to give Klopp‚Äôs side the lead and send the away end and the bench into pandemonium.</p> <p>Elsewhere, on the south coast Southampton conceded late on to draw 1-1 with Brighton in the south coast derby at St Mary‚Äôs Stadium as Graham Potter‚Äôs side rescued a point they didn‚Äôt really deserve on the balance of things. The Saints were completely in control of the game and after several chances in the first-half they finally took the lead just before the half-hour mark as Armando Broja coolly fired past Robert Sanchez. It was a goal that the Saints thoroughly deserved as Brighton really struggled to get going and were constantly on the back foot. </p> <p>The second half was rather quiet but out of nowhere, Neal Maupay, like he did against West Ham midweek, popped up to rescue a point with a late strike deep into injury time. The Seagulls‚Äô winless run now stretches to 10 games in the top-flight.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The Hammers ran out 3-2 winners against Chelsea at the London Stadium on Saturday</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>West Ham United earned a sensational and hard-fought victory as they defeated Chelsea 3-2 at the London Stadium to give themselves some breathing room in the Premier League‚Äôs top four.</p> <p>There is always a lot of buzz surrounding all-London fixtures, and this one certainly lived up to the billing with five goals, two of them exquisite strikes, and the usual grit and determination seen in a derby day performance.</p> <p>It was another outstanding win for the Hammers and a step in the right direction as they bounced back from recent defeats to Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester City. Manager David Moyes will have been disappointed with the sloppy goals they gave away, but will have been pleased with his side‚Äôs response after going behind twice. The Scotsman‚Äôs in-game management was incredibly astute and his second half tweaks that saw Pablo Fornals and Said Benrahma join the attack, allowed his side to get on the front foot and cause problems for Chelsea.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What have we just witnessed?! üò≤<br><br>Extraordinary from Arthur Masuaku!<br><br>David Moyes loves it! üòÖ <a href="https://t.co/7GsyCfo6x7">pic.twitter.com/7GsyCfo6x7</a></p>&mdash; Football on BT Sport (@btsportfootball) <a href="https://twitter.com/btsportfootball/status/1467136713847975937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>West Ham had an early chance as Michail Antonio swung in a cross from the left, but the rising Tomas Soucek could not direct his header on target. Straight down the other end, Chelsea‚Äôs top scorer Reece James tried his luck from range but his effort was gathered by Lukasz Fabianski. After a rather dull half, Chelsea broke the deadlock on the half-hour mark as Thiago Silva headed home from a corner. The Brazilian then prevented a goal down the other end almost immediately as he cleared Vladimir Coufal‚Äôs goalward effort as Edouard Mendy was beaten. </p> <p>The Hammers found their way back into the game after a Chelsea error led to Mendy fouling Bowen in the box and Manuel Lanzini stepped up to convert from the penalty spot, but the visitors restored their lead before the break as Mason Mount finished a swift counter-attack with a volley that nestled in at the near post.</p> <p>West Ham were able to pull level for the second time in the match ten minutes into the second half as Bowen fired in a low effort into the far corner, bringing the London Stadium back to life. Chelsea continued to threaten but West Ham were looking resolute and determined to prevent the Blues from grabbing a third. </p> <p>After former Blue Kurt Zouma was forced off with an injury, Spaniard Fornals was called into action to add a creative spark in the Hammers attack in the hopes of potentially nicking the game. It was clear that the additions of Fornals and Benrahma were having an effect and it galvanised West Ham to find a winner, albeit a fortuitous one. Substitute Artur Masuaku was on the left flank and it was clear that he was looking to put a ball into the box, but a mis-hit confused Mendy in the goal and he couldn‚Äôt prevent the ball from hitting the back of the net. </p> <p>The result meant Chelsea suffered their second defeat of the season and will be music to the ears of title rivals Manchester City and Liverpool. The Reds can overtake Chelsea at the summit if they beat Wolves this afternoon.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Watford vs Man City: A Team With Three Strikers Against A Team With None</title>

<description>While Man City are accustomed to playing with no strikers, Watford have three in-form forwards.</description>

<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Who needs a centre forward? Certainly not Manchester City. The bewitching Bernardo Silva is their top Premier League scorer with five goals. Fellow midfielders Ilkay Gundogan and Phil Foden are next on the list with three goals apiece. The highest-ranking City forward in the scoring charts is Gabriel Jesus, who is tied with Kevin de Bruyne on two goals. Contrast this with Watford, who have three of their forwards on five goals or more. Emmanuel Dennis has notched six, while Josh King and Ismaila Sarr have both matched Bernardo‚Äôs five. Saturday‚Äôs game at Vicarage Road matches a team with no standout forwards against a team with several.</p> <p>City did not budget for going striker-less this season. While the strategy was often effective last season, when injuries limited Sergio Aguero to twelve league appearances, they had hoped to replace the illustrious Argentine with Harry Kane for this campaign. When that protracted transfer failed, City turned their attention to elite finisher Cristiano Ronaldo. That move collapsed when the Portugal international opted for an Old Trafford return. The Cityzens find themselves second in the table heading into the festive period, and Bernardo has drawn plaudits as perhaps the best player in the league. But they may have usurped leaders Chelsea if they had a top striker in their ranks.</p> <p>Watford don‚Äôt have that problem. Their front three has dovetailed fantastically so far, with all their first-choice forwards getting in on the action. Emmanuel Dennis scored on his debut in a 3-2 win over Aston Villa and has never looked back. Josh King arrived on a free after a goalless eleven-game spell at Everton. He has now played the same amount of league games for Watford, and has notched five goals. Ismaila Sarr, the guiding light that helped get them back into the Premier League, has also netted five times.</p> <p>Of course this is a simplification, and simply one facet of what teams have traditionally needed to be successful. City sit second in the table while Watford languish in seventeenth. Also, the broader attacking statistics swing wildly in City‚Äôs favour. They have recorded 29 goals to Watford‚Äôs 19. City‚Äôs spread of scorers is also far greater, with thirteen players hitting the net for the champions. Only three Watford players have found the net outside their in-form forwards.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/ezgifcom-webp-to-jpg26jpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Interestingly though, when weighted for expectations, you could argue the Hornets are performing better. The Hertfordshire club have scored more goals than Arsenal, who sit fifth in the table, and have also out-scored all their immediate relegation rivals. By contrast, City have scored less than table-toppers Chelsea and their other main title rival, Liverpool. This would suggest that specialist forwards are an effective way to meet your realistic expectations.</p> <p>Ultimately, both teams will stick to their approach for now. Watford manager Claudio Ranieri has little reason to tinker with his attacking approach, with defensive frailties more of a concern. While it seems inevitable City will make a high-profile acquisition at centre forward, that is unlikely to take place this January. For now, these teams will take opposite roads to try and achieve their goals this season.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Thrilling End To Year For The Lightweights Can Springboard Division Into Blockbuster 2022</title>

<description>Lightweight stars Devin Haney and Gervonta Davis are both in action this weekend</description>
<dc:creator>Kieran Spratt</dc:creator>
<category>Boxing</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>About this time last year, in this same publication, I wrote that 2021 would be a landmark year for boxing‚Äôs lightweight division. Teofimo Lopez, Devin Haney, Gervonta Davis, Ryan Garcia had taken over at 135lbs and it seemed we had the closest thing to the Four Kings (Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns and Marvin Hagler) since the legendary quartet reigned supreme in the 1980s. Let‚Äôs not forget the ultra-talented Vasiliy Lomachenko on the fringes either. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the prediction turned out to be something of a damp squib. That‚Äôs not to say it‚Äôs been a complete wash out; Garcia stopped the tough Luke Campbell in January, while Haney put in a career best effort to beat three-weight world champion Jorge Linares in May. Last weekend was the most impressive of them all, with underdog George Kambosos Jr shocking the world to beat Lopez on the judges‚Äô scorecards and snatch the WBA, WBO, IBF and The Ring belts from the American‚Äôs grasp. Overall though, we‚Äôve seen only a smidgen of potential from boxing‚Äôs most stacked weight class.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/boxing/original/ENM16094jpg.jpg" alt="George Kambosos Jr"> <figcaption>George Kambosos Jr</figcaption> </figure> <p>However, in the dying embers of 2021, starting with Kambosos‚Äô Upset of the Year contender against Lopez on Saturday, the division has kicked itself back into life and it could provide a springboard for a blockbuster 2022. The Australian is <em>the</em> guy right now and has a bevvy of world class options in front of him including Garcia, who voiced interest in the fight on social media, Haney and Davis, should they win their bouts this weekend, Lomachenko, should he also emerge victorious later this month, or a second fight with Lopez.</p> <p>And that‚Äôs just Kambosos, who wasn‚Äôt even in the frame this time last year. This weekend sees two of the aforementioned lightweight superstars in action: Haney and Davis. Like Lopez before him, Haney faces another potential curveball for the 135lbs division in the form of 32-1-1 (15) Californian Joseph ‚ÄòJoJo‚Äô Diaz when ‚ÄòThe Dream‚Äô defends his WBC strap at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. </p> <p>The following day, just 270 miles away in Los Angeles, ‚ÄòTank‚Äô Davis defends his WBA regular belt against Isaac Cruz, hoping to extend his unbeaten record and make it 25 knockouts from 26 fights. Kambosos will be on a recon mission at both bouts before he heads back down under, signalling that one of these men could be in the opposite corner when he decides to defend his crown, A tantalising proposition that would kick off the new year with a bang.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/boxing/original/ezgifcom-webp-to-jpg17jpgjpg.jpg" alt="Devin Haney"> <figcaption>Devin Haney</figcaption> </figure> <p>Our lightweight feast concludes next week with a man who‚Äôs largely been shut out of the conversation on the division‚Äôs current best: Lomachenko. A decorated amateur and three-weight world champion in just a handful of fights, ‚ÄòLoma‚Äô is widely regarded as one of the finest technicians in the game.</p> <p>His career came off the tracks in 2020 when he was stunned by Lopez, losing the same titles Kambosos holds now in the process. It‚Äôs been a year of rebuilding for the two-time Olympic gold medallist and following on from a TKO win against Masayoshi Nakatani in June, he takes on former IBF lightweight champion Richard Commey on December 12. A win against the tough Ghanian puts the 33-year-old right back in the mix. Perhaps Lopez, who has no guarantees of a rematch with Kambosos, will be more willing to entertain round two with the great Ukrainian now.</p> <p>So imagine Lomachenko, Haney and Davis all win over the next fortnight, which, on paper, they should. We could hypothetically have Lomachenko vs Lopez, Haney vs Kambosos for the chance to become undisputed and Garcia vs Davis on the side all in the first half of 2022. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/boxing/original/VasylLomachenkojpg.jpg" alt="Vasiliy Lomachenko "> <figcaption>Vasiliy Lomachenko </figcaption> </figure> <p>Sadly, boxing is never that straight cut. There‚Äôll be twists, turns and promotional red tape before the year is even out - maybe even this weekend should Haney and Davis get unstuck in their respective bouts - but that is just a taste of some of the fun that could be had at lightweight next year.</p> <p>We‚Äôre witnessing a golden generation at 135lbs, let‚Äôs just hope we actually get to see it shine.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/market-group/16741562.2">Diaz is 5/1 to upset Haney with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Chelsea And Declan Rice: The Long-Rumoured Transfer That Neither Of Them Need</title>

<description>Despite the constant links, Rice and Chelsea are far from a match made in heaven.</description>
<dc:creator>Joey Mills</dc:creator>
<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>There are very few sure things in football, but one you can count on is Declan Rice getting linked with a move to Chelsea. The England midfielder started out in the Stamford Bridge youth ranks before moving to the club they play this weekend, West Ham United. The way Rice has developed, and his authoritative performances for club and country, have seen whispers of a Chelsea return get ever louder. </p> <p>West London is not Rice‚Äôs only rumoured destination. The Manchester United links are unsurprising, especially considering the last top class holding midfielder they had is now their caretaker manager. But Chelsea are still considered his likeliest destination when he eventually leaves the London Stadium. Putting aside the intoxicating narrative of the prodigal son‚Äôs return though, do they need him?</p> <p>Rice is a player of undoubted quality and, with all due respect to West Ham, it does feel inevitable he will end up at a club with title ambitions in the near future. But putting aside his boyhood affiliations, Chelsea might actually be the club who need him the least amongst the top sides in England. As mentioned, United feels an obvious fit. Liverpool have looked a little bare in central midfield at times this season, and Rice would certainly be an upgrade in that department. Manchester City aren‚Äôt crying out for a defensive midfielder, but at the same time Fernandinho surely can‚Äôt go on forever. It is easy to envision Rice turning out for any of these sides.</p> <p>In contrast, Chelsea have the two highest ranked central midfielders in this year‚Äôs Ballon d‚ÄôOr vote. Jorginho came 3rd, while N‚ÄôGolo Kante ranked 5th. While he usually operates slightly further forward, Mason Mount also came 19th in the same ranking. Beyond these gilded individuals, Chelsea also have a resurgent Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Mateo Kovacic and loanee Saul Niguez. Admittedly, the latter is underperforming and not yet a permanent addition, but this depth in the middle of the park leaves little room for a new signing.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/DwtvzTnXgAAlYU4jpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>There is an area where Chelsea could use reinforcements, and it‚Äôs an area Rice has experience in. Chelsea‚Äôs defensive situation could become a problem next season, for a variety of reasons. Both Andreas Christensen and Antonio Rudiger are yet to sign contract extensions, and as things stand they will be free to discuss terms with clubs abroad in the summer and leave for nothing. Thiago Silva‚Äôs deal will also expire at the end of the season. While the veteran is remarkable for his age, the fact he is 37 means Chelsea can‚Äôt rely on him for much longer. </p> <p>Declan Rice first broke through as a centre back for the Hammers, and there has been talk that Chelsea would look to bring him in as a defensive option. When asked by BBC Sport in 2019, Rice said that his preferred role is in central midfield. Whether the pull of the European champions would be enough to inspire a re-think remains to be seen. Rice has not played as a centre back on a consistent basis since the 2018/18 season, so such a move would be rather puzzling from both parties were it to come off.</p> <p>Declan Rice returning to Chelsea makes for a good story for the same reason Romelu Lukaku joining in the summer did. They are both players who excelled elsewhere after not getting many (or in Rice‚Äôs case, any) games at the Bridge. Along with Mohamed Salah and Kevin de Bruyne, it is seductive to wonder what could have been if these players had remained at Chelsea. But as Lukaku has found out during a difficult few months back in London, sometimes the wondering is preferable to the reality. </p> <p>Lukaku at least arrived at a team crying out for a striker. Rice would be coming into a team stacked with central midfield talent. While he seems certain to play for a team chasing the biggest honours one day, it is doubtful whether Chelsea is the right fit for Declan Rice.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21329323.2">West Ham are 18/5 to beat Chelsea with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>UFC Fight Night: Jose Aldo And Rob Font Collide In Bid To Set Up World Title Bids</title>

<description>Both Rob Font and Jose Aldo could find themselves in a title challenge after Saturday night.</description>

<category>Ufc</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship returns from a rare weekend off thanks to the annual American bonanza that is Thanksgiving, but is back with a bang. Headlining the card is former two-weight champion Jose Aldo, who will be fighting off the back of two consecutive wins. He faces a man just one place ahead of him in the UFC‚Äôs rankings at 135lbs, Rob Font, who can make it five wins in a row and stake his claim for a title shot after the rematch between Aljamain Sterling and Petr Yan. </p> <p>Aldo‚Äôs reputation precedes him immensely; a defensive wrestling expert with a penchant for brutal leg-kicks and prolific Muay Thai striking ability. At the age of 35, the Brazilian has entered the twilight of his career but you wouldn‚Äôt know it. He might not have the same fight-ending ability as his younger self but his last two bouts against Marlon Vera and Pedro Munhoz have seen two unanimous decision wins. </p> <p>His last time out was an incredible return to form and proved that he hasn‚Äôt lost his title credentials, with a dominating final ten minutes of the fight earning him the decision. His losses to Yan and Marlon Moraes do highlight that he may have lost his power but a fight against a strong boxing opponent like Font will give him a chance to prove that he‚Äôs worth a spot in the top three of the bantamweight division. After his boyhood football team, Flamengo, lost the Copa Libertadores final last week, he might also have some built up aggression to release in the cage. </p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bApCBBRVegw"></iframe> </figure> <p>Font made the switch to the UFC back in 2014 from the New England-based CES MMA. Aged 34, Font is in a similar position to his Brazilian counterpart, in that he too is in the twilight of his career. This is potentially the last chance he will get to reach ‚Äòcontender‚Äô status for the bantamweight title and he needs to make the most of what could be the toughest fight of his career so far. </p> <p>For the neutrals, this fight is sure to stay on the feet, with Aldo‚Äôs impressive 91% takedown defence rate and Font‚Äôs preference to ‚Äòstand and bang‚Äô rather than get caught in a clinch or on the ground. The American may also have to take a page from the Tony Ferguson book of conditioning, and perhaps practice kicking some lead pipes to help protect him from the vicious leg kicks that will be coming his way. Aldo tends to chop down the tree from its base, and if Font is unable to defend those kicks, it‚Äôs going to be a long night. </p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21421180.2">Aldo is 6/5 to beat Font with Betfred*</a></p> <p>Also featured on the card is fighting veteran Clay Guida, who will be facing another old hand in Leonardo Santos - a fight that might be a slow burner, rather than one of a barn variety. Jamahal Hill also returns to the cage for the first time since having his arm broken by Paul Craig last year, fighting Australia‚Äôs Jimmy Crute who found his way to the UFC via Dana White‚Äôs Contender Series back in 2018. </p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The 24-year-old reaches only the second semi final of his career.</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>World number 15 Jack Lisowski will be left ruing missed opportunities, as he let Zhao Xintong back into a game he looked like dominating. The young Chinese star has reached the second semi final of his career, having made the last four of the China Championship three years ago. Lisowski was on the brink of going 3-0 and then 3-1 up before the interval, but after the interval Zhao took every single frame on the way to victory.</p> <p>The first frame saw Zhao miss a costly blue, and ‚ÄòJackpot‚Äô wrapped up in just ten minutes. Lisowski was made to work harder in the second, as his opponent looked like nicking the frame before snookering himself on the yellow after potting a beautiful long red.</p> <p>Lisowski squandered his chances in the third, and when a brown stayed out at 57-56 it gave Xintong a chance to snatch the frame for 2-1. A red looked on by the top cushion, and you‚Äôd have bet the house on Jack potting it, but the miss allowed ‚ÄòX-Factor‚Äô to draw level going into the break. On another night, Lisowski could have been 4-0 at this point and he would be punished for his misses.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ùó≠ùóõùóîùó¢ ùóõùóúùóßùó¶ ùóßùóõùóò ùóùùóîùóñùóûùó£ùó¢ùóß üá®üá≥ <br><br>Jack Lisowski 2Ô∏è‚É£-6Ô∏è‚É£ Zhao Xintong<br><br>6Ô∏è‚É£ frames in a row for the world number 26, who is through to his first ranking event SF. üëè <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKChampionship?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UKChampionship</a> <a href="https://t.co/mKJ3XwWVpQ">pic.twitter.com/mKJ3XwWVpQ</a></p>&mdash; Live Snooker (@Livesnooker) <a href="https://twitter.com/Livesnooker/status/1466885074482339841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>Lisowski initially looked refreshed after the interval, racing ahead with a break of 61. Xintong answered back brilliantly, clearing with 74 to go in front for the first time in the match. From this point, the Chinese player never looked back. A closing break of 33 kept the momentum going as he took the sixth frame. Xintong was beginning to dominate now, and a 56 break in the seventh put him within a frame of the semi final.</p> <p>Xintong took his sixth straight frame with his best break of the night, a spectacular 83 handing him a victory to savour. The 24-year-old has been backed to become a force in world snooker by Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan, Stephen Hendry and Jimmy White. Displays like this demonstrate why the greats of the game are tipping him for success.</p> <p>The evening session‚Äôs other quarter final ended in a 6-1 win for Barry Hawkins over Andy Hicks. It‚Äôs been a fairytale run for Hicks, who was a semi finalist at this event 26 years ago, but the underdog came unstuck against the world number 14.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>There are times when casual observers forget just how good a player John Parrott really was in his pomp. You often hear sweeping generalisations about Steve Davis dominating the 1980s, and then Stephen Hendry doing the same in the 1990s. And there is usually a nod to Dennis Taylor‚Äôs shock 1985 Crucible final win, and perennial Sheffield bridesmaid Jimmy White. </p> <p>But 1991 was unquestionably the year of the Liverpudlian, when Parrott - a winner of nine ranking titles in his career - was at the peak of his considerable powers, even if bizarrely he did not quite ascend to No1 in the rankings. </p> <p>He played brilliantly at the World Championship, beating Tony Knowles 13-1, Terry Griffiths 13-10 and Steve Davis 16-10 before outplaying the Whirlwind in the final for an 18-11 triumph and a trophy he had to parade at Anfield rather than Goodison Park - home of his beloved Everton - because the Blues were playing their final league game away from home. ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã</p> <p>But for all that, when November came around Parrott was desperate to add the UK Championship, the second-biggest of the three Majors, to his CV for special, personal and geographical reasons. The tournament took place at the Guild Hall in Preston ‚Äì a venue with particular resonance and meaning for Parrott. </p> <p>Parrott, now 57, recounts: ‚ÄúFunnily enough the UK was probably the one I wanted to win more than anything when I first started out. I went there with my father to watch, the first time I had gone to a big tournament when I was about 14 at the Guild Hall and looking on it confirmed to me I wanted to be a professional player. </p> <p>‚ÄúIt was local for me, 40 minutes up the road and I went back frequently after that. I remember Willie Thorne beating Dennis Taylor on the next table in the second round, and then I played Willie in the next round and won that one. Then it was Dean Reynolds, before James Wattana in the semis who was a real nightmare at the time, and very hard to play against. He always played well against me. </p> <p>‚ÄúJimmy had beaten Stephen Hendry 9-2 in the other semi-final and I knew he was in good form. And it was one of those in the final. He probably thought he was the favourite, and I thought I was the favourite. We were both at our peak, really. I think in our career our head to head was almost level. </p> <p>‚ÄúIt was a great final, I made an 80-odd to clinch it and looked up to see my dad in his white shirt with as big smile on his face and thinking ‚ÄòYeah‚Ä¶that was the one I wanted‚Äô. 13 years later on from being in the crowd I am looking up at virtually the same chair where my dad was, this time holding the trophy. It was pretty special. Jimmy did get his revenge on me in the UK final 12 months later. </p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEW776h9ZCc"></iframe> </figure> <p>‚ÄúIn 1991 I was just at my peak, all the years of experience kicked in and it came together, I took a little while to get there. I found it harder to miss that year, I was so tuned up and had a fantastic new cue. I could have held all three majors at the same time, but lost to Stephen Hendry in the Masters final in 1992. That was one regret, not winning the Masters. </p> <p>‚ÄúI was a pretty good all-round player. I could play safe, you got introduced early to the baulk cushion up against Terry and Cliff Thorburn and Steve Davis and everyone. But I could score , too. My temperament was okay though I could shake my heads with the best of them, but I always tried and was punching away and doing my best, and I was okay in final-frame deciders. </p> <p>When Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan blew through the sport, Parrott was one player he struggled to break down. The Merseysider finished with a rare 8-4 career winning record against the Rocket. Parrott added: ‚ÄúI always enjoyed playing Ronnie and think I had the right attitude against him. I thought I‚Äôd get chances, and just had to score heavily against him and show him you were there to play. My record was good, and it was 8-2 until the last couple of years when he got a couple back. </p> <p>‚ÄúThere were great players in my era ‚Äì Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, Jimmy White and myself, and I was No2 in the world for three years up against that lot! There was an event in Monaco when I beat the three of them in the draw‚Ä¶and I know that at my peak playing well I was okay. Maybe I was a bit like Steve Cram, when you had Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett out there!‚Äù </p> <p>You would struggle to spend time with anyone who loves their sport more and will spend hours shooting the breeze about it than Parrott, whether it is football and Everton, golf, or national hunt horse racing. Parrott, who has a family link with current Everton assistant boss and former Toffees playing legend Duncan Ferguson, said: ‚ÄúWe are struggling a little at the moment, with a squad that isn‚Äôt very good ‚Äì a handful of players you‚Äôd keep, and the rest are not quite up to it after some mis-spending. But we have to stick it out and maybe sell to go forward. </p> <p>‚ÄúAnd then you have the other lot over the way who are just a very, very good team, with a good manager and a far superior recruitment process. It would be churlish to say anything else. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/WhatsAppImage2021-12-03at141749jpeg.jpeg" alt="John Parrott (Right)"> <figcaption>John Parrott (Right)</figcaption> </figure> <p>‚ÄúI love my golf and have been fortunate to play a lot of wonderful courses. For my 50th birthday my wife took me to play Pebble Beach, to tee it up there was special. It is a great golf course and sense of occasion. I love getting in the car and going up to Scotland, or on the boat and over to Ireland to play some of the fantastic links courses. I did Ballybunion, Doonbeg and Lahinch in Ireland, you‚Äôd struggle to get a better trip than that. There is an amazing sense of history at St Andrew‚Äôs, and nearer home I have Formby and Birkdale. </p> <p>‚ÄúAnd of everything probably jump racing is my favourite. I read it all every day, I have Racing UK in the house and back a few winners. But I am as happy at Bangor on Dee with no stand as I am at any of the big tracks like Cheltenham, if it‚Äôs good quality racing. There are only four or five courses in Britain I haven‚Äôt done ‚Äì Fontwell, Yarmouth, Market Rasen and Ffos Las are on the list.‚Äù </p> <p><em>All pictures courtesy of World Snooker Tour</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The world number three was eliminated by Kyren Wilson 6-5 in a game full of bizarre delays.</description>

<category>Snooker</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan saw hopes of an eighth UK Championship title dashed after a series of sit-down protests over crowd noise.The Rocket was agitated from the start of his quarter-final against Kyren Wilson at the York Barbican ‚Äì and was edged out 6-5 in a thriller by the world No5.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Snooker legend O‚ÄôSullivan has missed out on the chance of celebrating his 46th birthday in Sunday's final after Wilson gained revenge for a 2020 world final defeat.But on multiple occasions an irritated O‚ÄôSullivan sat down in his chair mid-break due to crowd interruptions - as boozed-up fans watching the other table came and went.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">The bars were heaving at the venue as a large pre-Christmas crowd turned up the volume in and out of the auditorium. And in a further long exchange with referee Jan Verhaas, O‚ÄôSullivan called for a photographer who was observing all the protocols to be thrown out of the arena.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">O‚ÄôSullivan said: ‚ÄúWith the crowd - I could see them out of the corner of my eye, and like I said to the referee that I had all day. I can deal with loads of movement or no movement ‚Äì but not both.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúBut I said to the referee I‚Äôm in no hurry and have no other plans, I have set aside today to play snooker so I am happy to wait. So no real issue.And it should be a standard for a photographer to have a tripod, which is why I asked him to be removed.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúI missed too many balls today and wasn‚Äôt clinical or good enough ‚Äì you can‚Äôt do that at the highest level. I did well to get five frames.Kyren is hungry and wants titles and to do what I have done in the game. I was like that when I was younger, and it‚Äôs good to see he has a real passion for the game."</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Wilson, who showed great character to shrug off both an O‚ÄôSullivan onslaught and the interruptions, had little sympathy. Ahead of a semi-final against Belgium‚Äôs Luca Brecel, he said: ‚ÄúThe crowds didn‚Äôt distract me, I just wanted to get on with it.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúI practice in a busy club in Northampton and there are always people walking around! So on my turn I just got on with it, and after a Covid spell with no fans it‚Äôs great to see them.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúRonnie is a flow player and all about momentum and it won‚Äôt be ideal for him stopping and starting. But we know there are two tables out there, and that crowds will move.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúIt is one of the biggest wins in my career. Sometimes the snooker gods don‚Äôt forgive you and I thought I‚Äôd maybe missed the boat not closing it out 6-3. But I always back myself under pressure.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúI have let a couple slip against Ronnie in the past, so it‚Äôs nice to get that one. We all know what it‚Äôs like against him, you are playing the crowd as well.The only thing that is missing from my CV are the big titles, and that is what I am here to try and put right.‚Äù</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/ezgifcom-webp-to-jpg18jpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Wilson sprang out of the traps with breaks of 92 and 117 to lead 2-0 before O‚ÄôSullivan got on the board. But the trouble started in frame four with dozens of spectators loudly leaving and entering the arena after a long frame between Luca Brecel and Anthony McGill on the second table.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">O‚ÄôSullivan complained to Verhaas and sat down mid-break on a run of 24 until the noise and disruption came a halt. He had reacted in the same way after similar problems earlier in the event. However after resuming he shrugged off the issue and levelled the match with a superb break of 115.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Wilson then stole the next frame with a break of 66, before the Rocket dished out some of the same medicine in the next with a 76 to tie it up at 3-3.There then followed another animated and agitated exchange between the seven-time UK champion and the official as O‚ÄôSullivan complained about a photographer.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">This resulted in the snapper being thrown out for not having a tripod for his camera, even though the monopod being used was totally within the regulations.A break of 71 saw Wilson, doing his best to ignore the antics, edge ahead once more before O‚ÄôSullivan staged TWO more sit-down protests in frame eight.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">First he went back to his seat after potting brilliant long opening red with fans noisily coming back in after the interval on table two. And after potting a brown he sat down again, telling the Dutch official, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the noise, I‚Äôd rather they all sit down - I‚Äôve got time, I‚Äôm not in a rush‚Äù. However Wilson held firm to move 5-3 up.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">It happened again at an even more key stage of the contest with O‚ÄôSullivan 5-4 down ‚Äì and when Wilson wilted by missing a red it was 5-5 in the blink of an eye.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Brecel saw off an out-of-sorts Anthony McGill 6-2 to reach a Triple Crown semi-final for the first time.The 26-year-old said: ‚ÄúI may have to play better and kill frames off quicker against Kyren. I thought Kyren had a good chance against Ronnie, and this will be big for both of us.‚Äù</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>Betfred's Matt Hulmes takes a look at Saturday's best races including Sandown, Aintree and Wetherby</description>
<dc:creator>Matt Hulmes</dc:creator>
<category>Horse Racing</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>A fascinating weekend of racing lies ahead with the bulk of the best action in front of the ITV cameras at Sandown and Aintree.</p> <p>Sandown plays host to the Tingle Creek Chase for the best two-mile chasers, while Aintree features action over the National Fences courtesy of the Becher Chase as well as the Many Clouds Chase, featuring 2018 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, Native River.</p> <p>Chepstow has the Welsh Grand National trial too while Wetherby also hosts a competitive card and there is graded action over in Ireland at Navan. It truly is a feast for racing fans this Saturday.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21422341.2">2.05 AINTREE ‚Äì NATIVE RIVER</a>*</strong></p> <p><strong>NATIVE RIVER </strong>runs in his third Many Clouds Chase and having won the race two years ago, he was undone by the low sun which took out all the jumping in the home straight last year. It still was a run below his best, but he proved later in the season that the fire still burns bright when winning the Cotswold Chase (rearranged at Sandown) and then fourth in the Gold Cup (best of the British) to end the season the highest rated staying chaser in Britain. </p> <p>The Tizzard‚Äôs are adamant he is still a force when he has his conditions and the heavens have opened just in time for him here.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/horse-racing/original/NATIVERIVER60JPG.jpg" alt="Native River"> <figcaption>Native River</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Protektorat</strong> is the obvious danger after his gallant effort under top weight in the Paddy Power Gold Cup. He also has the possibility of a Savills Chase tilt at Leopardstown over Christmas, and this will tell connections if he is up to that. A Grade 1 winner at this track in April, he will be tested for stamina by Native River on his step up to this three-mile one furlong trip and I‚Äôd just side with the proven stamina and class of the veteran.  </p> <p><strong>Imperial Aura</strong> came to grief in the Betfair Chase to make it three successive non-completions, but he too is a major contender if getting his act together. </p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21422333.2"><strong>2.25 SANDOWN ‚Äì GREANETEEN</strong></a></p> <p>The Tingle Creek is always a fascinating watch as the cream of the two-mile chasing division wing their way around Sandown and fly over the famous railway fences in the back straight. Its roll of honour is littered with champions, eleven of which have been provided by Paul Nicholls.</p> <p>He saddles two this year and although<strong> Hitman </strong>beat <strong>GREANETEEN </strong>at Exeter, that was in receipt of 17lb and the latter was electric when winning here in April, beating Altior, Sceau Royal and the reigning champion Put The Kettle On. Bryony Frost rides and after the week that has seen her part of a hearing at the BHA, it would be the best way to end a tough few days.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/horse-racing/original/GREANETEEN36JPG.jpg" alt="Greaneteen"> <figcaption>Greaneteen</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Hitman</strong> was backed like defeat was out of the question at Exeter and may still be a little wet behind the ears for a contest like this, while <strong>Captain Guinness</strong> has a few jumping frailties.</p> <p><strong>Nube Negra</strong> is obviously a huge danger on the back of his Shloer Chase win at Cheltenham. Last year's Champion Chase runner-up proved his well being there and will appreciate ground conditions more than the favourite <strong>Chacun Pour Soi</strong>, who finished just behind him in March. </p> <p><strong>Chacun Pour Soi</strong> has won seven of his nine starts for Willie Mullins, the only defeats coming at the festival and behind A Plus Tard at Leopardstown‚Äôs Christmas meeting in 2019. He is top rated but would prefer slower ground and is giving away a fitness advantage.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21422347.2"><strong>2.40 AINTREE ‚Äì KIMBERLITE CANDY & ACHILLE</strong></a></p> <p>My two against the field in the Becher Chase are dual runner-up <strong>KIMBERLITE CANDY</strong> and the grey <strong>ACHILLE</strong> for last weekend's big winners Venetia Williams and Charlie Deutcsh. </p> <p>Two of <strong>KIMBERLITE CANDY‚Äôs</strong> last four races have come in this very race, runner-up to Walk In The Mill in 2019 before filling the same spot behind Vieux Lion Rouge twelve months ago. He returns 3lb lower after his most recent effort saw him pull-up in the Grand National itself, while his only other run in the past two and half years saw him win the Classic Chase at Warwick. He acts on the ground, is well weighted, stays well and we know he loves this race so should be fighting it out come the finish.</p> <p>The other one I like is <strong>ACHILLE</strong> for the in-form Venetia Williams and Charlie Deutsch combination. The trainer has said he could develop into a National candidate and is a strong stayer who will have appreciated the recent rainfall on Merseyside. He was a close second in the Haydock Grand National Trial in February before a solid sixth in the Midlands National and has a lovely weight of 10-5 to carry. </p> <p><strong>Mac Tottie</strong> won the Grand Sefton over these fences last month and will be popular, while <strong>Snow Leopardess</strong> was impressive at Bangor on seasonal return and was a fine fourth in the National Hunt Chase at the Festival in March.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21422350.2"><strong>3.15 AINTREE ‚Äì TAMAR BRIDGE</strong></a></p> <p><strong>TAMAR BRIDGE</strong> should take plenty of beating in the lucky last at Aintree. He has only had the four starts, winning three of them. He was long odds on when winning easily at Wetherby five weeks ago and comfortably beat Bass Rock at Ayr back in March. He is now rated 132 so off a mark 4lb lower than that, his claims are clear to see, and connections have been waiting for the heavens to open to pitch him into handicap company. He could be well ahead of the handicapper. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/horse-racing/original/TAMARBRIDGE35AYRJPG.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p><strong>Kateson </strong>loves it at Aintree and is off the same mark as when winning this race twelve months ago so rates a danger, while Midnight River returns to hurdling after falling over fences at Carlisle and now has a slight question mark. </p> <p><strong>Pounding Poet </strong>and<strong> Winningseverything </strong>were second and fourth in a course and distance contest in October in which the winner has been placed at Cheltenham subsequently and are lightly enough raced to improve to contend also. </p> <p><strong>OTHER RACES</strong></p> <p>I am looking forward to seeing<strong> MIGHT I </strong>(12.05 Sandown) again as he looks a likely contender for leading honours in the two-mile novice hurdle division. Victory here and I could see him returning for the G1 Tolworth Hurdle next month.</p> <p><strong>DEISE ABA </strong>(3.00 Sandown) is looking to make it three from three at Sandown in the London National and the light raced 8yo was a good second over hurdles at Aintree last month. </p> <p><strong>Metier </strong>(3.35 Sandown) makes his eagerly anticipated return in the handicap that concludes the card at Sandown. Last year's Tolworth winner was last seen disappointing in the Supreme Novices Hurdle but will need to be fit to win here with some hardy handicappers such as <strong>Benson </strong>and <strong>Hudson De Grugy</strong> in opposition. </p> <p>The Welsh Grand National Trial is the feature at Chepstow but the likeliest candidate for that race could be seen earlier on the card when Harry Fry‚Äôs <strong>ASK ME EARLY </strong>(11:38 Chepstow) prepares for the big race later this month over hurdles having won over the smaller obstacles at Exeter last month. </p> <p>The Trial itself features 2019 Welsh national runner-up Truckers Lodge, who could manage no better than seventh in the 2020 running. A host or runners will be looking to enhance their claims of claiming the Welsh National itself back here in three weeks‚Äô time (27th December). </p> <p><strong>SIZABLE SAM </strong>(1:57 Chepstow) jumped and travelled well in the main on chasing debut at Ascot but just got tapped for some speed when they reached the business end. The step up to three miles looks sure to suit and he can off the mark over fences at the second attempt.</p> <p>*<em>All odds courtesy of Betfred | 18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The 30-year-old Scot is flying the flag for his nation at the UK Championship today</description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Anthony McGill admits he is still haunted by a terrifying car accident that saw the Scot cheat death on the way home from a snooker tournament.</p> <p>The 30-year-old from Glasgow is flying the flag for his nation at the UK Championship today after equalling a best previous run at the season's first major. But world No15 McGill, in quarter-final action at the York Barbican, has only just revealed the full horror of a smash driving home in dreadful conditions last season.</p> <p>With so many tour tournaments staged in England or Wales the travelling burden is heavy on the Scottish players. And as a result McGill is now far more cautious on motorways especially in heavy rain and snow after writing off a VW Golf and giving himself an almighty scare.</p> <p>The two-time ranking event winner, looking to land a first Triple Crown success, said: "I was in a car crash - and I should have died really.</p> <p>"I had lost to Mark Selby and was driving home to Glasgow that night from Milton Keynes...but smashed it up at 95 mph after hitting a puddle on the motorway and aqua-planing.</p> <p>"Ever since then I have just been sh*tting myself from all the travelling, especially driving in bad weather.</p> <p>"That was why I didn't want to be a reserve for the Masters earlier this year, it was shortly after the crash and the weather was so bad I didn't want to do it just in the hope I might get to play.</p> <p>"Even now I am really scared driving, but incredibly I came out with just a few scratches on my hand.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/Screenshot2021-12-03at133956png.png" alt="The aftermath of McGill's crash last season"> <figcaption>The aftermath of McGill's crash last season</figcaption> </figure> <p>"It's hard to believe looking at the car I came out alive, let alone a few scratches. It was a Golf before that crash, but it was a total write-off. I should have been a write-off as well, really.</p> <p>"I still feel fine driving in good weather, I just used to be maybe a bit careless when it was raining, and now I take it a lot easier.</p> <p>"York should be a three-hour drive for me, but I took six because it was bad weather and I was going so slowly."</p> <p>McGill has also been inspired by practice partner John Higgins - and started spinning classes to get fitter.</p> <p>And he is also relishing the prospect of a high-profile match on a big stage in front of a packed crowd.</p> <p>He added: "I have lost a bit of weight, only about half a stone. I go by myself, as I don't want to cramp John's style!</p> <p>"But I am looking forward to the quarter-finals. As I have shown at the Crucible I play some of my best snooker on the biggest stages - it's usually getting there that is the problem."</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>The Grand National winning jockey looks back at his past week and ahead to his three rides this weekend</description>
<dc:creator>Ryan Mania </dc:creator>
<category>Horse Racing</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><u><strong>My Week</strong></u></p> <p>So where were you at 3.15pm on Saturday 27th November? Hopefully you were all watching the excitement unfold in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle, a tactically exciting race finishing in a dead heat. I certainly have never seen a dead heat in a Grade 1 before but there were great rides given to both horses by jockeys Johnny Burke (Not So Sleepy) and Aiden Coleman (Epatante). It will be a race they talk to their grandkids about. </p> <p>Down at Newbury there was a great winner and an emotional one for the Ladbrokes Trophy - Cloudy Glen owned by the late Trevor Hemmings. He was an owner who gave so much to British and Irish horse racing over the years and who also gave me my first Cheltenham Festival winner. It was so great to see his colours win such a big race. </p> <p>My own weekend started off well as my wife and I attended the Northern Racing Awards at Newcastle Racecourse where I was nominated for jump ride of the year on Vintage Clouds at the Cheltenham Festival. Can you believe it, I actually won?! It meant a lot to me to be recognised for my achievement.</p> <p>Saturday's racing however was not so exciting. After 30mm of rain and battered by Storm Arwen we were surprised that Newcastle was on. Now the ground was soft and I thought that meant I had a great chance with <strong>Tresnish</strong>, but stepping him up to 2m4f proved the wrong decision as he didn‚Äôt stay. </p> <p><strong>Dingo Dollar</strong> ran a good race to finish third in the Rehearsal Chase on ground that wasn‚Äôt ideal for him. The race was run at a fierce pace with the first three being up on the pace together the whole way and no other horses got a look in. It was wonderful to see Aye Right win the race for trainer Harriet Graham. He ran some almighty races in defeat last year so he thoroughly deserved to get his head in front. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/horse-racing/original/DINGODOLLARjpg1.jpg" alt="Dingo Dollar"> <figcaption>Dingo Dollar</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Donna‚Äôs Double </strong>was most disappointing. He was one of the horses I was most looking forward to this season. He didn‚Äôt jump well and never really travelled. Hopefully Sandy Thomson can get to the bottom of whatever was bothering him because he is a horse with a lot of ability. </p> <p>It‚Äôs been a quiet week for me. Unfortunately, I was off ill Monday, Tuesday & Wednesday (yes, jockeys do get ill) so I missed a few rides. I am feeling better now and heading into the weekend with some nice rides to look forward to. Unfortunately, my intended ride for the Becher Chase at Aintree has ten stone which I‚Äôm not able to do so I head to Wetherby instead for three rides. </p> <p><u><strong>Weekend Rides</strong></u></p> <p>I‚Äôm at Wetherby on Saturday and my first mount is<strong> Shore Shanty</strong> for Harry Whittington. It will be my first ride for Mr Whittington, and I don‚Äôt know much about the horse but looking through its form, it will certainly have a chance. </p> <p><strong>SirWilliamWallace </strong>steps back up in trip for his second run of the season. He badly needed his first run so will hopefully be fitter this time. However, we are unsure if he really stays the three miles. His ideal trip could be 2 3/4 miles. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/horse-racing/original/SIRWILLIAMWALLACE125AYRJPG.jpg" alt="Sir William Wallace"> <figcaption>Sir William Wallace</figcaption> </figure> <p><strong>Golden Robin</strong> is another stepping up in trip and trying fences for the first time. After riding her at Sedgefield last time I thought she felt like a three-mile chaser so let‚Äôs hope I‚Äôm right and she improves for the trip and the fences. </p> <p>There is some cracking racing elsewhere on Saturday. Firstly, with the Tingle Creek at Sandown. A small but quality field will line-up with Paul Nicholls having two of the five runners and he will be hoping to stop the Irish from winning but unfortunately, I think it‚Äôs going to go the way of<strong> Chacun Pour Soi</strong>. I know it‚Äôs boring picking the favourite but on official ratings he is the one to beat. </p> <p>Aintree are back racing over those magnificent National fences with the Becher Chase. It is always difficult to pick a winner over these fences because so much can go wrong on the way round, which means it's best to stick to horses with course form.<strong> Mac Tottie </strong>won the Grand Sefton and although that race is half a mile shorter than the Becher he has form over three miles so the Becher trip shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. </p> <p>You couldn‚Äôt write off last year‚Äôs winner<strong> Vieux Lion Rouge</strong>, he is great around there. But I‚Äôm going to pop outside the box on my selection and go for <strong>Top Ville Ben</strong>, a quality horse on his day. Connections thought they may have had a Gold Cup horse at one stage. Now I‚Äôm hoping the big green fences spark a revival for the Phil Kirby trained 9yo.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/horse-racing/original/TOPVILLEBENjpg.jpg" alt="Top Ville Ben"> <figcaption>Top Ville Ben</figcaption> </figure> <p>Moving on to Sunday where I‚Äôm at my local and favourite track Kelso. The exciting novice chaser <strong>Doyen Breed</strong> goes in the Paris Pike Novice Chase. He was put up 13lb for his chase debut win, so he has a bit to prove. After Sunday we will either be thinking about a race at the Cheltenham Festival or asking the handicapper to drop him!</p> <p><br />  </p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Mersey Beat: Lyndon Arthur And Anthony Yarde Have Everything To Lose In Liverpool</title>

<description>The stakes could not be higher for this light heavyweight rematch.</description>
<dc:creator>Joey Mills</dc:creator>
<category>Boxing</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>British light heavyweight standouts Lyndon Arthur and Anthony Yarde will renew hostilities 364 days since their controversial first fight at the M&S Bank Arena in Liverpool this Saturday. Arthur won that first encounter via split decision, which still doesn‚Äôt sit right with Yarde. Both fighters are promising a more decisive end as they prepare to square off on Merseyside.</p> <p>Arthur was a firm underdog going into their first encounter. While he had been excellent at domestic level, capturing the Commonwealth title in 2019, Yarde had operated in world class. ‚ÄòThe Beast From The East‚Äô had come close to knocking out Sergey Kovalev in a 2019 tilt at the WBO title, and had rattled off two wins since that loss. It looked like ‚ÄòKing‚Äô Arthur had a mammoth task ahead of him.</p> <p>It was a task he took to as bravely as the mythical king that bears his name, outworking Yarde on the way to a tight, but deserved, decision. The win took Arthur to the top spot in the WBO rankings, and the Manchester man was hopeful that a shot at world honours would follow. It hasn‚Äôt panned out that way, with WBO belt-holder Joe Smith Jr opting to face another Brit in Callum Johnson. Instead, after a July TKO of Davide Faraci, Arthur returns to the scene of the crime to meet Yarde.</p> <p>It is a dangerous fight for Arthur, and one he should be applauded for taking. With his number one ranking with the WBO, he would have been front of the queue for a mandatory shot at the Smith Jr vs Johnson winner. Instead, he takes a rematch where the first fight was very close, and he once again enters as the betting underdog. While this displays incredible fortitude on the part of ‚ÄòKing Arthur‚Äô, it is also a tremendous risk. One need only look at the example of Dillian Whyte, who was levelled by Alexander Povetkin in a stay-busy fight while he was the WBC number one contender. A boxer mortgages their future when they step into the ring, none moreso than those on the cusp of a world title opportunity.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/boxing/original/ezgifcom-webp-to-jpg21jpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Yarde is also a man with plenty to lose as he prepares to step into the ring in Liverpool. Going into the first fight, he was a man who had only been defeated by one of the best light heavyweights of his era. Yarde remained a world-ranked contender, and was aiming to take care of this piece of domestic business before returning to the world scene. A loss, one he hotly disputes, is one thing. But if he is defeated again in the rematch, there isn‚Äôt anywhere else for him to go. At 30 years old, the road back to world level would be a difficult one to traverse. Instead, he would probably slot permanently into the domestic scene and have to watch while his conqueror goes on to bigger things. </p> <p>Another layer of intrigue in this contest concerns their respective trainers. There has been several eruptions between Yarde‚Äôs coach Tunde Ajayi and Arthur‚Äôs cornerman Pat Barrett. At the press conference to announce the rematch, the two fighters could barely get a word in as their trainers verbally sparred in front of the assembled media. Two trainers entering the fight needing to win as badly as their boxers is a fascinating ingredient in this top domestic clash.</p> <p>The first match was tactical, with few punches landed as a game of human chess played out. Both men have promised more ferocity this time. If this fight is more violent than the first, that plays into the hands of Yarde. He struggled to push the pace in their stop-start first affair, but if Arthur tries to trade he could come unstuck against a man with 20 knockouts from 21 wins. If Arthur sticks to his clever boxing, he could repeat the trick and finally secure a deserved crack at the world championship. Either way, it‚Äôs going to be fascinating to watch this fight of fine margins unfold.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21182847.2">Arthur is 11/10 to beat Yarde with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Kyren Wilson admits his quarter-final clash with record seven-time UK Championship winner Ronnie O‚ÄôSullivan on Friday feels almost like the real final at the York Barbican. </p> <p>And the 29-year-old from Kettering has cranked up the mind games - insisting he has nothing to lose and the pressure is all on the Rocket in a repeat of the 2020 World Championship showpiece. </p> <p>Though world No5 Wilson has won four titles he is desperate to get one of the game‚Äôs majors on his CV, having lost to O‚ÄôSullivan in a Crucible final and to Mark Allen at the same final hurdle in the Masters. </p> <p>O‚ÄôSullivan has moved through the draw as 11 former winners have tumbled out with one eye on celebrating his 46th birthday on Sunday while bidding to claim UK success No8. </p> <p>Wilson said: ‚ÄúPossibly it feels like the real final, if you are looking at the seedings and probably in terms of each other‚Äôs career. We are probably the highest-profile players left in.  </p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a bit of an odd one in terms of how the tournament has panned out, with lots of big seeds dropping out early. I am really looking forward to this one, it should be a cracking match. </p> <p>‚ÄúEven if it wasn‚Äôt Ronnie, we are in the quarter-finals of the UK Championship, and the venue becomes awesome. I‚Äôm under no pressure, whatsoever, I am like the young pretender trying to get there. Ronnie has been there, done it all, it‚Äôs potentially his to lose. </p> <p>‚ÄúTo a certain extent you would have to say that, being a seven-time champion of this tournament, he knows what it takes to win this event. I am not there yet. I haven‚Äôt won the tournament so I don‚Äôt what it feels like and what it takes to do that. But I believe in my ability and I know what I am capable of.  </p> <p>‚ÄúI have beaten Ronnie in some big matches previously to this one, and I know what it takes to beat him. It would be absolutely awesome to win one of the big three in our sport. I have been playing this game since I was six years old, you dream of lifting these titles, the UK, Masters and the world.  </p> <p>‚ÄúI have been close in the other two, getting to finals. It is nice to notch up results in this tournament as previously my results in the UK Championship weren‚Äôt too good.‚Äù </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/other/original/PA-59338084jpgjpg.jpg" alt="Ronnie O'Sullivan "> <figcaption>Ronnie O'Sullivan </figcaption> </figure> <p>Wilson came up short against O‚ÄôSullivan in the World Championship final 16 months ago, going down 18-8 ‚Äì but says he learned plenty in defeat. He added: ‚ÄúI learned a lot from it. I am a big believer in visualisation and stuff like that, and I can take my way back there right now. </p> <p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a good thing and a bad thing. If you look too much into it, it can destroy you, but if you can take the positives and try to take things you can learn from it going forward then that is great.‚Äù </p> <p>O‚ÄôSullivan, the hot title favourite, said: ‚ÄúIt would be strange if I became the second player to win a title on their 46th birthday this season, after Mark Williams! I am just trying to preserve myself from getting burned out, and you have to get used to dodgy results. You will never be on the start line for every tournament feeling good. </p> <p>‚ÄúLook at Michael van Gerwen in the darts. He is burned out. There is only so much of it you can do before you go like: I cannot do this anymore.‚Äù </p> <p>And he naturally has fonder memories of the Crucible final between the pair around 16 months ago, having claimed a slightly unexpected sixth world title as various things fell his way and ending a seven-year title drought on the game‚Äôs biggest stage in Sheffield. </p> <p>O‚ÄôSullivan: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect to get that far, to the final. When I got to the semi-finals, I thought I had done myself justice, I was happy with that in a way. When I got to the semi-finals, I just wanted to make the score respectable against Mark Selby. That was a goal of mine. I did that and then I managed to win that match. I don‚Äôt know how I did that, ever. </p> <p>‚ÄúThen in the final I really remember playing a very good last day against Kyren. Maybe some inexperience counted against him ‚Äì though I usually just think whoever plays the best snooker wins. </p> <p>‚ÄúAt some point experience has to count for nothing, if the guy produced a brilliant performance like Joe Johnson did against Steve Davis. He didn‚Äôt have much experience in those situations but went out and played a blinder. So I do think it‚Äôs on the day, having that temperament, playing at the right times, getting the big shots.‚Äù </p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21415502.2">Wilson is 8/5 to beat O'Sullivan with Betfred*</a></p> <p>* <em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>It's been another busy week in the world of boxing </description>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Oleksandr Usyk has said he would be willing to fight Tyson Fury if Anthony Joshua steps aside, Kell Brook versus Amir Khan is finally on and Ivan Drago could be returning to our screens. Here are five boxing stories you might have missed...</p> <p><strong>Usyk Open To Fighting Fury Next If AJ Was To Step Aside</strong></p> <p>Following rumours that Anthony Joshua could step aside from his rematch with Oleksandr Usyk, the Ukrainian‚Äôs promoter has said that his fighter would be more than willing to take on Tyson Fury for a chance to decide the heavyweight division‚Äôs undisputed champion. </p> <p>Joshua lost his IBF, WBA and WBO titles to Usyk in September and had activated the rematch clause in his contract but there have been whispers that the two-time world champion could be persuaded to step back if the money is right. It‚Äôs worth noting that at the moment this is nothing more than chatter, so take it with a pinch of salt. Everything we‚Äôve heard from AJ post-Usyk makes it seem as if he is a man chomping at the bit to gain revenge over his usurper. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/boxing/original/30AJANTHONYJOSHUAWHATNEXTjpg.jpg" alt="Anthony Joshua"> <figcaption>Anthony Joshua</figcaption> </figure> <p>Usyk‚Äôs promoter Alexander Krassyuk told <a href="https://www.skysports.com/boxing/news/12183/12483812/oleksandr-usyk-open-to-fighting-tyson-fury-next-if-anthony-joshua-allows-undisputed-clash-says-his-promoter">Sky Sports</a>, ‚ÄúThe talks on AJ's step aside have been around since Fury KO'd Wilder.</p> <p>"I heard that Joshua could consider stepping aside if the money is right as he feels respect to the division and is willing to let the undisputed heavyweight championship happen.</p> <p>"Usyk says that he can fight Fury next if the offer is right and if AJ allows to do so."</p> <p><strong>Fury Aiming To Fight Three Times In 2022</strong></p> <p>Tyson Fury‚Äôs Top Rank promoter Bob Arum has said that ‚Äòthe Gypsy King‚Äô is looking to fight three times in 2022 and that Dillian Whyte is the next ‚Äúlogical‚Äù fight.</p> <p>As evident from the prior story, the WBC and lineal heavyweight champion‚Äôs next fight has been the subject of intense speculation since he stopped Deontay Wilder in their third encounter in October, and Arum believes his next fight should be ‚Äòthe Bodysnatcher.</p> <p>‚ÄúI think Dillian Whyte should be the next fight for Tyson Fury,‚Äù Arum told <a href="https://talksport.com/sport/boxing/993435/bob-arum-tyson-fury-next-fight-whyte-joshua-usyk/">talkSPORT</a>.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got to push ahead and get a date and an opponent for Fury.</p> <p>‚ÄúAnd it seems to me that it is logical that it should be Dillian Whyte.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúWhat I would like to see, and this is what he would like to see, getting in the ring at the end of February or March and doing at least three fights in 2022.</p> <p>‚ÄúHopefully that is how it will all roll out, Fury is ready to fight anybody.</p> <p>‚ÄúI really believe that he is the pre-eminent heavyweight in the world, there is nobody out there that he would be reluctant to fight.‚Äù</p> <p><strong>Khan vs Brook Heading For February 19th In Manchester</strong></p> <p>After years of procrastination, <a href="https://www.thesportsman.com/articles/people-are-right-to-complain-about-brook-vs-khan-s-ppv-billing-but-we-will-all-still-watch">Amir Khan and Kell Brook</a> are finally set to do battle with the two Brit‚Äôs set to fight in Manchester on February 19.</p> <p>The pair, who have been on a collision course with one another for an eternity, will meet at a catchweight of 10st 9lb (149lbs), two pounds above the welterweight limit, and the bout will be broadcast on Sky Box Office under the Boxxer banner. </p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/boxing/original/5nNKF0fQjpg.jpg" alt="Khan and Brook Collide On Feb 19th"> <figcaption>Khan and Brook Collide On Feb 19th</figcaption> </figure> <p>"Amir Khan will hit the deck for the final time," Brook said following a heated London press conference announcing the fight. </p> <p>"I'm coming levels down taking this fight," Khan insisted. "I've fought the best in the world and conquered America".</p> <p><strong>WBO Order Demetrius Andrade To Fight Janibek Alimkhanuly</strong></p> <p>The WBO have ordered Demetrius Andrade to defend his middleweight world title against Janibek Alimkhanuly.</p> <p>The unbeaten American, who blitzed Jason Quigley inside two rounds in New Hampshire a fortnight ago, has been pursuing a big name in the division for years but, for now, that will have to wait. </p> <p>Alimkhanuly is certainly no pushover, though. The US-based Kazakhstan native is also unbeaten with a record of 11 wins and seven knockouts and is coming in off the back of an impressive seventh round stoppage of Hassan N‚ÄôDam N‚ÄôJikam last month</p> <p><strong>Ivan Drago Rocky Spin Off En Route?</strong></p> <p>There could be some great news for fans of the Rocky franchise on the way as Dolph Lungdren, star of the <a href="https://www.thesportsman.com/articles/on-this-day-in-1985-rocky-iv-balboa-s-greatest-adventure-arrives-at-cinemas">series‚Äô fourth instalment</a>, has revealed a tantalising hint that a spin-off involving his iconic character, Ivan Drago, could be on the way.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/dolph-lundgren-aquaman-2-drago-spinoff-1235053570/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the 64-year-old said, ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs some talk about doing a whole spinoff on Drago with MGM.

<description>Hawkins won five straight frames to take a 6-3 victory.</description>

<category>Snooker</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>‚ÄòThe Hawk‚Äô has flown into the quarter finals of the UK Championship after a 6-3 comeback win over Matthew Selt at the York Barbican. Barry Hawkins has reached the quarter finals of this competition for the first time since 2013, which came in the same year that he reached the final of the World Snooker Championship.</p> <p>The two-time Triple Crown finalist was 3-1 down going into the interval, with his long-potting letting him down and allowing Selt to build a considerable lead. Hawkins was the favourite on paper, and had defeated the same opponent in the first round of the 2021 World Championship. But Selt had already brought about one of the shocks of the tournament, when he knocked out tournament favourite Judd Trump 6-3 in the third round.</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ùóßùóõùóò ùóõùóîùó™ùóû ùó¶ùó¢ùóîùó•ùó¶ ùóßùó¢ ùó©ùóúùóñùóßùó¢ùó•ùó¨ ‚úÖ <br><br>Barry Hawkins 6Ô∏è‚É£-3Ô∏è‚É£ Matthew Selt<br><br>5Ô∏è‚É£ successive frames see the world number 14 through to his first QF at this event since 2013. üëè <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UKChampionship?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UKChampionship</a> <a href="https://t.co/xFegG1GbMB">pic.twitter.com/xFegG1GbMB</a></p>&mdash; Live Snooker (@Livesnooker) <a href="https://twitter.com/Livesnooker/status/1466543307996254210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>Selt was unable to turn the trick this time around though, as Hawkins put together five straight frames of brilliant snooker after the break. Looking like a different player, the 42-year-old from Kent was utterly dominant as he secured his progress to the quarter finals.</p> <p>The evening‚Äôs other game was poised at 5-5 at press time. Andy Hicks battled back incredibly, not taking the lead until the ninth frame. ‚ÄòThe Cream of Devon‚Äô had momentum on his side at 5-4, but could not find the shots to beat David Gilbert. The 1995 UK Championship semi finalist had been a constant thorn in Gilbert‚Äôs side all night, managing to draw level every time the brilliantly-named ‚ÄòAngry Farmer‚Äô edged in front. </p> <p>The winner of that closely-matched battle will face Barry Hawkins in the quarter finals, as the excitement continues at the York Barbican. The winner of that will meet the winner of Zhao Xintong, who dumped out John Higgins, and Rob Lisowski.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Ronaldo's Milestone And The Weirdest Goal Ever: United And Arsenal Put On A Show</title>

<description>United's 3-2 victory over Arsenal had something for everyone, but as usual it's Ronaldo who stands tall.</description>

<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>For the first time in a long time, Manchester United and Arsenal put on the sort of game that might penetrate those Keane and Vieira era video packages that haven‚Äôt been updated since 2005. Whether it was the intoxicating glow of playing under the lights, or the fact both teams have finally declined to a level where they‚Äôre evenly-matched, this was an absolute Premier League classic. Bizarre goals, scoring milestones, pitch invaders, penalties; this game had everything. Well, everything apart from a fight in the tunnel.</p> <p>Manchester United interim manager Ralf Rangnick was at Old Trafford watching the game, and he may have allowed himself a wry smile at Arsenal‚Äôs early pressing. The German is known to favour an aggressive press, and Mikel Arteta‚Äôs men went about their work with intensity. United could barely get out of their own third, as the Gunners closed them down frequently. Gabriel Martinelli almost chased Alex Telles off the pitch at one point to win the ball back for his side.</p> <p>While Arsenal had the better of the early play, the way they went ahead at Old Trafford has to be seen to be believed. Emile Smith Rowe scored one of the most bizarre goals in Premier League history, in a moment that is sure to be debated for days to come. </p> <p>Fred accidentally trod on David De Gea‚Äôs foot as a corner came in, and the Spain stopper fell to the ground clutching the injury. The ball filtered out to Smith Rowe, who was oblivious to the empty net as he instinctively steered his shot into it. The celebrations were quickly muted, as referee Martin Atkinson checked on De Gea. A slow motion replay showed him move his whistle towards his lips as Smith Rowe shaped to shoot, but he hesitated, and the goal was scored. This lack of whistle appears to have been the pivotal factor in the goal being given, as the game had not been stopped when it was scored. A truly unprecedented way to open the scoring.</p> <p>Never one to allow himself to be overshadowed, Cristiano Ronaldo tried desperately to net his 800th career goal for club and country. After a couple of speculative early attempts went straight down Aaron Ramsdale‚Äôs throat, the Portugal international began trying to mark his milestone with something a bit special. Ronaldo twice attempted to score an overhead kick. The first attempt was deftly nodded away by Ben White, while the second went hopelessly wide as the sound of pantomime boos reverberated around the Theatre of Dreams.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/ezgifcom-webp-to-jpg24jpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p>Ronaldo‚Äôs international teammate Bruno Fernandes scored United‚Äôs equaliser on the stroke of half time. The midfielder had gone 15 games without a goal, and looked visibly galvanised as he punted the ball out of his hands in celebration. The goal was brilliantly worked, with Jadon Sancho creating space out wide and playing in Fred, who instinctively found Bruno. United‚Äôs talisman produced a tidy finish to put his side on level terms.</p> <p>The second half started at a bruising pace, with both goalkeepers having saves to make just after the break. De Gea brilliantly palmed away a Gabriel header, before Ramsdale denied Ronaldo at the near post. But was not long before the two nets were breached.</p> <p>First, Ronaldo netted for the 800th time in his breathtaking career. It was a goal that summed up the modern Cristiano. Rashford jetted up the wing in the way Ronaldo himself once did, before squaring it to the forward. Ronaldo was positioned centrally about twelve yards out to apply a finish befitting of the central striker he has become. The iconic ‚ÄúSiuuuu!‚Äù echoed around Old Trafford in recognition of the player and his outstanding achievement.</p> <p>Arsenal‚Äôs riposte was remarkably similar. Martinelli played the Rashford role, playing an enticing ball across the box. Ronaldo‚Äôs former Real Madrid colleague Martin Odegaard was the one to apply the finish, netting coolly to draw the Gunners level.</p> <p>The Norway international‚Äôs joy would soon fade, as United were awarded a penalty for his careless tackle on Fred. Ronaldo stepped up and smashed it down the middle for goal 801. On a night like this, it was no surprise the Portuguese superstar didn‚Äôt offer first refusal to his countryman Fernandes.</p> <p>As if this game had nothing memorable left to give, there was then a brief pause during an Arsenal corner as a spectator attempted to run onto the pitch and was chased down by police. These nights bring out all sorts of emotions, including idiocy.</p> <p>The five minutes of added time brought about a breathless finale. Arsenal through everything at the home side in a final frantic bid to escape with a point. United tried everything in their power to slow things down, and wave off caretaker manager Michael Carrick with a win. The home supporters did their bit to try and run the clock down, taking their time in giving the ball back when it ended up in the crowd. </p> <p>As Manchester United prepare to enter a new era, they provided a game that evoked their classic battles of the past. As far as building blocks go, Rangnick could not have asked for much better. It will be fascinating to see what he has in store for this side.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>Lisowski will meet Zhao Xintong in the quarter finals of the UK Championship.</description>

<category>Snooker</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Jack Lisowski is one of snooker‚Äôs speed merchants ‚Äì but a renowned grinder has helped him reach the UK Championship quarter-finals.The 30-year-old from Cheltenham beat Iran‚Äôs Hossein Vafaei 6-4 on Thursday to set up a quickfire shootout with China‚Äôs Zhao Xintong on Friday at the York Barbican.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">And ‚ÄòJackpot‚Äô, the world No15 chasing a first big title having lost all of his six finals to date, revealed he has been getting advice from the 2002 world champion and now retired pedestrian potter Peter Ebdon.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Lisowski said: ‚ÄúI had a chat with Peter the other day on the phone for a few hours. He gave me some things to think about, and as we know was unbelievable mentally. I was thinking about that while I was out there and so didn‚Äôt really have time to be nervous.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúIt was me that called him, I was thinking ‚ÄòWho can help me‚Äô after banging my head against a wall a bit the other week. My practice hasn‚Äôt been great after being ill and I needed dome sort of spark, so I got his number and gave him a ring.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúIt was really interesting to speak to him and he gave me some tips. I hope it‚Äôs what I needed because I feel I am doing well. The place where it is helping most is when I am sitting in the chair, rather than when I am at the table ‚Äì the mental side. That is something I have always struggled with, staying positive. And my season hadn‚Äôt been great until now.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúI hadn‚Äôt been looking at the draw for this tournament but with all the seeds going out people tell you, so I knew it was Zhao next. That won‚Äôt be dull, he is my favourite player to watch. He‚Äôll be going for everything and I probably will be as well.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúIt has been a strange old week, and because the top four are a cut above you know it‚Äôs not like playing Trump, Robertson or Selby. I don‚Äôt know why, the conditions are good and tables have been playing nice.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to believe some of the results we have seen, but I do feel I have had some luck this week and you start to wonder of maybe it‚Äôs going to be your week. Frankly I am sick of losing to Trump and Robertson in finals!</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">‚ÄúHossein had a tough last red along the cushion in the last frame ‚Äì I‚Äôd have played safe, and I think a lot of the other players would have as well.

<title>Best In The World Silva Has Proven He Is Crucial To Man Citys Title Defence</title>

<description>Everything positive about City this term has gone through Silva in the middle of the park</description>
<dc:creator>Conor Keane</dc:creator>
<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>As a thunderous volley rustled the back of the net at Villa Park on Wednesday night, Manchester City‚Äôs Bernardo Silva had not only struck the winning goal of the game against Aston Villa, but it was his fifth in the Premier League this season and it highlighted the impact he is having in the middle of the park. The Portuguese playmaker has been a shining star for the reigning champions as they look to retain their domestic crown.</p> <p>Everything positive about City this term has gone through Silva in the middle of the park where he is flourishing. What is the most surprising thing about the situation is that the midfielder looks to be loving his football following doubts over his future in the north west. The 27-year-old reportedly wanted a move away in the summer to seek a new challenge - fast forward a few months and he is 100% committed to Pep Guardiola‚Äôs cause and playing as a key component in the heart of midfield. </p> <p>There has always been plenty to admire about Silva ever since he touched down on English soil in 2017 when he joined from Monaco and he has slowly worked his way up from squad player to an invaluable asset. Most of his time at Etihad Stadium has been spent on the right side of the front three, but the individual brilliance the player possessed always suggested he would play a deeper role in the years to come. </p> <p>His composed and skilful nature was similar to that of club legend and namesake David Silva, and it always seemed that it was destiny for Bernardo to make that position his own, becoming part of the Spaniard‚Äôs legacy at City. His performances this season have been breath-taking and such a joy to watch and he will be crucial in this thrilling title race.</p> <p>His manager has been just as entertained as the rest of us, bestowing his star midfielder with the highest compliment. After City‚Äôs victory over Aston Villa, Guardiola insisted: ‚ÄúHe is the best [in the Premier League].</p> <p>‚ÄúHe was the best two or three seasons ago. He was the best then too. He has a special ability to do whatever he wants with the ball. Against a good goalkeeper [Emiliano Martinez] it was an incredible finish.</p> <p>‚ÄúYou have to go back to when we won with 98 points, review the videos, you will see the same player like this right now.‚Äù</p> <figure class="op-interactive"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">WHAT A FINISH üî•<br><br>Bernardo Silva hammers a volley home to double Man City&#39;s lead!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PLonPrime?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PLonPrime</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AVLMCI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AVLMCI</a> <a href="https://t.co/tyhTiJGQQP">pic.twitter.com/tyhTiJGQQP</a></p>&mdash; Amazon Prime Video Sport (@primevideosport) <a href="https://twitter.com/primevideosport/status/1466150341213364230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </figure> <p>It was also a particularly a special night for Guardiola who recorded his 150th Premier League victory, becoming the fastest manager to reach the milestone, taking just 204 games. As people continue to question City‚Äôs strength without a traditional number nine to lead the line, Guardiola‚Äôs side continue to excel with only Liverpool and Chelsea scoring more than their total of 29 goals. </p> <p>Silva is currently the Citizens‚Äô top scorer and he also boasts some impressive stats in which he ranks top in the club. The midfield maestro has attempted the most dribbles (38), which is not at all surprising because he is so gifted with the ball at his feet that it may as well be glued to him. He is also the player who has covered the most distance for City with an impressive 148.2km. Silva ranks second in the club stats for interceptions (7) and duels won (63) which shows just how much his game has evolved since he was given the responsibility and freedom to play deeper.</p> <p>From the first 14 games this season, no player has stood out more than Silva than Mohamed Salah, but both have just as strong an influence on their sides, with both proving time and again to be the difference makers as the title race ratchets up over the festive period.</p> <p>It takes a collective effort to win a Premier League title, especially in this competitive era with an abundance of quality on show, but a player of Silva‚Äôs ilk could prove to be the difference in a race as tight as this because there is simply no doubting he is one of the best in the world.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/bernsiljpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> ]]></content:encoded>

<title>Brendan Rodgers Needs To Utilise Kelechi Iheanacho Over Busy Festive Period</title>

<description>The Nigerian striker has played just 438 minutes of Premier League football this season</description>

<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Leicester City have suffered a lot of turbulence in the Premier League this season and it might be time for them to introduce some more attacking players into the side ahead of the chaotic winter schedule to help them convert more draws into wins.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">On Wednesday night they had to come from behind twice to earn a point against Southampton at St Mary‚Äôs in what was their fifth stalemate in 14 matches in the top-flight, and it is something that Brendan Rodgers will need to address quickly if his team are to match or eclipse last year‚Äôs incredible campaign. The manager has to only look at his bench for solutions where he has players who can make a difference.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">They are blessed with plenty of talent in their ranks, especially in the forward areas. Star striker and icon of Leicester Jamie Vardy is a great of the Premier League era, as his incredible goal record shows. Summer signing Patson Daka hasn‚Äôt been in the East Midlands for half a year and yet is already the club‚Äôs record goalscorer in European competition.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Then there is Kelechi Iheanacho, who lit up the King Power Stadium in the second half of last season with an abundance of goals, and yet has found himself exiled from the starting lineup for the most part this season.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/Iheanachogoaljpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">The Nigerian striker will be frustrated with his lack of game time this term, especially with the Foxes not being able to hunt as successfully as they did in 2020-21, and it was his flurry of goals during the latter half of the campaign that kept them in the race for a Champions League spot. From February 2021, Iheanacho contributed 12 goals in the top-flight as Rodgers‚Äô side narrowly missed out on a return to Europe's premiere tournament on the last day of the season.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Not only did the 25-year-old develop into a lethal attacking threat in the league, he was also Leicester‚Äôs FA Cup hero who inspired them to the final. Although Youri Tielemans was the cup-winner against Chelsea at Wembley Stadium, Leicester would not have been there had it not been for Iheanacho‚Äôs goals in the previous rounds.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">Iheanacho scored four of Leicester‚Äôs 13 FA Cup goals last year, amounting to 30%. The striker was in the form of his life earlier this year. He even scored the decisive goal as Leicester stunned champions and his former employers Manchester City in the Community Shield in August. For many people, the exiling of one of the club‚Äôs biggest attacking threats has been a conundrum in 2021-22, and many fans want to see Rodgers utilising the player more in the league, as they look to build on their incredible finish in the previous campaign.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">In the 14 matches that Leicester have played in the Premier League so far, Iheanacho has only been on the pitch for 438 minutes (five starts) and has just a solitary goal to his name. And after the performance of veteran Vardy last night, in which he squandered a great chance in on the south coast, fans have called for him to be rested and for Iheanacho to come back into the fold.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">The Foxes surprisingly haven‚Äôt struggled for goals as they have registered 22 already, with only the top four sides having outscored them. But, when Iheanacho‚Äôs contributions had a great impact on results last term, Rodgers‚Äô side need their goals to count for more than they currently are. With the busy festive period approaching, Leicester need to remain in the hunt for the European places and Rodgers can‚Äôt rely on Vardy to be full of his usual energy with these eight games between now and New Year‚Äôs Day coming thick and fast.</p> <p style="margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm">With five draws already in the league, it might be time for a fresh approach and some fresh faces. It‚Äôs time for the Northern Irishman to let Iheanacho off the leash and allow him to rediscover his golden touch in front of goal as it will only bolster Leicester‚Äôs chances of having another fruitful season.</p> ]]></content:encoded>

<description>Five players have played for both Manchester United and Arsenal in the Premier League era.</description>
<dc:creator>Joey Mills</dc:creator>
<category>Football</category>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>As Manchester United and Arsenal prepare to meet in the Premier League on Thursday, there is much that connects the two clubs. There is the memory of those titanic Premier League title tussles in the 90s and 00s, and there is a shared recent decline as Manchester City and Liverpool have usurped their former place atop English football. Something else the sides share is five players who have represented both clubs during the Premier League era. Here is a rundown of each player to have gone from Gunner to Devil, or vice versa. (Author‚Äôs note: Andy Cole has been omitted as his sole Arsenal appearance came in the old First Division).</p> <p><strong>Mikael Silvestre</strong></p> <p>Moving between these two giants was just not something you did back in 2008. Memories of Keane vs Vieira, of United controversially ending Arsenal‚Äôs unbeaten run and of pitched battles for league and cup silverware were too fresh.</p> <p>French defender Silvestre became the first to make the move, 16 years after the Premier League was first established. The player reportedly turned down Manchester City when Arsene Wenger came calling, a deal that would have come with its own complications. What was clear when Silvestre pitched up in north London was that, after over 300 games at United, there was not much of his peak left for Arsenal to enjoy. Silvestre only managed 26 league games over the course of two seasons before being released.</p> <p><strong>Robin van Persie</strong></p> <p>The most successful move on this list, the Dutchman was criticised by Gunner‚Äôs supporters for ‚Äúlisten(ing) to the little boy inside‚Äù him by swapping the Emirates for Old Trafford. He became a pariah to Arsenal fans, but his choice was vindicated when his 26 goals fired United to their 20th league title, their last as it stands.</p> <p>As with many modern United stars, he was a victim of the flux the club fell into after Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013. Solid but unspectacular seasons under David Moyes and Louis van Gaal saw him moved on in 2015.</p> <figure> <img src="https://www.thesportsman.com/media/images/admin/football/original/DaU7jLhWkAEbgLijpg.jpg" alt=""> </figure> <p><strong>Danny Welbeck</strong></p> <p>Seen as a real coup at the time, getting the England striker for ¬£16 million looked like astute business from Wenger. While he was not a total flop, Welbeck flattered to deceive in Arsenal red, and never quite lived up to the hype.</p> <p>Injuries played their part, and Welbeck‚Äôs highest league goals total was five in the 2017/18 season. After five seasons that promised much but delivered only occasional brilliance, the former Sunderland loanee‚Äôs contract was allowed to expire. After a whistle-stop spell at Watford, he now plays for Brighton & Hove Albion.</p> <p><strong>Alexis Sanchez</strong></p> <p>If Welbeck was a mild disappointment, Sanchez was an absolute disaster. Unveiled from behind a piano in a video that has become the punchline to jokes about overwrought transfers announcements, the viral clip was the most memorable thing Sanchez did in a United shirt.</p> <p>The ex-Barcelona forward had been Arsenal‚Äôs crown jewel for three-and-a-half seasons, but he had played his last worthwhile Premier League football when he arrived at Old Trafford. Sanchez has since said he wanted to leave during his first training session, and he certainly played as if that was the case. The Chile international scored just five goals in 45 games for United, before leaving on loan to Inter Milan in a deal that became permanent.</p> <p><strong>Henrikh Mkhitaryan</strong></p> <p>The other-half of the swap deal that took Sanchez to United, Mkhitaryan fared a little better than his counterpart. That‚Äôs still not saying a lot, as his struggles in adapting to the English game at Old Trafford seemed to accompany him. </p> <p>Injuries blighted a promising second campaign at the Emirates, and he barely featured in his third before departing to Roma on loan. Like Sanchez, Serie A has proved to be his salvation, as he‚Äôs been largely impressive in the Italian capital. The struggles of the two players involved in this deal make it perhaps the most doomed transfer in history.</p> <p><a href="https://www.betfred.com/sports/event/21313692.2">Arsenal are 11/4 to beat Man United with Betfred*</a></p> <p>*<em>18+ | BeGambleAware</em></p> ]]></content:encoded>
