      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Schools have been warned to protect student privacy after an attempt by a “gender critical” group in New Zealand to compile information on trans school kids.</h3>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/127150837/schools-warned-as-gender-critical-group-seeks-information-on-trans-students" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Stuff</em></a>, an email addressed to “all intermediate and secondary schools” was brought to the attention of New Zealand’s Ministry of Education by schools.</p>
<p>It describes being transgender as a “new trend”, and asks for information from schools on their <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/transgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trans</a> and non-binary students.</p>
<p>The group asked how many trans kids were enrolled at each school, and requested information on their year group, ethnicity and correspondence with the school before enrolment.</p>
<p>It also asked <span style="color: var(--bs-body-color); font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family); font-size: var(--bs-body-font-size); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); background-color: var(--bs-body-bg);">“what, if any, problems” trans kids posed for the schools, and what “actions that would support schools in managing this new trend”.</span></p>
<p>Lorraine Monahan, the Ministry of Education’s official information manager, told the publication: “We would be very concerned about the release of any information which might identify students or breach their privacy.”</p>
<p>She said that while there was technically nothing wrong with the group sending the emails, schools should ask for advice before releasing information, for example from the New Zealand School Trustees Association or Te Rūnanga Nui.</p>
<p>Margaret Curnow, one of the “gender critical” people behind the emails, told <em>Stuff</em> the group had “growing concerns” about sex and relationships education in New Zealand schools, especially in light of new guidelines released by the government last year.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://health.tki.org.nz/Teaching-in-Heath-and-Physical-Education-HPE/Policy-Guidelines/Relationships-and-Sexuality-Education" target="_blank" rel="noopener">guidelines</a> include advice on being inclusive of trans and non-binary pupils, for example allowing them <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/11/log-cabin-republicans-tennessee-anti-trans-bathroom-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to use the correct toilets</a>, and not dividing classes into “girls” and “boys” groups.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Curnow said she thought the guidelines encouraged schools to “set up policies and practices that put the needs of trans children ahead of the needs of other children”.</p>
<p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph">But Dr Rachael Dixon, co-chair of NZ Health Education Association and part of the team that developed the guidelines, was clear: “There is no evidence anywhere in the world that education about gender would cause someone to change their gender identity.”</p>
<p>She added: “Young people know about this stuff… They want to talk about it, they want teachers who are able to open up this conversation in a safe and inclusive way.</p>
<p class="sics-component__html-injector sics-component__story__paragraph">“Young people are accepting of difference.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>An anti-LGBT+ hate group has asked the US Supreme Court to allow it to sue the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) to overturn its hate group status.</h3>
<p>D James Kennedy Ministries, also known as Coral Ridge Ministries Media, is an evangelical Christian media organisation, founded in 1974, which broadcasts a weekly TV show.</p>
<p>The organisation has long been fighting its hate group <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hate-map?state=FL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designation from the SPLC</a>, which monitors extremism across the US.</p>
<p>In 2019, a US district court <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/09/24/hate-group-anti-lgbt-church-southern-poverty-law-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dismissed a defamation lawsuit</a> from D James Kennedy Ministries, ruling it was legal on free speech grounds for it to be labelled a hate group by SPLC.</p>
<p>The Florida-based evangelical organisation also tried to file a religious discrimination claim against Amazon, which had banned it from participating in Amazon Smile, its charity partner programme, because of its hate group status. This claim was also rejected.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, D James Kennedy Ministries tried to fight the ruling, but <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/29/d-james-kennedy-ministries-hate-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its appeal was also struck down. </a></p>
<p>Now, it is taking its case to the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>According to a press release from <em>Christian Newswire</em>, D James Kennedy Ministries submitted its brief to the Supreme Court on 24 November.</p>
<p>It asks the court to reconsider the precedent set by its decision in <em>New York Times v Sullivan, </em>a case which set a high bar for “public figures” in defamation cases, requiring them to prove intended malice.</p>
<p>Dr Frank Wright, televangelist and CEO of D James Kennedy ministries, said in statement: “That gives reputational terrorists like the SPLC carte blanche to attack and destroy its ideological enemies.</p>
<p>“We are asking the Court to give us and similarly situated ministries and individuals the ability to bring a claim for reputational harm that is currently denied under <em>Sullivan</em>.”</p>
<p>Following the ministry’s failed appeal earlier this year, SPLC president Richard Cohen described the case as “meritless”.</p>
<p>He said: “We list the D James Kennedy Ministries through which Coral Ridge does business as a hate group because it maligns the entire LGBT community, portraying it as perverted and a threat to the nation.”</p>
<h2>The CEO of anti-LGBT+ hate group D James Kennedy Ministries once compared same-sex marriage to ‘marrying a Volkswagen’</h2>
<p>Although D James Kennedy Ministries has repeatedly refuted its hate group status, it certainly has a hateful history when it comes to the LGBT+ community.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the ministry’s CEO Frank Wright said during a livestream: “The destruction of marriage isn’t really about sexuality, it’s a left-wing idea, it’s a Marxist, socialist idea… destruction of the family [is] step one for overturning the government […] or any form of democracy.”</p>
<p>He then went on to <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/03/24/evangelical-homophobe-marriage-equality-volkswagen-frank-wright/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compared marriage equality to tying the knot with a car</a>.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Wright said: “I hate to break it to them, but many of our gay and lesbian friends, they’ve just been used by the left to destroy the historic definition of marriage and changed the criteria to only be that of love.</p>
<p>“If two people love each other, or some guy and his Volkswagen, he loves his Volkswagen, he ought to be able to marry his Volkswagen.”</p>
<p>The organisation has <a href="https://rumble.com/vn0tuv-is-the-church-caving.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed conversion therapy</a>, and recently,<a href="https://rumble.com/vpi946-a-grateful-heart.html?fbclid=IwAR2K9Ig7ba1LqrVdp8A22c2RhneNBSbyfedjyh7NhpCxdV8P5YCxd04fvyY" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> over Thanksgiving</a>, Wright said that people only “feel” oppressed on the basis of their “sex, sexual preference, gender identity and skin colour” because they aren’t “thankful” enough. Wright has also <a href="https://rumble.com/vfp269-undoing-the-fabric-of-gods-creation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that trans people are “undoing the very fabric of God’s creation”.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>When Sabrina Prater posted a simple dancing video to TikTok, she could never have known that within weeks she would be at the centre of a transphobic serial killer conspiracy theory.</h3>
<p>Prater, a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/transgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trans</a> woman, had been posting dancing videos to <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/15/disney-lgbt-tiktok-text-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok</a>, like millions of other users, for a few months.</p>
<p>But for some reason, one video of her dancing the kitchen of a dilapidated house went viral.</p>
<p>The video became meme, with users writing captions like “when you’re the last person to leave a party”, but light-hearted jokes soon became much darker.</p>
<p>TikTok users began scrutinising all of Prater’s videos, branding them “creepy” and picking out details as “evidence” of a bizarre and completely baseless conspiracy – that she was a serial killer.</p>
<p>The theory spread like wildfire across the app and beyond, with thousands of TikToks, as well as multiple Facebook groups and sub-Reddits, analysing Prater’s posts and hurling horrific accusations.</p>
<p>Social media users speculated that a computer monitor seen in the background of some videos showed photos of her “victims”, that water visible on the floor was “blood”, and some even began trying to link her to missing persons cases in her local area of Flint, Michigan.</p>
<p>The viral conspiracy also began to have dangerous real-world consequences, as TikTok users began reporting Prater to the police, and even doxxing her by sharing her address online.</p>
<p>Abbie Richards, a conspiracy theory expert and TikTok researcher, told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/tiktok-true-crime-conspiracy-theory-fake-1264687/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>: “[It was] like watching true crime, internet sleuthing, conspiracy theories, and transphobia collide in a horrific car crash.”</p>
<h2>Sabrina Prater is ‘sick of being hurt’ by the groundless conspiracy theory</h2>
<p>The conspiracy theory spread so rapidly that Sabrina Prater was actually forced to defend herself online, despite there being zero evidence of wrongdoing, telling viewers in a livestream that she is “not a serial killer”.</p>
<p>She also explained that the house she had filmed the videos in was currently being renovated, and that images on her computer screen were of her children.</p>
<p>In a now-deleted video, she appeared tearful, and said: “I didn’t do nothing wrong. I’m sick of being hurt by this. I’m just like anybody else.</p>
<p>“I want to be loved and accepted, man. And I’m not. I’m getting treated worse than anybody coming out like me.”</p>
<p>Luckily, the accusations against Prater seem to have slowed. Some TikTok users are even posting apology videos for promoting the serial killer conspiracy theory, and Prater has not been dissuaded from continuing to post dancing videos.</p>
<p>But her horrific treatment is indicative of a society that treats trans women as dangerous and scary.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Boxer Irma Testa, who took home a bronze medal for Italy at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, has come out as queer.</h3>
<p>Testa, 23, won a bronze medal in the women’s featherweight category at this year’s <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/14/lgbt-athletes-tokyo-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">summer Olympics</a>, after previously competing in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.</p>
<p>The boxer, who also won gold at the 2019 European Championships, explained in an interview with <a href="https://www.vanityfair.it/article/irma-testa-coming-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Vanity Fair Italia</em></a> that her Olympic success gave her the confidence to publicly come out.</p>
<p>She said: “The people who are close to me have known for years but I think it is right to tell everyone now.</p>
<p>“Speaking of sexual orientation in the world of sport has a special value, because champions are expected to be perfect. And for many homosexuality is still an imperfection.</p>
<p>“Many athletes stay silent and hide away for fear of damaging their image. For me, too, it was like that up to a few months ago.”</p>
<p>But Testa said that her Tokyo medal had become her “shield”, and added: “Now that Irma the athlete is secure, Irma the woman can be sincere.”</p>
<p>She said that being open about her sexuality now was “fundamental” because she wanted to stand up for queer people who are not as “protected and safe” as she is.</p>

<p>Testa continued: “There are people who suffer from discrimination, who are bullied, who are unable to build a life for themselves because they do not know how to relate to a society that is hostile to them.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“There are still too many people discriminated against and this is not good. I can’t do much, but I can, by telling the truth about myself, say that nothing is wrong [with being LGBT+].”</p>
<p>Testa said she did not want to assign a label to her sexual orientation, but added that she feels “relieved” to have publicly come out.</p>
<p>“It’s like I have always wanted to say to people who told me about their stories so similar to mine: ‘I understand you perfectly, I too am like you.'”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Prepare for your heart to be melted. A Colorado mother has shared the creative way her trans son came out to her and it’s the most adorable thing ever.</h3>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/CherieAmours">Cherie Garcia</a>, of Centennial, recently a shared a tweet with a photograph of a ransom-style note her trans son handed to her in an envelope with the request that she didn’t read it until he had left the house.</p>
<p>“Congatulations!” the letter reads, “You are now the proud owner of your very own son. Please use he/him pronouns for me now.”</p>
<p>Garcia explains in the tweet that she got in touch with her son after reading the letter to ensure he knew she accepted him – and to poke fun at his unfortunate spelling mistake.</p>
<p>“After opening it, I called to let him know that the *only* thing that’s wrong with this is the ‘r’ he accidentally left out of congratulations.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">My teenager handed me this envelope and asked that I wait to open it until after he went to his dad’s house.

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The tweet has now been liked nearly 25,000 times with many other parents of trans children congratulating the mother and son, and <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/12/01/elliot-page-trans-coming-out-transmasculine/">sharing their own experiences</a>.</p>

<p>In subsequent tweets, Garcia continued to emphasise her acceptance of her trans son. “There is nothing my kids could do to lose my support and unconditional love. My prayer for each of them is that they live life as their authentic selves, without compromise. My teen is figuring things out and I support him 100 per cent, because God created both of my babies perfectly.”</p>
<p>If anything, it seems the contents of the letter turned out to be something of a relief for the mother.</p>
<p>“I walked by his room before he gave it to me and I happened to be on the phone with his dad (we’re divorced). Dad asked how Crow was doing and I said, ‘They’re either working on homework or holding someone ransom.’</p>
<p>“I was relieved that it wasn’t the latter when I opened the envelope,” Garcia jokingly confessed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Suspects in the murder of a gay member of the ‘Ndrangheta crime syndicate will be in the dock at one of the biggest Mafia trials in Italy’s history.</h3>
<p>The trial will specifically target the Mancuso family, one of the most powerful families in the ‘Ndrangheta criminal network. The syndicate is Italy’s richest and most powerful, controls most of Europe’s cocaine and is based in Calabria.</p>
<p><span style="text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); background-color: var(--bs-body-bg);"><span style="font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);"><span style="color: var(--bs-body-color);">In 2019, 355 ‘Ndrangheta members and </span></span>collaborators<span style="font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);"><span style="color: var(--bs-body-color);"> were </span></span><a style="color: var(--bs-body-color); font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/19/italian-politicians-and-police-among-300-held-in-historic-mafia-bust" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arrested</a><span style="font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);"><span style="color: var(--bs-body-color);"> and charged in an operation that </span></span>involved<span style="font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);"><span style="color: var(--bs-body-color);"> 2,500 </span></span>military<span style="font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family);"><span style="color: var(--bs-body-color);"> police officers. </span></span></span></p>

<p>The trial began in January and, earlier this month, testimony from an incredible 58 Mafia informants ended.</p>
<p>The hundreds of defendants will now make their way to the dock as part of the “maxi-trial”, appearing on screens in a huge repurposed emergency bunker.</p>
<p>The trial will take at least another year, according to <a href="https://www.thelocal.it/20210111/italy-prepares-for-mafia-maxi-trial-with-355-defendants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AFP</em></a>, with 900 witnesses and 400 lawyers involved. At one hearing, it took three hours to simply read the names of the accused.</p>
<p>Defendants are accused of a vast range of crimes, including intimidation, vote-buying, drug trafficking, extortion, bribing judges, forging medical certificates, storing weapons and corporate fraud, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Five murder cases will also go to trial, one of which is the murder of gay Mafia member <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/12/23/mafia-gay-italy-hitman-murdered-cousin-ndrangheta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filippo Gangitano</a> in 2002.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Powerful member-turned-informant Andrea Mantella is one of those who testified in court, and who has said he is responsible for arranging the death of Gangitano, his cousin.</p>
<p>When Gangitano, who had himself committed multiple murders, began living with a male partner, <a href="https://www.blmagazine.it/mafia-omosessualita-e-disonore-lomicidio-di-filippo-gangitano/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mantella said</a> the ‘Ndrangheta “could not tolerate” the “disgrace” of a member being openly gay.</p>
<p>Mantella maintains that he tried to convince Mafia bosses to have Gangitano expelled rather than killed, but his request was rejected, and as his cousin Mantella had to be the one to arrange the murder.</p>
<p>He invited Gangitano to a farm, he confessed, before having him shot. His body was placed in an animal feed sack and buried, before later being covered in tarmac.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Lewis Hamilton has spoken out against Saudi Arabia’s anti-LGBT+ laws which he described as ‘terrifying’.</h3>
<p>The Formula One star took pole for the country’s inaugural Grand Prix on Friday (December 3). But speaking to <em><a href="https://news.sky.com/story/lewis-hamilton-condemns-saudi-arabias-terrifying-lgbtq-laws-ahead-of-race-and-says-it-is-not-my-choice-to-be-here-12484987">Sky Sports</a></em> ahead of the historic race in Jeddah, the driver condemned the country’s homophobic laws which include the death penalty for acts of homosexuality.</p>
<p>“There’s prison time, death penalty and restrictions from people for being themselves, and I don’t believe in that,” Hamilton said. “Religions can change, rules can change, rulers can change those things. They have the power to.”</p>
<p>Hamilton also made note to emphasise he was not in the country by his own choice but rather because of his Formula One commitments.</p>
<p>“We don’t choose where we’re going, others have chosen for us to be here, so we have to apply the pressure on them to make sure that they are doing right by the people in those places, sparking conversations, creating that uncomfortable discussion that is needed in these places,” he explained.</p>
<p>“Do I feel comfortable here? I wouldn’t say that I do.</p>
<p>“But it’s not my choice to be here. The sport has taken the choice to be here.”</p>
<p>Lewis Hamilton made headlines last month after he wore a bespoke helmet designed by <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/06/07/progress-pride-flag-intersex-flag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British intersex artist Valentino Vecchietti</a>, which features the LGBT+ Progress flag, and is also emblazoned with the words “We Stand Together” and “Love Is Love”.</p>

<p>Hamilton, Formula One’s most successful driver of all time and the only Black driver in the series’ history, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/21/lewis-hamilton-lgbt-saudi-arabia-uae-f1/">later confirmed he intended to wear the helmet throughout the Grand Prix</a> as it travelled throughout the Middle East.</p>
<p>The racing legend also took a moment to speak out against women’s rights in the country, saying: “There’s changes that need to be made. For example women’s rights of being able to drive [legally] in 2018, it’s how they are policed. Some of the women are still in prison from driving many, many years ago.</p>
<p>“So there’s a lot of changes that need to happen and I think our sport needs to do more.”</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>The Formula One series has faced major backlash for holding Grand Prix races in Middle Eastern countries due to the their abhorrent stances on LGBT+ rights and other human rights issues.</p>
<p>However, also speaking to <em>Sky Sports</em>, Formula Oneboss Stefano Domenicali argued that the series’ presence in these countries casts a global spotlight on their antiquated laws, thus acting as a catalyst for change.</p>
<p>“As soon as these countries choose to be under the spotlight Formula One is bringing, there is no excuse.</p>
<p>“They have taken the route of a change.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now, in a touching video shared on Twitter by <em>Openly</em>, you can watch the immediate aftermath of members of Botswana’s LGBT+ community hearing the news and celebrating this historic win.</p>
<p>In the video, which has been shared nearly 2,000 times, people can be seen rejoicing, waving flags and cheering at the result. Others seem overcome with emotion, embracing each other in floods of tears.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Announcing the court’s unanimous decision, Court of Appeal judge president Ian Kirby said sections of the penal code banning same-sex relations “have outlived their usefulness, and serve only to incentivise law enforcement agents to become key-hole peepers and intruders into the private space of citizens”.</p>
<p>Prior to the 2019 decriminalisation, homosexuality had been banned in the country since 1965 and offenders could face up to seven years in prison if caught engaging in homosexual acts.</p>
<p>Botswana is one of only a handful of African countries to have decriminalised homosexuality including South Africa, Mozambique, the Seychelles, Angola and Gabon.</p>
<p>It remains to be outlawed in a majority of African countries including Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Kenya, Ghana, Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria and Sudan.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Earlier this week the Ghanaian <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/29/botswana-gay-sex-lgbt/">human rights group Rightify Ghana described the ruling as a “huge win”.</a></p>
<p>“A huge win for the LGBTQ community in Botswana, as the country’s Court of Appeal has upheld a 2018 ruling, decriminalising consensual same-sex relationships,” the group said on Twitter.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to the LGBTQ community, especially activists and those who led this good fight.”</p>
<p>Sethunya Mosime, chair of the Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO), also commented on the community’s victory, telling <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/botswana-appeals-court-upholds-ruling-that-decriminalised-gay-sex-2021-11-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a>: “This will forever change the landscape of democracy, human rights and equality in Botswana.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Jennifer Coolidge has opened up about her love for the LGBT+ community and why the gays are “obsessed” with her.</h3>
<p>The legendary actor quickly became a beloved icon within the queer community after starring in several camp films including the <em>Legally Blonde</em> franchise, <em>A Cinderella Story</em> and <em>Best in Show</em>. Recently, she spoke to the <a href="https://www.avclub.com/jennifer-coolidge-on-why-shes-always-attracted-gay-fans-1848131685" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>AV Club</em></a> about her role as the wonderfully wacky aunt Sandy in the new gay Netflix holiday romcom <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/10/jennifer-coolidge-single-all-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Single All the Way</em></a>.</p>
<p>In the movie, Coolidge’s character (correctly) declared that the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/gay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gays</a> are “all obsessed with me” – which is honestly accurate given the <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a38420939/netflix-christmas-rom-com-single-all-the-way-fan-reaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stellar reviews Coolidge’s performance in the movie has gotten from fans</a>.</p>
<p>Coolidge admitted in her interview with <em>the AV Club</em> that obsession and love have always been a “mutual thing” that she was “never conscious of” because it was “just the people I was attracted to”.</p>
<p>“It just started from a very young age,” Coolidge explained. “I don’t think when you’re young, you’re very conscious of any decision you make.”</p>
<p>She continued: “You go with what you’re attracted to.</p>
<p>“I think that’s really what most of our youth is, and that’s just what I was attracted to in all my friends.”</p>

<p>Coolidge explained that many of her friends, who hadn’t “figured it out at the time” when they were young, were part of the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/lgbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBT</a>+ community. She added that she developed a following with “all the gay men and all the gay women in my town, at my school or at camp”.</p>
<p>Kathy Najimy, Coolidge’s <em>Single All the Way</em> co-star and a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/queer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">queer</a> icon in her own right, added that the “gays have good taste” in the interview.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“They really do,” Coolidge agreed.</p>
<p>In a separate interview with <a href="https://toofab.com/2021/12/01/jennifer-coolidge-single-all-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>too fab</em></a>, Najimy – who starred in cult classics <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/hocus-pocus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Hocus Pocus</em></a>, <em>Sister Act</em> and <em>Veronica’s Closet</em> – added she has been an LGBT+ ally and activist since she was a teenager.</p>
<p>“I think I forced my way into the gay community, demanding that they like me,” Najimy joked. “But I think both Jennifer and I in a slight way represent the outside circles… Equality is very important to me.”</p>
<p><em>Single All the Way</em> follows two best friends – Peter (Michael Urie) and Nick (Philemon Chambers) – who pretend they’re in a relationship while visiting family for the holidays. The film is now available on Netflix.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Actor Hugo Weaving, who starred in the 1994 cult film <em>The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, </em>has explained why the main cast were all straight men.</h3>
<p>The Australian film follows two drag queens and a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/transgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trans</a> woman travelling across the Australian outback, and has been praised for bringing positive <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/lgbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBT</a>+ representation to mainstream cinema.</p>
<p>But all three of the <em>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert’s</em> protagonists were played by straight, cisgender men.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-10275675/Hugo-Weaving-no-gay-actors-starred-Adventures-Priscilla-Queen-Desert.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Stellar</em></a> magazine, Weaving said that writer and director Stephan Elliott struggled to find LGBT+ actors to take on the roles.</p>
<p>He said: “In fact, Stephan approached a number of gay actors – not that you have to be gay to play a drag queen – but they didn’t want to be playing those roles.”</p>
<p>Weaving also waded into the debate on straight actors in queer roles, insisting he thought it was “nonsense”.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">“There’s an insanity about the casting – the whole idea of acting is to understand the ‘other’,” he said.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">“Actors perform a role, which is to illuminate the other – not to illuminate themselves.”</p>
<p>But many disagree with Weaving, believing that LGBT+ roles should go to LGBT+ actors, who are less represented in the industry and who are able to truly understand the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/queer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">queer</a> experience.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/30/single-all-the-way-michael-urie-netflix-gay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michael Urie told <em>PinkNews</em></a> why it was so important that gay actors be cast as gay characters in his new queer Christmas film <em>Single All The Way</em>.</p>
<p>He said: “I don’t have any real power, but I was very clear that we need to make sure the other guys are really gay.</p>
<p>“I was like, it’s gonna be a lot easier in a year when I’m on Zoom doing junkets if we can speak authentically about our gay experience.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“It’s going to be a lot easier than tiptoeing around the fact that my co-star, who I spend the entire movie falling in love with, doesn’t know what it’s like to be in love with a man.”</p>
<p>Urie added that if a straight person plays a queer role “then the narrative is all like, ‘You were <em>so </em>convincing!’”</p>
<p>“Come on, give me a break,” he said. “We’ve done that, we’re tired of that, we don’t need that anymore.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>We all dream of one day living out our movie-style happy ending moment – but this Californian couple actually managed to do it.</h3>
<p>YouTuber Cammie Scott recently made her girlfriend’s dreams a reality when she <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/07/trans-football-kumi-yokoyama-propose/">proposed</a> to her in an elaborate recreation of the iconic marching band scene in 90s teen rom-com <em>10 Things I Hate About You.</em></p>
<p>In the well-remembered scene, Heath Ledger’s character Patrick convinces Julia Stiles’ Kat to go on a date with him with the help of the high school’s marching band in a show-stopping number on the football field.</p>
<p>Ledger went on to be nominated for Best Musical Performance at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards for his work in the scene.</p>
<p>To pop the question, Scott led her now-fiancé and podcaster Taryn Arnold to centre of the field in the Banc of California Stadium in Los Angeles. As their friends and family watched from the bleachers, Arnold’s attention was drawn to the stadium’s big screens which began to show a supercut of the <em>10 Things I Hate About You </em>scene and videos from her and Scott’s relationship – soundtracked by the classic “Can’t Take My Eyes Off Of You” from the movie.</p>
<p>“She loves rom-coms,” Scott explained to <em><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/nbc-out-proud/woman-re-creates-10-things-hate-scene-propose-girlfriend-rcna7375">TODAY</a>.</em> “And she has always said that scene where Heath Ledger is dancing in the bleachers professing his love to Julia Stiles is one of her favourite scenes from any movie.”</p>
<p>Scott explained that the grand gesture probably didn’t come as a total surprise to Arnold as the pair had already picked out rings together and agreed on a time frame in which to propose to each other, with Scott agreeing to go first.</p>
<p class="">“We knew that the rings being a surprise wasn’t really important to us,” Scott said. “We wanted the surprise to be how it was done, and Taryn always had the desire to be proposed to, and I had more of the desire to do the proposing.”</p>

<p class="">“I was like 70 per cent ready for a proposal at all times in the last, like, couple months,” Arnold told <em>TODAY</em>. “I feel like every time we do anything, whether it was like some event or we’re going to dinner or we’re seeing friends or family, I’m just positive it’s going to happen.

<p class="">“This is the thing that I thought no one would actually ever do for me,” Arnold said. “It was just a dumb thing I used to say, and then when she did it, I was like, ‘Oh my God, this cannot be a mistake. It is happening.’”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Lauren Ashley Smith recalled the surprising interaction she had with a catcaller who has no issue harassing women – but he tries to draw the line at homophobia.</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hbo.com/a-black-lady-sketch-show"><em>A Black Lady Sketch Show</em></a> star went viral on Twitter after she shared information about the creepy incident she experienced with her wife on Monday (20 November).</p>
<p>The queer comic wrote: “Earlier this AM, my wife and I were walking our dog and got catcalled. The man said, ‘Don’t you ladies walk by looking like that!’</p>
<p>“Then he realised we were holding hands and clarified with, ‘Y’all can hold hands! Just don’t look that good!’ He didn’t wanna seem homophobic. I’m [dead]”.</p>

<p>Naturally, her followers couldn’t help but laugh at the mystery man’s bizarre attempt to appear respectful while still harassing the two women.</p>
<p>One Twitter user replied: “Not a woke harasser omg.”</p>
<p>Another commented: “People are now trying to be respectfully disrespectful?”</p>

<p>The couple’s experience comes amid <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/17/idahobit-lesbian-lesphobia-homophobia-linda-riley-diva-magazine/">continued conversations about the experience of lesbians</a> and how their sex lives are fetishised by the straight male gaze.</p>
<p>Indeed, lesbians have recently been physically assaulted for failing to “perform” in front of heterosexual men as they continue to face the double whammy of prejudice against their sex and their sexual preferences.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Demi Lovato has confirmed on their Instagram Stories they no longer practise a “California sober” approach to sobriety.</h3>
<p>“I no longer support my ‘California sober’ ways,” the singer wrote. “Sober sober is the only way to be.”</p>
<p>The former Disney star, who survived an opioid overdose in 2018, detailed their experiences with drug abuse and their road to recovery in the four-part YouTube documentary <em>Dancing with the Devil </em>earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the final episode of the series, the singer revealed they were not entirely sober and had began smoking weed and “drinking in moderation”.</p>

<p>“Telling myself I can never have a drink or smoke marijuana, I feel like that’s setting myself up for failure because I am such a black and white thinker,” Demi Lovato explained in the documentary.</p>
<p>“I had it drilled into my head for so many years that one drink was equivalent to a crack pipe.</p>
<p>“I don’t want people to hear that and think that they can go out and try just having a drink or smoking a joint because it isn’t for everybody. Recovery isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution and you shouldn’t be forced to get sober if you’re not ready. You shouldn’t get sober for other people, you have to do it for yourself.”</p>
<p>The “Sorry Not Sorry” hitmaker, who was recently<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlwMh0IWgX4"> spotted out clubbing until the early hours with YouTuber Tana Mongeau</a>, confessed at the time they were hesitant to publicly admit to not living a hundred per cent sober lifestyle.</p>
<p>“After nearly dying of the OD and after so many years of being the poster child of sobriety, I didn’t want people to criticise me for that,” they said.</p>
<p>In the documentary, Lovato’s friends, family and mentors expressed concern and in some cases disapproval over their approach to sobriety, with Elton John saying: “Moderation doesn’t work. Sorry.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“If you drink, you’re going to drink more. If you take a pill, you’re going to take another one. You either do it or you don’t,” declared the legend, who has been sober for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>“Demi knows the whole moderation thing is not something I truly agree with,” manager Scooter Braun is heard saying. Braun, who also manages Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, continued to say he knows he “can’t control [them]”.</p>
<p>Demi , who came out as non-binary earlier this year, recently spoke about how <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/27/demi-lovato-non-binary-fan-art/">they struggle to look at old photographs and fan art of themself looking “hyper feminine”.</a></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Scientists have discovered that female California condors, the largest flying birds in North America, can produce chicks without the help of a male.</h3>
<p>The birds, which have a wingspan of around 10 feet, are able to reproduce via a natural phenomenon known as parthenogenesis, a word which comes from the Greek for “<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/14/poland-gdansk-lgbt-free-zone-gay-virgin-mary-vagina-halo-protest-placard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virgin</a> birth”.</p>
<p>It has very rarely been seen in birds, but is seen in some fish, amphibians and reptiles.</p>
<p>Oliver Ryder, the director of conservation genetics for the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/03/california-condor-asexual-reproduction-females-males" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Guardian</em></a> that it was a “eureka moment” when researchers realised two chicks had hatched from unfertilised eggs.</p>
<p>Ryder said: “Many scientists have experiences like this when they see the world in a way they haven’t seen before. I was really pleased to figure out something that was such a conundrum.”</p>
<p>This “conundrum” began in the 1980s, when condors had reached the brink of extinction, and San Diego Zoo needed to record the sex of the 22 remaining wild condors and test their DNA to prevent inbreeding for breeding programmes in captivity.</p>
<p>This turned into a DNA testing programme of the now 900 California condors, but two cases stood out where chicks had no DNA from their presumed fathers.</p>
<p>The findings raised suspicions, and we confirmed with the birth of the two new chicks from unfertilised eggs.</p>

<p>But Ryder believes these findings could stretch further than the condors themselves, and that parthenogenesis could be happening in other species.</p>
<p>“Think about it,” he told <em>The Guardian</em>. “The cases where we do know about it, it’s overwhelmingly where animals are managed in a way where females don’t have access to males.</p>
<p>“It was only because we had these detailed genetic profiles of the condor which were developed in response to the need for managing generic diversity that we discovered this.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A queer man has said no one stepped in to help him when he was beaten and called a “f****t” in a “homophobic” attack on a London tube.</h3>
<p>Alan Hunter, a retail worker from south east London, was on the Jubilee line on his way home from a Steps concert at the O2 Arena on 27 November when the incident occurred, according to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/tube-people-london-canada-water-steps-b1969510.html?fbclid=IwAR3wN8vvtS14qEbr-8Gd1kOmvx4Eyn1y7JZB3mInrO3BchVG_dVc3W9ifg0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Press Association</em></a>.</p>
<p>He said he asked a woman and her friends to stop using stop using balloons of nitrous oxide, also known as nos or laughing gas, on the tube.</p>
<p>An argument started, and the woman and her six friends became violent, said Hunter, 35, originally from Newcastle.</p>
<p>He said: “She pushed us twice in the head, grabbed my hair, I grabbed hers in self-defence, and then the six lads jumped on top of us.”</p>
<p>Hunter admitted that he insulted the woman, but only after she called him a “f**king f****t”.</p>
<p>He said: “Had she not called me a ‘f**king f****t’ I wouldn’t have said anything.</p>
<p>“I refuse for us to be second class citizens and just stand there and take it.”</p>
<p>Hunter, who was left with significant bruising and cuts to his face, said he was disappointed that no one in the tube carriage stepped in to help him during the “homophobic” attack.</p>
<p>“People are protecting themselves and trying to be safe in a dangerous place,” he said.</p>
<p>But at the same time, it’s just completely demoralising, if I saw someone getting hurt I would jump in and help.”</p>

      <category>Celebrity</category>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Instagram comedian Jordan Firstman has spoken out about the misconception that the gay community’s suffering is over.</h3>
<p>In an interview with pop star <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/12/05/charli-xcx-ally-moscow-russia-concert-speech-queer-lgbt-viral/">Charli XCX</a> on the singer’s BBC Sounds podcast <em>Best Song Ever, </em>Firstman is asked which songs he feels soundtrack the experience of being a gay man.</p>
<p>Justifying his choices of “Fabulous” from the <em>High School Musical 2 </em>soundtrack and “One is the Loneliest Number” by Aimee Mann, Firstman explained: “Gay to me is like, delusion. Gay to me is ultimate loneliness.”</p>
<p>“Gay is seen as so, like, ‘Oh, they’ve gotten over their problems. They have PrEP, they can’t get AIDS and they can get married, like they’re good’ [but] there is still so much underneath.</p>
<p>“… because gay men feel like they’re done with the suffering, because the world has become more accepting, at least in the States, [they feel] that they don’t need to do anything.</p>
<p>“There’s not that much trauma, there’s a little bit so it would be really easy to work on it but because right now no one feels like they need to work on it, that trauma ends up pushing gay men into these cycles of sex and drug abuse and partying.”</p>
<p>When asked by the singer if he believes that habits of drug and sex abuse are used as a form of escapism in gay men, Firstman answers: “Totally.”</p>
<p>“Gay men love to f**king party and they always have.”</p>
<p>Jordan Firstman also spoke about an unwillingness to self-reflect among gay men. “To move forward they would have to do this work, and I think they think it’s more work than they need to do but we can get past the trauma. And I’m totally guilty of it too,” the social media star admits, “but I think I have an awareness that makes me at least want to figure out what it’s all about.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the interview, Firstman spoke about the experience of going viral on Instagram at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, when he gained masses of followers for his comedic impressions of characters including banana bread’s publicist and the fly on Mike Pence’s head.</p>
<p>“I blew up really fast and that was a really weird transition. I kept building and building and building. And then suddenly all these famous people loved me,” Jordan recalled.</p>
<p>“It all started to spiral out of control, I had an attempted cancellation that was like… I’m like open about it now.”</p>
<p>“You’re very open about it now!” Charli XCX interjects. “The first time I met you, you were like ‘So, let me tell you – I got cancelled!’ I didn’t know but then I knew.”</p>
<p>Firstman faced heavy backlash in December 2020 when the notorious internet vigilante Instagram account Diet Prada unearthed derogatory tweets posted by the comedian in 2012.</p>

<p>The comedian swiftly issued an apology on his Instagram, writing: “I wrote some offensive jokes on Twitter in 2012 when I was 19 that are now being circulated online. I am deeply regretful and sorry for these tweets; I was young and dumb and trying to find my comedic voice. I have grown a million lifetimes since and I do not stand by them in any way.”</p>
<p>Speaking nearly a year later about his overnight fame followed by extreme criticism over the tweets, Firstman told XCX: “So that put me into a really deep, deep dark depression because I was like ‘I don’t understand why any of these things are happening, these ups and downs are so extreme.'”</p>
<p>Echoing his later statements about escapism, Firstman says he dealt with the stress of the experience by partying for a month and a half in Mexico.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Family of non-binary Georgia Tech student Scout Schultz, who was killed by campus police while in the middle of a mental health crisis, will receive a $1 million settlement.</h3>
<p>Schultz, 21, a fourth-year student who was intersex, non-binary and bisexual and was head of the school’s Pride Alliance, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/09/18/lgbt-student-president-shot-dead-by-campus-police/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was killed in September, 2017. </a></p>
<p>Four campus police officers responded that night when a 911 caller reported that Schultz was “skulking around” carrying a knife and “might have a gun”.</p>
<p>Schultz approached the officers, and appeared to tell them to shoot. One officer told them that “nobody wants to hurt” them”, and another told them to “relax”.</p>
<p>But as Schultz continued to advance, one of the officers, Tyler Beck, 23, fired and killed them with a single shot to the heart.</p>
<p>After their death, a multi-utility tool with a small blade was found on the ground, and there was no gun to be seen.</p>
<p>In 2019, Schultz’s family <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/09/13/scout-schultz-non-binary-wrongful-death-georgia-tech-police-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a wrongful death lawsuit</a> against the officer and Georgia Tech, pointing out that Beck had received no training in crisis intervention, and stating: “Schultz’s death was the result of Georgia Tech’s and the state of Georgia’s failure over time to properly train their personnel to act in such a way as to prevent the exclusion of persons such as Schultz from the safety to which all students were entitled on the campus of Georgia Tech.”</p>
<p>Fulton County district attorney Paul Howard <a href="https://apnews.com/article/911404c041d0a3e9a732dc87affc8035" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later announced</a> that Beck would not face any criminal charges.</p>
<h2>Scout Schultz’s family hope their ‘life will stand for change’</h2>
<p>However, Georgia Tech has made changes since Scout Schultz’s death.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.projectq.us/georgia-tech-to-pay-family-of-slain-lgbtq-student-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Project Q Atlanta</em></a>, the university has assigned $1 million to mental health and wellness initiatives for LGBT+ students, has awarded Schultz’s degree posthumously to their family, and now requires all campus police officers to carry tasers as well as guns and complete 40 hours of crisis intervention training.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>The university has also agreed to pay Schultz’s family $1 million in civil court.</p>
<p>In a statement, their family said: “We are hopeful that the university’s example of caring effort will be replicated nationwide.</p>
<p>“Students have let us know the LGBTQIA community is often overlooked and we hope these positive changes continue and that Scout’s life will stand for change.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A Christian children’s home is suing the Biden administration because it doesn’t want to place children with LGBT+ families.</h3>
<p>The Holston United Methodist Home for Children in Greeneville, Tennessee, is a home which cares for children and helps them find adoptive families and foster care placements.</p>
<p>It is affiliated with the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/05/01/teens-united-methodist-church-confirmation-anti-lgbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">United Methodist Church</a>, which believes that “the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching”, and that “sexual relations are affirmed only within the covenant of monogamous, heterosexual marriage”.</p>
<p>In May, Joe Biden <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/10/joe-biden-healthcare-protections-gay-trans-lgbt-trump-era-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated discrimination protections</a> for LGBT+ people in healthcare and welfare services, after they were <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/09/donald-trump-lgbt-discrimination-protections-health-human-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cruelly stripped by Donald Trump</a>.</p>
<p>The protections mean that any service that receives funding from the government’s Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is banned from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>
<p>Last month, HHS <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/11/18/hhs-takes-action-to-prevent-discrimination-and-strengthen-civil-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that it was doing away with any waivers that allowed discrimination under the guise of religious freedom.</p>
<p>But the Holston United Methodist Home for Children is determined to discriminate against queer families while still receiving federal funding.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/childrens-home-sues-biden-administration-over-placing-kids-same-sex-couples-1655996" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Newsweek</em></a>, the children’s home filed a <a href="https://adfmedialegalfiles.blob.core.windows.net/files/HolstonHomeComplaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit</a> at the US District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee on Thursday (2 December), arguing that the discrimination protections violate its first amendment right to religious freedom.</p>
<p>The home is represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Southern Poverty Law Centre-designated</a> anti-LGBT+ hate group.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

        </section>
        </section>
<p>ADF senior counsel Matt Bowman insisted that the “Biden administration is acting swiftly to exclude faith-based agencies from programmes that provide loving homes to children in need”, which he said “harms kids” and is “an illegal attack on religious freedom”.</p>
<p>But United States Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, who is named in the lawsuit, has said he is “committed” to making sure that religious waivers are not allowed when it comes to discrimination protections.</p>
<p>Announcing the reversal of the waivers, Becerra said in a statement: “HHS reaffirms its important commitment to core American values: HHS will not condone the blanket use of religious exemptions against any person or blank checks to allow discrimination against any persons, importantly including LGBT+ persons in taxpayer-funded programs.</p>
<p>“The waivers are inconsistent with the department’s critical goal of combating discrimination based on religion, sexual orientation, and gender identity.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">A family has been forced to relocate after their local community outed their eight-year-old daughter as trans.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kelsey Waits from Hastings, Minnesota, was running for re-election for chair of the school board when a resident outed her daughter as trans on Facebook and accused her of child abuse. </span></p>
<p>Waits told <em>CNN</em> that her daughter was outed after the election for the school board grew strained, explaining that <span style="font-weight: 400;">the COVID-19 pandemic amped up the pressure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I probably got about the same number of emails from parents saying ‘my child is not going to school if masks are required’ as ‘my child is not going to school if masks aren’t required,'” she told <em>CNN</em>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This community was very split and there were very strong feelings on both sides.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Several residents organised against mask mandates in a Facebook group called Concerned Parents of Hastings. It was in the group that o</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ne parent posted a long complaint about Waits, eventually involving her child. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“She should be locked up for child abuse… Her younger ‘daughter’ is actually a boy,” the parent wrote. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waits’ eight-year-old daughter, Kit, had been living as a girl since she was very young, but the family were not open with others about her being trans in order to protect her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She explained to <em>CNN</em>: “This was my most precious secret. The thing I protected most and the thing I was most afraid of ever being used in a political way because for me, this isn’t political. This is my family, this is my child.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Waits lost her bid for re-election to the school board, however she said the abuse and harassment did not stop, and the family chose to relocate from their home. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s where we’re at right now. There are people that we know that are not safe for our kids in our neighbourhood,” Waits’ husband Chris added. “We can’t trust our kids alone at the bus stop waiting for the bus, not because of the kids necessarily, but because of the parents.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our sadness at the loss of our privacy does not mean that we will sacrifice control of our family’s story.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Our hope now is that, by taking control of our story, we can humanise the kids and families who are hurt when adults use trans children as political pawns, and give hope and support to other families who aren’t able to fight back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The news comes as it was reported that </span><a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/26/lgbt-homeless-trans-compass-community-centre/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBT+ kids in the US are “120 times more likely to be homeless”, due to intolerant families</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the National Centre for Transgender Equality, one in five trans people will experience </span><a href="https://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness"><span style="font-weight: 400;">homelessness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at least once in their lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Julie Seaver, executive director of the Compass Community Center, said: “Our trans people are the most marginalised, the most discriminated against. They have the highest chance of being victimised, whether it be through employment, housing, and unfortunately, murder and death.’</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The co-founder and “head of propaganda” for the anti-LGBT+ neo-Nazi terrorist group National Action has been jailed after promoting “extreme racial violence” to young people.</h3>
<p>In 2013, Ben Raymond, 32, co-founded<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/10/met-metropolitan-police-officer-national-action-terrorist-nazi-group-charged-benjamin-hannam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> National Action</a>, a neo-Nazi group described as “virulently racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic” by the Home Office.</p>
<p>He later became “head of propaganda” for the group, which was banned in 2016 under the Terrorism Act 2000, making it the first far-right group to be proscribed since the Second World War.</p>
<p>After the terrorist group was proscribed, Raymond helped the organisation mutate in a new group called “NS131 – National Socialist Anti-Capitalist Action”, according to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/03/head-propaganda-british-neo-nazi-group-national-action-jailed-ben-raymond" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Press Association</em>. </a></p>
<p>At Bristol crown court, Raymond was found guilty by a jury of being a member of the banned terrorist group, as well as of two counts of possessing a document or record of use to a terrorist.</p>
<p>The documents were “2083 – European Declaration of Independence” by Anders Breivik, a far-right Norwegian terrorist, and released on the same day that he committed the deadliest mass shooting in history, and “Homemade Detonators” by Ragnar Benson. He was acquitted on four similar charges.</p>
<p>Judge Christopher Parker QC handed Raymond an extended 10-year sentence, including two years on licence, and he will be monitored for 15 years under the notification requirements of the Terrorism Act.</p>
<p>He must serve a minimum of five years and four months behind bars before he will be up for parole.</p>
<p>Sentencing Raymond, Parker said that he had used propaganda materials to recruit and “groom” young people.</p>
<p class="dcr-o5gy41">“You intended that the material should be used in order to recruit new members, and specifically new young members,” he said.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p class="dcr-o5gy41">“It is clear this propaganda material was aimed at these young people. In effect, these young people were at risk of being groomed by your material to commit acts of extreme racial violence [with] which National Action no doubt had sympathy.”</p>
<p>In 2015, Raymond was interviewed by the BBC for a programme called <em>Radicals: The Proud Racist. </em></p>
<p>In the interview he said that an “ideal Britain should be a white Britain”, and said he was a “comfortable racist”. He also described National Action as “Nazis and proud”, and said Hitler was a “role model”.</p>
