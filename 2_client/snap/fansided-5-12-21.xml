They&#x2019;re the only team above .500 in the division, and they&#x2019;re only a game behind the Arizona Cardinals for top record in the conference.</p><p>Yet, the purpose of this article is not just to state the obvious to Packers fans, but let them know the soonest possible date they could clinch the division.</p><p>Green Bay has a four-game lead with five left to play. Having lost their only game against the Vikings so far, Minnesota has that matchup in hand for now.</p><p></p><h2 class="speakable-content">NFC North: How soon can Packers clinch?</h2><p>Four weeks from now, the Packers play host to <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/05/vikings-mike-zimmer-lions-firing/">the Vikings</a> at Lambeau Field. It&#x2019;s their second and final matchup against Minnesota this season, and it&#x2019;s both teams&#x2019; second-to-last game of the year. If the Packers haven&#x2019;t clinched by then, somehow, then surely that will be a last stand of sorts.</p><p>But the soonest they can clinch is next week, actually. If the Vikings lose to the Steelers next Thursday, then the Packers will play the Bears to clinch the division. It&#x2019;s that easy.</p><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If the Vikings lose Thursday night vs Steelers, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Packers?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Packers</a> will be playing Bears on Sunday night to clinch the division title. <a href="https://t.co/QwMjIR2can">https://t.co/QwMjIR2can</a></p><p>&#x2014; Mike Spofford (@mikespofford) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikespofford/status/1467606039755472899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><p>Of course, the Packers have greater goals than to just win the division, but it&#x2019;s a good start and ensures a playoff berth with four weeks to play.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>The Mike Zimmer era reached a new low for the Minnesota Vikings with the team losing to the Detroit Lions on Sunday.&#xA0;</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content"><a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/minnesota-vikings/">Minnesota Vikings</a> fans have grown increasingly frustrated with Mike Zimmer and things were just made even worse on Sunday. Heading into the Week 13 matchup with the Detroit Lions, Minnesota was expected to record an impressive win.</p><p>Instead, the team was embarrassed by the Lions and suffered a 29-27 loss. Jared Goff tossed the game-winning touchdown as time expired. What a thriller. Detroit was 0-10-1 before Sunday&#x2019;s matchup, so for Minnesota to lose to a winless team is inexcusable and this is of course on the head coach. Minnesota is now 5-7 on the season. Woof.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Minnesota Vikings fans are calling for Mike Zimmer to be fired</h2><p>As soon as the final whistle went off on Sunday following the showdown with Detroit, Vikings supporters made it more than clear they&#x2019;re sick of Zimmer running the show. This team is looking incredibly average, which shouldn&#x2019;t be the case.</p><p>They&#x2019;ve got star players on both sides of the ball, yet Minnesota is two games under .500. Meanwhile over in Green Bay, the Packers are once again looking like the class of the division and Aaron Rodgers is playing brilliantly.</p><p></p><p>The Minnesota faithful are sick and tired of seeing this on a consistent basis. For the Vikings, they were hoping to get back on track in 2021 after a disappointing 2020. Last season, Minnesota went 7-9 and missed out on the postseason.</p><p>This campaign, it&#x2019;s been more of the same for the Vikings, with inconsistent play continuing to haunt them. It&#x2019;s clear that things just aren&#x2019;t working out with Zimmer in charge. The screams from fans are only going to get louder for him to get fired if this teams keeps on losing like this. They&#x2019;ve simply got to play better and it&#x2019;s up to Zimmer to make sure this team gets it together.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="fs-read-next">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>The Chicago Bears are going nowhere fast and they should do Matt Nagy a favor by putting him out of his misery.</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">The writing is on the wall for Chicago Bears&#x2019; head coach Matt Nagy, who will certainly be fired as soon as the season concludes. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/boxscore/_/gameId/401326511">Chicago fell to the Arizona Cardinals 33-22</a> this afternoon to drop to 4-8 on the season, making a long-shot playoff berth even more unlikely than it was at the start of Week 13.</p><p></p><p>There were reports prior to the Bears&#x2019; Thanksgiving Day game against the Detroit Lions that Nagy was going to be fired after that contest only for the organization to quickly refute them. Chicago has never fired a coach in-season, a tradition they would break by firing Nagy now, but it seems silly to prolong his tenure any further at this point.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Why firing Matt Nagy now makes sense for the Bears</h2><p>Things could get ugly quick for Nagy with the Bears set to renew <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/23/best-nfl-rivalries-all-time/">the NFL&#x2019;s oldest rivalry</a> on Sunday night against the Green Bay Packers, who will be coming off a bye and have extra time to prepare for the matchup. Even getting Justin Fields back for that game wouldn&#x2019;t do much for the Bears, who would essentially have to win out to reach the postseason, a path that is daunting with two games against the Vikings and a trip to Seattle on the schedule in addition to the Packers&#x2019; game.</p><p>The prudent move for Chicago would be to simply let Nagy go now and get a jump start on its search for its next head coach. The Bears can easily interview candidates who aren&#x2019;t attached to NFL teams now, such as rising college coaches like Matt Campbell and Luke Fickell, while the drama swirling around Nagy&#x2019;s future will no longer be a distraction for the team.</p><p>Maintaining a tradition is admirable but there comes a point where tradition can get in the way of progress. Retaining Nagy for another five weeks simply because that is how things have always been done is a self-defeating exercise that does no good for either him or the Bears.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="fs-read-next">

There haven&#x2019;t been rumors connecting the current Clemson coach to Las Vegas, not to mention his buyout and forfeiture of future earnings make it less than optimal, assuming he&#x2019;s not getting Jon Gruden money.</p><p>Speaking of Gruden, who was forced out due to an email controversy that included offensive language, <a href="https://justblogbaby.com/">the Raiders</a> need a new head coach. Interim man&#xA0;Rich Bisaccia isn&#x2019;t expected to be retained after the season.</p><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dabo and The King &#x1F451;<a href="https://twitter.com/ClemsonFB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@clemsonfb</a> x <a href="https://twitter.com/therichardpetty?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@therichardpetty</a> <a href="https://t.co/guEl62maGR">pic.twitter.com/guEl62maGR</a></p><p>&#x2014; Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) <a href="https://twitter.com/Raiders/status/1467583766239404041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><p>Swinney would be an impact hire, but he&#x2019;s reshaped the Clemson program into his image, and it&#x2019;s one of the best jobs in college football. Unless he&#x2019;s itching to go pro, the Raiders are a weird fit.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Why was Dabo Swinney at the Raiders game?</h2><p>Clelin Ferrell, CB Trayvon Mullen, WR Hunter Renfrow, and G John Simpson all went to Clemson. The answer really is that simple. Swinney is just there to catch a professional football game and watch some of his former players. It&#x2019;s actually quite admirable.</p><p></p><p>It makes sense Swinney would rather live in the past, with Clemson having a down year this season. For the first time in what feels like a generation, Clemson didn&#x2019;t even participate in the ACC Championship Game. Instead, Pitt defeated Wake Forest for that honor.</p><p>Swinney has a tremendous relationship with the Raiders, and Vegas QB Derek Carr, despite the fact that Carr didn&#x2019;t even play for him at Clemson.</p><p>&#x201C;Dabo Swinney literally has FaceTimed me or texted me more than like my coaches that I played with in college. I promise,&#x201D; Carr said. &#x201C;This man FaceTimed me the other day, and it wasn&#x2019;t even anything about Hunter. He&#x2019;s like, &#x2018;Hey man, keep it going. Man, so proud of you. I&#x2019;m so fired up.&#x2019; I&#x2019;m like, &#x2018;Dude, you&#x2019;re getting me fired up.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p><p>So, you can see the connection. However, for now, there isn&#x2019;t much to base a rumor around. Raiders fans can go back to their regularly-scheduled programming.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="fs-read-next">

The various rankings that were used to then determine the BCS rankings had some merit to them but also had some serious flaws that led to the four-team playoff. Now, it&#x2019;s the four-team playoff that has some college football fans wanting to go back to the BCS system to determine the teams because of inconsistencies with the playoff committee members.</p><p>Another element of consternation is the playoff is only four teams. It&#x2019;s why playoff expansion is likely coming in the next few years. The only question is whether it&#x2019;ll be an eight-team playoff or a 12-team playoff. But playoff expansion is definitely coming when the conference commissioners can finally agree to what everyone wants.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">BCS rankings mirror what the College Football Playoff committee had</h2><p>The BCS for all its faults was mostly critiqued for the debate of the No. 2 and No. 3 teams. The No. 1 team was often easy to identify, but there were some close calls where the No. 3 team was a worthy challenger for the national championship, but teams like 2004 Auburn and 2011 Oklahoma State, in particular, never got the chance.</p><p>So what if the College Football Playoff ditched the committee members and instead relied on the BCS to determine the four best teams? Would the BCS still have the same four teams as the committee? Would their order be any different? Would a team on the outside of the top four crash the playoff party?</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/BCSKnowHow/status/1467494190993092610">BCSKnowHow.com</a>, that information is at our disposal. Did you know the BCS would have had the same playoff fields that were chosen by the playoff committee for all eight playoffs?</p><h2>BCS would have had exact same 2021 College Football Playoff field</h2><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A final side-by-side comparison of the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CFBPlayoff?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CFBPlayoff</a> ranking and our simulated <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BCS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BCS</a>, headlined by identical top-7s to wrap the 2021: <a href="https://t.co/NZB0RiV4E4">pic.twitter.com/NZB0RiV4E4</a></p><p>&#x2014; BCSKnowHow.com (@BCSKnowHow) <a href="https://twitter.com/BCSKnowHow/status/1467601322895712268?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><p>The BCS would have had the same top four teams, and the same top seven.</p><p>Alabama, Michigan, Georgia, Cincinnati, Notre Dame, Ohio State and Baylor are in the top seven of the BCS and represent the same top seven in the final CFP rankings.</p><p>Oklahoma is the biggest variant from the BCS to the CFP rankings with a five-spot differential from the No. 11 in the BCS and No. 16 in the CFP.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="fs-read-next">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><strong><i>Ohio State football head coach Ryan Day finally responds to his former five-star true freshman&#xA0;quarterback Quinn Ewers entering the transfer&#xA0;portal after only one&#xA0;semester in Columbus.</i></strong></p><p class="speakable-content">Ryan Day was pure class when it came to Quinn Ewers leaving the Ohio State football team by way of the <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/03/quinn-ewers-transfer-portal-texas-texas-am/">transfer portal</a>.</p><p>Ewers was the top quarterback prospect in the Class of 2022. The Texas native reclassified ahead of this college season so he could capitalize on NIL. He was not expected to play much, if at all, during his true freshman season in Columbus. With redshirt freshman C.J. Stroud running away with the job, Ewers made the wise decision to transfer with all of his eligibility still intact.</p><p>The expectation is for the former five-star <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/03/quinn-ewers-transfer-rumors-destinations-texas-texas-am/">to return to the Lone Star State</a>. Ewers is visiting Texas Tech this weekend and is reportedly considering Texas and Texas A&amp;M as well.</p><p>Here is what Day had to say about losing Ewers to the portal after only one semester on campus.</p><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ryan Day on Quinn Ewers: &quot;He was in a very unique situation, for sure. &#x2026; We certainly wish him nothing but the best of luck.&quot;</p><p>&#x2014; Griffin Strom (@GriffinStrom3) <a href="https://twitter.com/GriffinStrom3/status/1467586060863614983?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><h2 class="speakable-content">Ryan Day reflects on Quinn Ewers transferring from the Ohio State program</h2><p>It may have been a frustrating season for the Buckeyes, but it&#x2019;s not the end of the world. They have their answer at quarterback for the foreseeable future in Stroud. While Ohio State has lost two scholarship signal-callers to the portal in Jack Miller III and now Ewers, the Buckeyes still have Kyle McCord on the roster. Though he could transfer too, another year in Columbus could help him.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the Ewers tenure at Ohio State boiled down to two snaps, but he capitalized on his earning power and cashed in with more than $1 million in NIL deals in what would have been his senior year of high school.</p><p>The experience he received at Ohio State and the coaching he received under Day and Ohio State coaches should serve him well in his next stop as the former No. 1 recruit looks to live up to his potential elsewhere.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="fs-read-next">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>It is bowl season in college football and the New Year&#x2019;s Six games have been officially set.</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">After the <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/05/final-cfp-rankings-2021-college-football-playoff-takeaways/">College Football Playoff field</a> was set, the remaining four New Year&#x2019;s Six bowls were filled accordingly with several high-quality teams.</p><p>For the 2022 College Football Playoff, the two national semifinal games will be the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic and the Capital One Orange Bowl. The winner of these two games will meet at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana for the national champion. While getting to the playoff is everything, playing in a New Year&#x2019;s Six bowl is absolutely phenomenal when it comes to recruiting.</p><p>Here is the schedule for the New Year&#x2019;s Six games during this holiday bowl season.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">College Football bowl season: New Year&#x2019;s Six 2022 schedule</h2><h2>Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl: No. 12 Pittsburgh Panthers vs. No. 10 Michigan State Spartans (Thursday, Dec. 30, 7:00 p.m. ET)</h2><p>The ACC Champion Pittsburgh Panthers will face an at-large team out of the Big Ten in the Michigan State Spartans in the Peach Bowl. Pitt would normally go to the Orange Bowl in most years as ACC Champions, but that game is part of the playoff this bowl season. The Peach Bowl in Atlanta will have to do this December.</p><h2>College Football Playoff: Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic: No. 4 Cincinnati Bearcats vs. No. 1 Alabama Crimson Tide (Friday, Dec. 31, 3:30 p.m. ET)</h2><p>As stated before, the <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/05/college-football-playoff-point-spreads-cotton-bowl-alabama-cincinnati/">Cotton Bowl</a> is a playoff game this year. It features the top-seeded SEC Champion Alabama Crimson Tide pitted against the undefeated Group of Five Champion Cincinnati Bearcats. Alabama looks to repeat as national champions, while Cincinnati&#x2019;s historical season keeps on going at the Cotton Bowl over in Arlington, Texas.</p><p></p><h2>College Football Playoff: Capital One Orange Bowl: No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs vs. No. 2 Michigan Wolverines (Friday, Dec. 31, 7:30 p.m. ET)</h2><p>The other playoff game this year is the <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/05/college-football-playoff-point-spreads-orange-bowl-michigan-georgia/">Orange Bowl</a>. It features the Big Ten Champion Michigan Wolverines. While they are the slightly higher seed, the Wolverines will face the No. 3 Georgia Bulldogs as an at-large team out of the SEC. The Dawgs won the SEC East, but are hoping for a rematch with Alabama in Indianapolis. They must beat Michigan in Miami Gardens, Florida first.</p><h2>Playstation Fiesta Bowl: No. 9 Oklahoma State Cowboys vs. No. 5 Notre Dame Fighting Irish (Saturday, Jan. 1, 1:00 p.m. ET)</h2><p>This year&#x2019;s Fiesta Bowl will feature the Big 12 runner-up Oklahoma State Cowboys and the one-loss national independent Notre Dame Fighting Irish. While both teams narrowly missed out on the playoff, this is an exciting bowl matchup taking place over in the Valley of the Sun.</p><h2>Rose Bowl Game Presented by Capital One Venture X: No. 11 Utah Utes vs. No. 6 Ohio State Buckeyes (Saturday, Jan. 1, 5:00 p.m. ET)</h2><p>Due to contractual obligations, the Rose Bowl must feature a Big Ten team vs. a Pac-12 team in years it is not part of the playoff. Meeting in Pasadena on New Year&#x2019;s Day will be the Pac-12 Champion Utah Utes vs. an at-large team out of the Big Ten in the always formidable Ohio State Buckeyes.</p><h2>Allstate Sugar Bowl: No. 8 Ole Miss Rebels vs. No. 7 Baylor Bears (Saturday, Jan. 1, 8:45 p.m. ET)</h2><p>Closing out the New Year&#x2019;s Six is another game with contractual obligations. The Sugar Bowl must feature a Big 12 team vs. an SEC team when it is not part of the playoff. This year&#x2019;s Sugar Bowl in New Orleans will feature the Big 12 Champion Baylor Bears and an at-large team out of the SEC in the Ole Miss Rebels.</p><p>May bowl season be as exciting as the regular season was for anyone who loves this crazy sport.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="fs-read-next">

There may be some players who opt out, but with a chance to make history, don&#x2019;t count on it.</p><p>For Iowa, their offense did them in at the end of the season and the defense that was so good at forcing turnovers and creating points off them, just couldn&#x2019;t continue to put the offense on their backs.

Since signing with Bellator, Justino has finished all three of her opponents. Justino will have to bring her best to get another finish because Kavanagh is as tough as they come. With the opportunity of a lifetime for Kavanagh, you can ensure she will do whatever it takes to win.</p><p>In the co-headliner, Tyrell Fortune and Linton Vassell have the opportunity to climb up the heavyweight rankings. Both fighters come in on a winning streak with the hopes of building off their momentum.</p><p>Bellator 271 also features several other prospects, including Aaron Pico, Justin Gonzales, Steve Mowry, Cody Law, Valerie Loureda, and Mahmoud Fawzy Sebie. Unfortunately, one bout was scratched because Shane O&#x2019;Shea never weighed in. Now that the weigh-in is complete, you can check out the official results below.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Weigh-in results for&#xA0;Bellator 271: Cris Cyborg vs. Sinead Kavanagh</h2><h3>Main Card (7 p.m. ET / 10 p.m. PT, YouTube)</h3><ul><li>Cris Cyborg (145) vs. Sinead Kavanagh (145)</li><li>Tyrell Fortune (253.8) vs. Linton Vassell (239.2)</li><li>Aaron Pico (145.4) vs. Justin Gonzales (145.6)</li><li>Arlene Blencowe (145.8) vs. Pam Sorenson (146)</li><li>Steve Mowry (249.6) vs. Rakim Cleveland (249.6)</li></ul><h3>Preliminary Card (10 p.m. ET / 1 a.m. PT, Showtime)</h3><ul><li>Bruna Ellen (125.6) vs. Desiree Yanez (125.4)</li><li>Roman Faraldo (171) vs. Robert Turnquest (170.8)</li><li>Cody Law (145.4) vs. Colton Hamm (145.8)</li><li>Valerie Loureda (127.6) vs. Taylor Turner (127.2) &#x2013; <em>128 pound catchweight</em></li><li>Jordan Newman (187.6) vs. Shane O&#x2019;Shea (*)</li><li>Waldo Cortes-Acosta (256.6) vs. Mo DeReese (255)</li><li>Mahmoud Fawzy Sebie (170.8) vs. Ethan Hughes (170.8)</li></ul><p>*O&#x2019;Shea never weighed in.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>With enticing free agent Odell Beckham Jr. now signing to NFC West rival the Los Angeles Rams, the Seattle Seahawks need to make moves to combat L.A.</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">When the <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/seattle-seahawks/">Los Angeles Rams</a> stole away Odell Beckham Jr. from the league, the hope of an uplifted offense went with him.</p><p>That&#x2019;s true for several teams who were reportedly courting the eight-year veteran, including the Seattle Seahawks, whose roster gets real thin after D.K. Metcalf and Tyler Lockett.</p><p>Beyond their starting three wideouts, which include Metcalf, Lockett and Freddie Swain, the Seahawks only have one healthy wide receiver on their roster: Penny Hart.</p><p></p><p>Dee Eskridge and John Ursua are on IR, making their wide receiver situation perilous should the team sustain even one more injury.</p><p>With the trade deadline passing on Nov. 2, all the Seahawks can do is add available players in free agency or upgrade players from their practice squad.</p><p>Here are three possible moves the Seahawks can make to bolster their offense and rival the Rams.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">3. Sign Dez Bryant</h2><p>After an impressive comeback season with the Baltimore Ravens in 2020, Dez Bryant remains an <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/top-2021-nfl-free-agents-each-position/">NFL free agent in 2021</a>.</p><p>It remains unclear what Bryant&#x2019;s exact situation is at the moment aside from investing in NFTs, but as of February of this year, Bryant said <a href="https://www.nj.com/giants/2021/02/nfl-rumors-ex-cowboys-wr-dez-bryant-has-no-plans-to-retire-after-comeback-with-ravens.html#:~:text=Giants-,NFL%20rumors%3A%20Ex%2DCowboys%20WR%20Dez%20Bryant%20has%20no%20plans,retire%20after%20comeback%20with%20Ravens&amp;text=The%20Dez%20Bryant%20comeback%20tour,missing%20the%20previous%20two%20seasons.">he has no plans to retire</a>. If available, the Seahawks could work out the 33-year-old veteran who made his name as a longtime Dallas Cowboy.</p><p>At the very least, the Seahawks could work out Bryant to see what they&#x2019;re working with and determine whether or not he&#x2019;s a fit for their offense.</p><h2>2. Sign Golden Tate</h2><p>It&#x2019;s easy to make a case for Golden Tate, who began his career with the Seattle Seahawks and won a ring with the team in 2013.</p><p>Tate, who is also 33, remains an available free agent like Bryant. As of June 2021, Tate discussed <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/golden-tate-free-agent-wr-wish-list-titans-colts-rams#:~:text=%EF%BB%BFGolden%20Tate%EF%BB%BF%20remains,388%20yards%20and%20two%20TDs.">which teams he&#x2019;d like to sign with</a>.</p><p>But Tate was also on an NFL team last season, so barring any injury or decline in athleticism, his skill set could be greatly utilized on the Seahawks a decade after he first joined the team.</p><p>Tate can be signed for depth, or to compliment Lockett and Metcalf on the field.</p><h2>1. Upgrade Cody Thompson</h2><p>If the Seahawks want to keep things in-house, they could always upgrade a player from the practice squad. They did it earlier this year when they signed Penny Hart from the practice squad to the 53-man roster, and Hart is the only backup wide receiver on the roster who isn&#x2019;t on IR.</p><p>While Thompson has never made an active NFL roster, he has been on a practice squad since he joined the league in 2019. Thompson began with the Chiefs, then the Bengals, before finishing his rookie season with the Seahawks.</p><p>Thompson put together &#x201C;<a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/gm-report/seahawks-90-man-roster-primer-cody-thompson">an impressive training camp last July</a>&#x201C;, but high competition for few wide receiver spots has&#xA0; kept Thompson off the roster.</p><p>But if Ursua and Eskridge are unable to join this season, it may be time for Seattle to turn back to their practice squad and upgrade Thompson.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="light" data-text="D.K.
