                    <media:description><![CDATA[<h2>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in Whole Foods</h2>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle went to great lengths to keep their romance under wraps when they first began dating in 2016. The Duke told <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/prince-harry" rel="nofollow"    >Dax Shepard's <em>Armchair Expert</em> podcast</a></strong> in May 2021 that he and his future wife came up with a <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/20210513113065/prince-harry-meghan-markle-secret-date-london-supermarket/">secret way to meet one another</a></strong> in public. </p>

<p>Harry said: <strong>"The first time Meghan and I met up for her to come and stay with me, we met up in a supermarket in London, pretending we didn't know each other, so were texting each other from the other side of the aisles."</strong></p>

<p>He continued: "There's people looking at me, giving me all these weird looks, and coming up to me and saying 'hi'.</p>

<p>"I texted her saying 'Is this the right one?' and she said, 'No you want parchment paper,' and I'm like, 'Where's the parchment paper?!'</p>

<p>"It was nice, I had a baseball cap on, looking down at the floor, trying to stay incognito."</p>

<p>While Harry didn't name the supermarket in question, Meghan was previously spotted walking solo through the gates of Kensington Palace <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2016111134545/meghan-markle-jets-to-see-harry/">after a shopping trip</a></strong> to pick up some groceries from Whole Foods supermarket.</p>

<p>During their week-long tour of Scotland in May 2021, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/20210526114029/kate-middleton-prince-william-secret-date-night-st-andrews/">spotted leaving Forgan's restaurant</a></strong> in St Andrews after enjoying a romantic meal. </p>

<p>"There was a crowd outside once they left but as far as inside goes it was quiet," said manager Marc, who declined to give his last name.</p>

<p>"There was no pomp and ceremony or fanfare, they were very nice and when they left they were very complimentary."</p>

<p>And the next day during a busy day of engagements, William and Kate also popped into the award-winning Anstruther Fish Bar for a <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/20210527114095/kate-middleton-prince-william-scotland-fish-and-chips-date/">low-key takeaway</a></strong>. </p>

<p>According to the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-9624461/Prince-William-Kate-Middleton-pop-chippy.html" rel="nofollow"    ><em>Daily Mail</em></a></strong>, the pair were 'regular customers' while they were students some 20 years ago, and ordered a £7.95 haddock supper, wrapped in paper, which they ate on a bench near the pier.</p>

<p>Kate was spotted browsing the Halloween costumes with Prince George and Princess Charlotte in the Hardwick branch of Sainsbury's in King's Lynn (close to the Cambridges' country home Anmer Hall) during autumn half term in 2019.</p>

<p>Fellow shopper Kathy Whittaker said: "Another shopper said that Kate was in the shop near the clothing and pointed where she was to me. I just couldn't believe it!</p>

<p>"She was with Charlotte and George looking at Halloween outfits but her bodyguard was kind of watching people with phones and telling them no pictures. I managed to get the photo as she was at the self service check out.</p>

<p>"I didn't see what she actually bought. The lady that told me she was there had children with her and she said Kate was asking her children what they were going to be for Halloween. I think she bought some Halloween bits for her kinds but I don't know what."</p>

<p>Also this summer, Prince Harry and Meghan were spotted at a pub close to their home. The new parents <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019082876985/prince-harry-meghan-markle-archie-local-pub/">enjoyed a meal at The Rose & Crown</a></strong> in Winkfield village, which is a ten-minute drive away from Frogmore Cottage.</p>

<p><em>The Sun</em> reported that the royals tucked into a £15 Sunday roast, and while Harry had a couple of pints of beers during the two-hour visit, Meghan appeared to stick to water. Their son Archie slept in a car seat on a chair next to their table. Despite the heatwave, the royals sat inside and went largely unnoticed by fellow customers. They were joined by a royal aide and were watched over by two protection officers.</p>

<p>If it's good enough for Kate, it's good enough for us! The Duchess was one of many frantic shoppers at The Range in Norfolk, doing her last-minute Christmas shopping. Kate, who was joined by Prince George and Princess Charlotte, was pictured picking out gifts at the outlet store, which is a 15-minute drive away from Sandringham.</p>

<p>A fellow mum told <em>The Sun</em>: "I recognised little Prince George holding Kate's hand and Charlotte with a red bow in her hair. When Kate got to the checkouts I plucked up courage to ask if she'd do a selfie with me and my kids. She very politely declined. She was so nice, explaining she was just doing a bit of Christmas shopping."</p>

The lovebirds made a low-key outing to Pines and Needles in Battersea, where they picked up a medium-sized tree.</p>

<p>"They came in at about 8.30pm last night," a spokesperson for the shop told <strong>HELLO!</strong>. "Prince Harry was with Meghan and hilariously the staff only recognised Meghan at first – they were so excited to have the girl from Suits there. It wasn&#39;t particularly cold but they were gloved and hatted out. "They arrived in a car and picked up a tree – they were there for about 15 minutes browsing and then having a look, then they selected their tree and Harry carried it on his shoulder once it was netted up, back to the car."</p>

<p>Just like any other parent, Kate was in back to school mode in September 2018, when she was spotted picking up Prince George&#39;s school uniform in Peter Jones on Sloane Square. Not only did Kate show what a hands-on mother she is, but the royal also proved she makes the same rookie parenting mistakes.</p>

<p>A source told <strong>HELLO!</strong> that <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2018090461910/kate-middleton-buying-george-charlotte-socks-mistake/">Kate turned up to purchase</a></strong> her children&#39;s school shoes without one crucial item – their socks! George and Charlotte, who were wearing summer sandals, had to borrow a pair from the shop in order to try on their smart new shoes.</p>

<p>Like most of us, royal brothers <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/cuisine/2018041747880/prince-william-fan-of-nandos/">William and Harry are big fans of Nando&#39;s</a></strong>. The future King was introduced to the chicken shop by his personal protection officer and admitted the restaurant chain is "very good".</p>

<p>Back in 2013, his brother Harry was spotted doing a midnight order in the Fulham branch. Harry, who was 24 years old at the time, tried to fly under the radar wearing jeans and a polo shirt, and partially hiding under a baseball cap. He and his friend ordered chicken breast fillet in pitta bread with a lemon and herb marinade and a side of creamy mash, and a double chicken breast wrap with a medium spice marinade and a side of regular chips. Nice one, Harry!</p>

<p>The second-in-line to the throne surprised fellow travellers when he was spotted <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2015070226079/prince-william-budget-airline-ryanair/">boarding a Ryanair flight</a></strong> to Glasgow in 2015. William, who was dressed casually, was travelling to Scotland as part of his training to fly with the East Anglian Air Ambulance.</p>

<p>An eyewitness told <em>The Sun</em>: "The plane was delayed for about 20 minutes and nobody knew why. Then when it landed we realised the Prince was on board. I never expected to see him on Ryanair, but it&#39;s refreshing to see a member of the royal family take a cheap flight."</p>

<p>In fact, the royals do tend to travel on budget airlines. William and Kate have flown Flybe before and in the summer of 2019, the couple, along with their three children and nanny, were spotted disembarking a Flybe airplane in Aberdeen. The Cambridges were visiting the Queen in Scotland.</p>

<p>Kate is a loyal customer of Waitrose and has often been spotted picking up her groceries in the Norfolk branch, bag of life in hand, when she&#39;s staying at the royals&#39; country home. She and William also do an online order during the school holidays and on more than one occasion, Prince George likes to offer a helping hand. According to <em>The Sun</em>, George asks which bag he can carry when the delivery van comes to the door. How sweet!</p>

<p>"My workout regime is primarily dancing eight to ten hours a day. Hot yoga keeps my muscles elongated and my mind focused. I love finding new ways to stay fit so I don’t get bored. I go for fast-paced walks, try different classes at the gym and do military fitness in the park. I think I might try indoor climbing next – you can never be too adventurous."</p>

<p>Posing alongside her fellow <em>Strictly</em> pros, we can tell she is no stranger to the gym!</p>

<p><strong>HELLO!</strong> takes a look at some of the most incredible photos of the royal family's last Christmas at Windsor Castle in 1987…</p>

                    <media:description><![CDATA[<p>The royals are some of the most well-known figures around the globe, but they haven't been exempt from the odd scandal or two over the years.</p>

<p>From <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/prince-andrew/">Prince Andrew</a></strong>'s retirement from public life to Princess Diana's tell-all Panorama interview, <strong>HELLO!</strong> takes a look at some of the most shocking royal events to date. </p>

<h2>Prince Michael of Kent</h2>

<p>In May 2021, it was reported that <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/prince-michael-of-kent/">Prince Michael of Kent</a></strong> was willing to use his royal status for personal profit and to seek favours from Russian president Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Channel 4 Dispatches and The Sunday Times collaborated to set up the fake South Korean gold company called House of Haedong. It was claimed that Prince Michael responded by showing interest in working with the company, telling undercover reporters that he would give House of Haedong his royal endorsement in a recorded speech for a $200,000 (£143,00) fee and was happy to use his home in Kensington Palace as a backdrop.</p>

<p>Responding to the programme, Prince Michael's office said: "Prince Michael receives no public funding and earns his own living through a consultancy company that he has run for over 40 years. Prince Michael has no special relationship with President Putin. They last met in June 2003 and Prince Michael has had no contact with him or his office since then."</p>

<p>After talks with the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge in Sandringham, an agreement was reached that the Sussexes would no longer receive public funds and <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2020011883307/prince-harry-meghan-markle-future-roles-update/">will not use their HRH titles</a></strong>, but that they would keep their patronages and retain Frogmore Cottage as their UK home.</p>

                    <media:description><![CDATA[<h2>The Duke of York</h2>

<p>The Queen's second son <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019112080873/prince-andrew-steps-down-royal-duties-after-jeffrey-epstein-scandal/">stepped back from royal duties</a></strong> in November 2019, following his <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111780693/prince-andrew-jeffrey-epstein-scandal-sarah-ferguson-supports-royal/">TV interview</a></strong> with <em>BBC Newsnight</em>, which focused on his connections to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

<p>Prince Andrew's statement at the time read: "I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission. I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. </p>

<p>"His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."</p>

<p>In August 2021, Virginia Giuffre began legal action against Prince Andrew for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager.</p>

<p>Lawyers for Ms Giuffre filed the civil suit seeking unspecified damages at a federal court in New York, where the court documents claim she was "lent out for sexual purposes" by Jeffrey Epstein including while she was still a minor under US law.</p>

<p>Prince Andrew has vehemently denied the allegations in the past, and a spokesman for the Duke said there was "no comment" when asked to respond to Ms Giuffre's legal action.</p>

                    <media:description><![CDATA[<h2>Prince Harry and Meghan</h2>

<p>The Sussexes' tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021 <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/20210308108386/meghan-markle-oprah-interview-surprising-revelations/">dropped many bombshells that shocked the world</a></strong>. While the couple shared some heartwarming anecdotes about life in the US with their son Archie, and also revealed that they were expecting a girl in the summer (royals generally tend not to reveal their baby's gender until after the birth), Harry and Meghan did make some surprising revelations.</p>

<p><strong>MORE: <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/gallery/20210801118643/royals-taken-by-surprise-in-public/1/">16 times the royals were taken by surprise</a></strong></p>

<p>Among them was that the Duchess had felt suicidal during her first pregnancy, that certain members of the royal family had "shown concern" about Archie's skin colour, that Prince Charles had cut Harry off and that the Firm had refused to pay for Archie's security costs. Meghan also clarified reports from the time of her wedding, claiming that it was actually her sister-in-law Kate who had made her cry about the bridesmaids' dresses in the lead-up to the nuptials, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>Following the explosive interview, <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/20210309108441/the-queen-statement-prince-harry-meghan-markle-interview/">the Queen released a statement</a></strong> saying: "The whole family is saddened to learn the full extent of how challenging the last few years have been for Harry and Meghan. The issues raised, particularly that of race, are concerning. While some recollections may vary, they are taken very seriously and will be addressed by the family privately. Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved family members."</p>

<p>The Duke and <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/kate-middleton/">Duchess of Cambridge</a></strong> were awarded £92,000 in damages in 2017 after French <em>Closer</em> magazine published topless photos of Kate on a private holiday in Provence in 2012. A French court ruled that the paparazzi pictures were an invasion of the couple's privacy.</p>

<p>A statement from Kensington Palace at the time read: "This incident was a serious breach of privacy, and their Royal Highnesses felt it essential to pursue all legal remedies.</p>

<p>"They wished to make the point strongly that this kind of unjustified intrusion should not happen."</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/princess-diana/">Princess Diana</a></strong> shocked the world when she sat down for an extensive interview with <em>BBC1 Panorama</em> in November 1995, in which she spoke candidly to interviewer Martin Bashir about the breakdown of her marriage to <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a></strong>, her battle with bulimia and life behind palace walls.</p>

<p>In May 2021, Lord Dyson's inquiry into the BBC programme found that Bashir engaged in "deceitful behaviour" to secure the world exclusive, faking bank statements that suggested individuals were being paid to keep the princess under surveillance.</p>

<p>The Queen's younger sister shocked the nation when her separation from photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones was announced by Kensington Palace in 1976.</p>

<p>While the palace announced at the time that the couple did not plan to divorce, two years later <strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/princess-margaret/">Princess Margaret</a></strong> began legal proceedings to officially end the marriage.</p>

<p>Although attitudes to divorce at the time were changing, a royal divorce was still considered unthinkable and it was the first divorce of a senior member of the British royal family since Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha's in 1901. </p>

<p>The monarch triggered a constitutional crisis in 1936 when he proposed to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson. The Church of England and government ministers opposed divorce at the time and so King Edward VIII chose to abdicate to wed the woman he loved.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his younger brother George VI – the father of the future Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Edward and Wallis married in France and spent the remainder of their lives in the country.</p>
