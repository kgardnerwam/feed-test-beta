<p>On the morning of Aug. 14, 1936, two NBC employees met for breakfast at a caf&#xE9; in Berlin. Max Jordan and Bill Slater were discussing the Olympic Games they were broadcasting back to the United States &#x2013; and the Nazi propaganda machine that had made their work, and their visit to Germany, somewhat unpleasant.</p>



<p>Slater complained about all the staged regimentation and the obviously forced smiles everywhere.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Why don&#x2019;t they revolt? We wouldn&#x2019;t stand for all this browbeating and bullying in America. I know that. Why do they stand for it here?&#x201D; Slater asked Jordan.</p>



<p>As they were talking, three armed Nazi guards sat down at the next table. The whole caf&#xE9; quieted. &#x201C;It was as though a chill had come over those present,&#x201D; Jordan later recalled. &#x201C;In a nutshell, there was the answer to Bill&#x2019;s question.&#x201D;</p>



<p>I included the story Max Jordan recounted in his memoir&#xA0;<a href="https://www.press.uillinois.edu/books/?id=p082214">in my book on the Nazi origins of Olympic broadcasting</a>&#xA0;because it perfectly encapsulated the quandary facing American sports journalists whenever the International Olympic Committee pushes them to broadcast happy images provided by repressive regimes.</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s now less than 100 days from the opening ceremony of the&#xA0;<a href="https://olympics.com/en/beijing-2022/">2022 Beijing Winter Olympics</a>, and therefore it&#x2019;s time for an honest discussion about the ethics of sport journalism and the morality of American media&#x2019;s complicity with authoritarian regimes that hide the active repression of their citizens.</p>

<h2 id="h-abundant-evidence">Abundant evidence</h2>



<p>The world knows what China is doing right now. Courageous reporting has publicized the series of&#xA0;<a href="https://www.icij.org/investigations/china-cables/as-global-pressure-over-human-rights-abuses-in-xinjiang-picks-up-china-remains-defiant/">repressive domestic</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/operation-fox-hunt-how-china-exports-repression-using-a-network-of-spies-hidden-in-plain-sight">international actions taken by the Chinese government</a>&#xA0;over the past five years.</p>



<p>The&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-detention-camp.html">persecution of the Uyghurs</a>&#xA0;and other human rights abuses, the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/24/chinas-new-hong-kong-laws-a-breach-of-agreement-foreign-officials-say.html">abrogation of the Hong Kong treaty</a>&#xA0;along with the imposition of the&#xA0;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/hong-kong-europe-business-5a7f50d5d5027fda34f9addeb883e809">Chinese government&#x2019;s repression</a>&#xA0;in that port city, and the prevention of&#xA0;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/07/22/1019244601/china-who-coronavirus-lab-leak-theory">a comprehensive and transparent investigation</a>&#xA0;into the origins of COVID-19 are all well documented.</p>



<p>Thus, the Chinese government now wants good press in the West. And its efforts to ensure favorable coverage have prompted new concerns about media control and censorship during the Games, with&#xA0;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/us-calls-china-not-limit-journalists-freedom-2022-beijing-winter-olympics-2021-11-04/">a U.S. government spokesman recently</a>&#xA0;urging Chinese government officials &#x201C;not to limit freedom of movement and access for journalists and to ensure that they remain safe and able to report freely, including at the Olympic and the Paralympic Games.&#x201D;</p>



<p>But, as was clear from the experience during the 1936 Olympics, if U.S. journalists go to Beijing and emphasize the beauty of its landscape, the happiness of its citizenry and its futuristic infrastructure, and fail to cover the more controversial realities in China, that would signal compliance with &#x2013; and promotion of &#x2013; Chinese propaganda.</p>



<p>This is American sports journalism&#x2019;s Red Smith moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-politics-meet-sports">Politics, meet sports</h2>



<p>On Jan. 4, 1980, Walter &#x201C;Red&#x201D; Smith, the veteran New York Times sports columnist,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/01/04/archives/boycott-the-moscow-olympics-sports-of-the-times-we-should-have.html">surprised his readership</a>&#xA0;with his endorsement of the boycott movement against that summer&#x2019;s Moscow Olympic Games. Boycott advocates were protesting the Soviet Union&#x2019;s invasion of Afghanistan.</p>



<p>Smith&#x2019;s stance was unexpected, as he had carefully sidestepped &#x2013; or even ignored &#x2013; many other moments he considered unhealthy political intrusion into international athletic competition. But Smith wrote that history had proved that America&#x2019;s participation in the Nazi Games was a mistake &#x2013; even if the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/naming-heatwaves-custodians-vs-covid-19-nba-barbers-online-moderators-jesse-owens-granddaughter-and-more-1.5719784/remembering-jesse-owens-the-black-olympian-who-humiliated-hitler-1.5719794">great Black American runner Jesse Owens</a>&#xA0;redeemed the event in public memory.</p>



<p>&#x201C;When Americans look back to the 1936 Olympics,&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/01/04/archives/boycott-the-moscow-olympics-sports-of-the-times-we-should-have.html">Smith wrote in his famous column</a>, &#x201C;they take pleasure only in the memory of Jesse Owens&#x2019; four gold medals.&#x201D; Outside of that, he admitted, &#x201C;we are ashamed at having been guests at Adolf Hitler&#x2019;s big party.&#x201D;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/01/16/obituaries/red-smith-sports-columnist-who-won-pulitzer-dies-at-76.html">Smith was an old-school sports reporter</a>, already an old-timer in 1980 &#x2013; he died in 1982. His reporting and columns reflected the influence of&#xA0;<a href="https://theathletic.com/1876184/2020/06/18/how-he-played-the-game-assessing-the-complicated-legacy-of-grantland-rice/">Grantland Rice</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/17/archives/paul-gallico-sportswriter-and-author-is-dead-at-78-founded-golden.html">Paul Gallico</a>, the giants who invented modern American sports writing in the 1920s. But there had always existed another group of sports reporters less afraid to point out obvious political unpleasantness.</p>



<p>For example, the great&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/12/06/archives/jimmy-cannon-columnist-dies-sportswriter-ranged-far-afield-protege.html">Jimmy Cannon</a>&#xA0;had no problem freely peppering political references and acerbic commentary throughout his columns. Westbrook Pegler detested the Nazis and&#xA0;<a href="https://olympic-century.blogspot.com/2016/11/arms-and-olympics-westbrook-pegler-and.html">criticized them relentlessly</a>&#xA0;throughout the 1936 Games. And Howard Cosell&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEg3uNqsTYQ">sharp commentaries</a>, on such issues as Muhammad Ali&#x2019;s boxing suspension in the 1960s and the political activism that erupted in 1968 in Mexico City, remain a credit to his legacy.</p>



<p>That Red Smith had spent decades remaining largely apolitical in public made his support for the boycott surprising. That he was only the second sports columnist to be&#xA0;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/walter-wellesley-red-smith">awarded a Pulitzer Prize</a>, and that his opinions were widely respected, gave his endorsement significant clout.</p>



<h2>&#x2018;The one lever we have&#x2019;</h2>



<p>Smith opened the gates for others to point out the incongruity and obvious hypocrisy of celebrating the Soviet Union&#x2019;s peaceful intentions while the Soviet army was invading and occupying Afghanistan. In his column, Smith quoted British Member of Parliament Neville Trotter, who led the boycott movement in Great Britain.</p>



<p>&#x201C;This is the one lever we have to show our outrage at this naked aggression by Russia,&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1980/01/04/archives/boycott-the-moscow-olympics-sports-of-the-times-we-should-have.html">Trotter told Smith</a>. &#x201C;We should do all we can to reduce the Moscow Olympics to a shambles.&#x201D;</p>



<p>One well-known and nationally respected sports journalist has explicitly and unambiguously called for boycotting the 2022 Beijing Games: Sally Jenkins. The Washington Post&#x2019;s veteran columnist &#x2013; who last year was a finalist for&#xA0;<a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/finalists/sally-jenkins-washington-post">the Pulitzer Prize for commentary</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; published a scorching column plainly stating that &#x201C;ignorance is no longer an excuse.&#x201D;</p>



<p>&#x201C;It was a forgivable mistake to award an Olympics to Beijing in 2008,&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/08/09/boycott-beijing-olympics">she wrote</a>. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unforgivable to hold one there now.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Red Smith&#x2019;s boycott column remains one of his most important and lasting examples of public service. As a media historian, I believe that those who emulate his courage today, like Sally Jenkins, will likely be remembered in the same way tomorrow.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><em>Adapted from&#xA0;</em>Flywheels: How Cities Are Creating Their Own Futures<em>&#xA0;by Tom&#xA0;Alberg&#xA0;published by Columbia Business School Publishing. Copyright (c) 2021 Tom&#xA0;Alberg. Used by arrangement with the Publisher. All rights reserved.</em></p>



<p>Among dozens of cities that aspired to be one of the top tech hubs, how did Seattle become one of the two leading centers of technological invention in the world? Why did Jeff Bezos decide to base his internet bookstore here, rather than in Silicon Valley or staying in New York City? Why did home-grown entrepreneurs like Craig McCaw and Bill Gates set their roots down here? Even before them, the companies that gave us the first commercially successful ultrasound imagers, heart defibrillators, and barcode readers sprang up in Seattle.</p>



<p>Why not Minneapolis, Memphis, or Minsk? Why does Seattle continue to be a place that nurtures the development of breakthrough technologies? I&#x2019;ve spent a long time thinking about this, working with tech companies of all sizes and quizzing colleagues.</p>



<p>All roads lead back to our economic flywheel.</p>



<p>Strictly speaking, a flywheel is a mechanical device, a wheel to which force is applied, creating a rotation that releases energy. Without additional force to turn it, friction will gradually slow the wheel to a halt. But if sufficient new force is applied, the wheel spins faster and faster, creating still more energy that keeps it spinning. Flywheels have been around for at least ten thousand years &#x2014; potter&#x2019;s wheels are flywheels. James Watt used a flywheel in his eighteenth-century steam engine that powered the Industrial Revolution.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-amazon wp-block-embed-amazon"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Flywheels: How Cities Are Creating Their Own Futures" type="text/html" width="640" height="550" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="max-width:100%" src="https://read.amazon.com/kp/card?preview=inline&amp;linkCode=kpd&amp;ref_=k4w_oembed_pcx1rEqarvj40R&amp;asin=0231199546&amp;tag=kpembed-20"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>Writers, too, have found inspiration in the flywheel. Poetry magazine uses its mechanism as a metaphor for the way &#x201C;energy, movement and potential&#x201D; generate new ideas. And in her book <em>The Writing Life</em>, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Annie Dillard advises writers everywhere: &#x201C;Get to work. Your work is to keep cranking the flywheel that turns the gears that spin the belt in the engine of belief that keeps you and your desk in midair.&#x201D;</p>



<p>I was first introduced to the notion of a flywheel as an engine for growing a business at a meeting of Amazon&#x2019;s board of directors in the fall of 2001. We were in the midst of the dot-com bust, and the company was losing lots of money. Jeff Bezos had assembled his S-team of ten senior executives and board of directors to hear from the management consultant Jim Collins, author of the bestselling book <em>Good to Great</em> (2001). Collins talked about the concept of a business-centric flywheel, which he explained as the effect of numerous small initiatives acting upon each other. Like compound interest, he said, the growth would be slow at first but gain momentum over time.</p>



<p>The economy was highly stressed. The NASDAQ had peaked in March 2000, and now, with the dot-com bubble burst, a recession had set in. Financial markets that had been wildly positive about internet companies during the late 1990s, showering the sector with venture and public capital, had grown jittery &#x2014; especially bondholders, and Amazon had raised several billion dollars through bond issues. The company&#x2019;s stock fell from over $100 a share to $6. In May 1999, Barron&#x2019;s headlined a front-page story &#x201C;Amazon.Bomb,&#x201D; and two years later <em>Washington Post</em> columnist David Streitfeld quoted a financial analyst who said he &#x201C;expects the Internet retailer to run out of money&#x2026;later this year.&#x201D;</p>



<p>But Bezos was focused on the long term. He&#x2019;d invited Collins to talk to the board and senior managers about sustainable growth, so Collins drew for us an Amazon-specific flywheel. It showed a virtuous cycle, where low prices brought in customers, and more customers allowed Amazon to add more products for sale, the volume reducing prices further and attracting still more customers in a gradually accelerating flywheel. Bezos liked this concept, and the flywheel &#x2014; with a few Bezos modifications &#x2014; became a key part of his guiding philosophy at Amazon. He often uses it in employee meetings and public presentations.</p>



<p>The Amazon flywheel is centered on growth. To generate momentum, it begins by providing buyers a marketplace with great product selection, convenience, and low prices. As consumers are attracted, traffic increases customer experience, which attracts still more customers. As Amazon grows, the flywheel spins faster and faster.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1950" height="1370" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg" alt class="wp-image-156656" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg 1950w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg?resize=1536,1079 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg?resize=375,263 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg?resize=640,450 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg?resize=768,540 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg?resize=1024,719 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.1.jpg?resize=1280,899 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1950px) 100vw, 1950px"><figcaption>(Credit: Amazon)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Amazon also uses innovative business processes &#x2014; such as opening the site to third-party sellers. They appreciate the ease of selling and shipping products through Amazon. The company benefits from a vastly increased inventory, and competition among the sellers lowers prices. The flywheel concept quickly became integrated as a guiding principle at Amazon, which then conceived new flywheels for its Prime and video divisions.</p>



<p>As I began to write this book, in an effort to explain the increasing momentum in Seattle, I thought back to that afternoon with Jeff and the Amazon team. Board members in the room, in addition to Jeff and myself, were venture capitalist John Doerr, then Gates Foundation CEO Patti Stonesifer, and Intuit founder Scott Cook.</p>



<p>At my firm, Madrona Venture, we talk about the three pillars of Seattle&#x2019;s innovation economy: invention, entrepreneurs, and funding. As I pondered, it became obvious that the most accurate and dynamic way to think about Seattle&#x2019;s economy is with the concept of a flywheel. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1950" height="1626" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg" alt class="wp-image-156657" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg 1950w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg?resize=1536,1281 1536w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg?resize=375,313 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg?resize=640,534 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg?resize=768,640 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg?resize=1024,854 1024w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Flywheels-2.2.jpg?resize=1280,1067 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1950px) 100vw, 1950px"><figcaption>(Credit: Tom Alberg)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Seattle&#x2019;s version, it begins with talented people &#x2014; entrepreneurs, inventors, and leaders &#x2014; who create innovations which begets startups. Startups spawn successful companies that then attract talented people who create innovations. Successful companies also generate wealth and jobs, which provides the energy to support the new startups that those creative people inevitably launch. And so the cycle continues. As more talented people move to Seattle, more innovations give rise to new companies, which attract more creative people, and the flywheel accelerates.</p>



<p>This is a useful way to look at the growth of Seattle&#x2019;s high-tech economy and a model for other cities to emulate when growing their own economies. But how did this flywheel get going before we had lots of creative people, inventions, capital, startups, and successful companies? How did Seattle become a world leader in aviation, software, wireless communication, biotechnology, the cloud, and online retail? How did we become a leading place for innovation of all kinds?</p>

<p>The way I see it, Seattle has had two economic flywheels &#x2014; one that generated its early growth and one that generates momentum today. What the two have in common is a beautiful setting with plenty of opportunities that attract pioneering, entrepreneurial types, and keep them here.</p>



<p>Seattle&#x2019;s earliest ingredients for a flywheel are its location and natural resources. You could call that the power of place. In the mid-nineteenth century, it was a remote place, with few residents but plentiful timber and fish. The geographic location of this muddy new town &#x2014; on the shores of the Pacific, ringed with snow-capped mountains &#x2014; was itself a magnet for people with dreams. We now refer to it as the Mount Rainier effect, a shorthand for the heart-stopping vistas we use as a recruiting tool even today. But the real draw for Seattle, originally, and still, is opportunity.</p>

<p>While cybercriminals continue to leverage the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, they will also find new opportunities to attack such as deepfakes, cryptocurrency and mobile wallets.</p>



<p>In 2021, cyber criminals adapted their attack strategy to exploit vaccination mandates, elections and the shift to hybrid work, to target organizations&#x2019; supply chains and networks for them to achieve maximum disruption.</p>



<p>The sophistication and scale of cyberattacks will continue to break records and we can expect a huge increase in the number of ransomware and mobile attacks. Looking ahead, organizations should remain aware of the risks and ensure that they have the appropriate solutions in place to prevent them without disrupting their normal business flow. To stay ahead of threats, organizations must be proactive and leave no part of their attack surface unprotected or unmonitored or otherwise risk becoming the next victim of sophisticated, targeted attacks.</p>



<h2 id="global-cybercrime-predictions-for-2022">Global cybercrime predictions for 2022:</h2>



<ul><li>Fake news 2.0 and the return of misinformation campaigns</li></ul>



<p>The claim of &#x2018;fake news&#x2019; surrounding contentious issues has become a new attack vector over previous years without people really understanding its full impact. Throughout 2021, misinformation was spread about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination information. The black market for fake vaccine certificates expanded globally, now selling fakes from&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/09/14/amid-vaccine-mandates-fake-vaccine-certificates-become-a-full-blown-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">29 countries</a>. Fake &#x2018;vaccine passport&#x2019; certificates were on sale for&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/08/10/black-market-for-fake-vaccine-certificates-reaches-new-peaks-while-delta-variant-keeps-spreading-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$100-120</a>&#xA0;and the volume of advertisement groups and group sizes publishing sellers multiplied within the year. In 2022, cyber groups will continue to leverage these types of fake news campaigns to execute cybercrime through various phishing attacks and scams.</p>



<p>In addition, prior to the 2020 US presidential election, Check Point researchers spotted surges in malicious&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2020/10/14/as-the-2020-us-presidential-election-approaches-cybersecurity-risks-abound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">election-related domains</a>&#xA0;and the use of &#x201C;meme camouflage&#x201D; aimed at shifting public opinion. In the run-up to the US midterm elections in November 2022, we can expect to see these activities in full effect and for misinformation campaigns to return on social media.</p>



<ul><li>Cyberattacks targeting supply chains</li></ul>



<p>Supply chain attackers take advantage of a lack of monitoring within an organization&#x2019;s environment. They can be used to perform any type of cyberattack, such as data breaches and malware infections.</p>



<p>The well known cybercrime &#x2013; SolarWinds supply chain attack stands out in 2021 due to its scale and influence, but other sophisticated supply chain attacks have occurred such as Codecov in April, and most recently, Kaseya. Kaseya provides software for Managed Service Providers and the REvil ransomware gang exploited the company to infect over 1,000 customers with ransomware. The group demanded a ransom of $70 million to provide decryption keys for all affected customers.</p>



<p>Supply chain attacks will become more common and governments will have to establish regulations to address these attacks and protect networks. They will also look into collaborating with the private sectors and internationally to identify and target more threat groups operating on global and regional scales. In 2022, expect to discover more about the global impact of the infamous Sunburst attack.</p>



<ul><li>The cyber &#x2018;cold war&#x2019; intensifies</li></ul>



<p>The cyber way is intensifying, and taking place online as more nation-state actors push Western governments to continue to destabilize society. Improved infrastructure and technological capabilities will enable terrorists groups and political activists to further their cybercrime agendas and carry out more sophisticated, widespread attacks. Cyberattacks will increasingly be used as proxy conflicts to destabilize activities globally.</p>



<ul><li>Data breaches are larger scale and more costly</li></ul>



<p>Going into 2022 we will see an increase in data breaches that will be larger scale. These breaches will also have the potential to cost organizations and governments more to recover. In May 2021, a US insurance giant paid $40 million in ransom to hackers. This was a record, and we can expect ransom demanded by attackers to increase in 2022.</p>



<h2 id="technology-cybersecurity-predictions-for-2022">Technology cybersecurity predictions for 2022:</h2>



<ul><li>Mobile malware attacks increase as more people use mobile wallets and payment platforms:</li></ul>



<p>In 2021,&#xA0;<a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2021/check-point-softwares-mobile-security-report-2021-shows-almost-every-organization-globally-experienced-a-mobile-malware-attack-during-the-past-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">46% of organizations</a>&#xA0;had at least one employee download a malicious mobile application. The move to remote work for almost entire populations across the world during the COVID-19 pandemic saw the mobile attack surface expand dramatically, resulting in&#xA0;<a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/press/2021/check-point-softwares-mobile-security-report-2021-shows-almost-every-organization-globally-experienced-a-mobile-malware-attack-during-the-past-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">97% of organizations</a>&#xA0;facing mobile threats from several attack vectors. As mobile wallets and mobile payment platforms are used more frequently, cybercrimes will evolve and adapt their techniques to exploit the growing reliance on mobile devices.</p>



<ul><li>Cryptocurrency becomes a focal point for cyberattacks globally</li></ul>



<p>When money becomes purely software, the cybersecurity needed to protect us from hackers stealing and manipulating bitcoins and altcoins is sure to change in unexpected ways. As reports of stolen crypto wallets triggered by free airdropped NFTs become more frequent, Check Point Research (CPR) investigated&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/10/13/check-point-software-prevents-theft-of-crypto-wallets-on-opensea-the-worlds-largest-nft-marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenSea</a>&#xA0;and proved it was possible to steal crypto wallets of users by leveraging critical security. In 2022, we can expect to see an increase in cryptocurrency related attacks.</p>



<ul><li>Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in microservices to launch largescale attacks</li></ul>



<p>The move to the cloud and DevOps will result in a new form of cybercrime. With microservices becoming the leading method for application development, and microservices architecture being embraced by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), attackers are using vulnerabilities found in microservices to launch their attacks. We can also expect to see large scale attacks targeting CSPs.</p>



<ul><li>Deepfake technology weaponized</li></ul>



<p>Techniques for fake video or audio are now advanced enough to be weaponized and used to create targeted content to manipulate opinions, stock prices or worse. As in the case of other mobile attacks that rely on social engineering, the results of a phishing attacks can range from fraud to more advanced espionage. For instance in one of the most significant deepfake phishing attacks, a bank manager in the&#xA0;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/10/14/huge-bank-fraud-uses-deep-fake-voice-tech-to-steal-millions/?sh=2147d5e47559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Arab Emirates fell victim to a threat actor&#x2019;s scam</a>. Hackers used AI voice cloning to trick the bank manager into transferring $35 million. Threat actors will use deepfake social engineering attacks to gain permissions and to access sensitive data.</p>



<ul><li>Penetration tools continue to grow</li></ul>



<p>Globally in 2021,&#xA0;<a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/10/06/as-battle-against-cybercrime-continues-during-cybersecurity-awareness-month-check-point-research-reports-40-increase-in-cyberattacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 out of every 61 organizations</a>&#xA0;was being impacted by ransomware each week. Cybercrime through ransomware will continue to grow, despite the efforts of law enforcement to limit this growth globally. Threat actors will target companies that can afford paying ransom, and ransomware attacks will become more sophisticated in 2022. Hackers will increasingly use penetration tools to customize attacks in real time and to live and work within victim networks. Penetration tools are the engine behind the most sophisticated ransomware attacks that took place in 2021. As the popularity of this attack method grows, attackers will use it to carry out data exfiltration and extortion attacks.</p>

                <h2>How Mariah Carey stole Christmas</h2>

<p class="has-drop-cap">The year was 1993. Singer-songwriter Mariah Carey had just released her <em>Music Box </em>album, and her management team at Columbia Records was convening on a regular basis to brainstorm ideas for a follow-up. When the possibility of doing a Christmas album was brought up, the room fell silent. Carey and her long-time songwriting partner, Walter Afanasieff, had been toying with the concept for more than four years, but Afanasieff was hesitant &#x2014; and for good reason.</p>



<p>While artists from the 1950s and 1960s had turned out numerous beloved and commercially successful Christmas songs, artists from the 1990s rarely did. During this time period, producing holiday-themed music was seen as an act of desperation, undertaken only by those whose careers had long peaked and were now ready to sell out. Carey&#x2019;s career, by contrast, was just getting started, and her management feared a Christmas album &#x2014; while potentially lucrative &#x2014; could tarnish her rising stardom.</p>



<p>Ultimately, it was Carey&#x2019;s producer and then-husband Tommy Mottola that convinced her to take on the project. The story goes that the songwriters put their appreciation of Christmas before their fear of failure. Creating a Christmas album, Afanasieff said in a 2014 interview with <em><a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/mariah-carey-merry-christmas-anniversary-all-i-want-for-christmas-6296926/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a></em>, &#x201C;wasn&#x2019;t a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, &#x2018;Hey, you know, we&#x2019;re putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.&#x2019;&#x201D;</p>



<h2 id="h-the-lifespan-and-legacy-of-all-i-want-for-christmas">The lifespan and legacy of &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas&#x201D;</h2>



<p>The album&#x2019;s biggest hit, an up-tempo, pop, soul, and gospel-inspired song titled &#x201C;All I Want For Christmas Is You,&#x201D; only took Carey and Afanasieff 15 minutes to compose. It&#x2019;s lifespan, on the other hand, would prove to be anything except short-lived. Commercially, the single saw both instant and long-term success. In the U.S., the song has topped charts every year since its release in 1994. It also topped charts in 26 other countries, ranging from Australia to Germany.</p>



<p>A 2016 Nielsen report revealed the song performed well on every platform, including radio airplay and streaming services, and having sold more than 16 million copies, &#x201C;All I want for Christmas&#x201D; is not only the highest-grossing Christmas single performed by a female artist, but also one of the highest-grossing singles in general. It is arguably the biggest hit in Carey&#x2019;s career, earning the artist more than $60 million in royalties according to a <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/11/30/the-music-industry-should-be-dreaming-of-a-white-christmas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report in <em>The Economist</em></a> from 2017.</p>



<p>On another level, &#x201C;All I Want For Christmas&#x201D; and the feelings it evokes have made a noticeable impact on the way we experience the holiday season. The song became ubiquitous to the point radio stations now consider it to be just as quintessentially Christmas as &#x201C;Frosty the Snowman,&#x201D; &#x201C;Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer&#x201D; or &#x2014; moving closer to Carey&#x2019;s time &#x2014; Chris Rea&#x2019;s &#x201C;Driving Home For Christmas.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a luxury that singles from other popular musicians, like Train&#x2019;s &#x201C;Shake Up Christmas,&#x201D; do not enjoy.</p>



<p>Musician and YouTuber Adam Ragusea concurs. In a <a href="https://slate.com/culture/2015/12/mariah-careys-all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-a-musicological-explanation-of-why-the-song-sounds-so-christmassy.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review of the song written for <em>Slate</em></a>, he says that &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas&#x201D; is &#x201C;the only Christmas song written in the last half-century worthy of inclusion in the Great American Songbook.&#x201D; The extremely positive reception of her song caused Carey to be crowned the &#x201C;Queen of Christmas,&#x201D; a title she retained even as she moved on to other things. But just what about this song has caused it to go down in history as a modern Christmas classic?</p>



<h2>Explanations from musicologists</h2>



<p>One easy explanation could be that &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas&#x201D; borrows liberally from the composition of, well, classic Christmas music. Its explosive intro is reminiscent of Phil Spector&#x2019;s &#x201C;Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)<em>.</em>&#x201D; The song&#x2019;s structure, an AABA schemata, is the same as those used by songs like &#x201C;Frosty the Snowman&#x201D; and &#x201C;Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.&#x201D; However, these similarities only touch the surface of Carey&#x2019;s nostalgia inducing composition.</p>



<p>As noted by Ragusea in an interview for the YouTube channel of <em>Vox</em>, &#x201C;All I Want For Christmas&#x201D; also uses the same chords as the 1942 hit single, &#x201C;White Christmas,&#x201D; by Irving Berlin. &#x201C;White Christmas&#x201D;<em> </em>was written during the height of the jazz era, and traces of this bygone period of musical history &#x2014; such as the usage of larger and more varied numbers of chords &#x2014; made their way into the arrangement of &#x201C;All I Want For Christmas&#x201D; as well.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mariah Carey - All I Want For Christmas Is You (Official Video)" width="640" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yXQViqx6GMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div><figcaption>Three different music videos were made for &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas.&#x201D;</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the same video for <em>Vox</em>, Ragusea goes into even deeper details, explaining how the various chords used in &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas&#x201D; make him feel. The transition from minor 3<sup>rd</sup> to diminished 5<sup>th</sup> then followed by minor 7<sup>th</sup>, which takes place toward the end of the first chorus, is particularly unusual in modern pop music. This gives Carey&#x2019;s song a nostalgic feeling that reaches beyond the holiday itself to the time period in which this holiday was first invented.</p>



<p>This nostalgic feeling may be amplified by the musical styles that influenced the composition of &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas,&#x201D; namely soul and gospel. Originated amongst and popularized by Black American communities, these styles are characterized by their euphoric tones, catchy rhythms, and spiritual sentiment. This sentiment, also faintly present in Carey&#x2019;s song, harkens back to a time <a href="https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/why-its-better-to-give-gifts-than-to-receive-according-to-science/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before incessant commercialization</a>, when Christmas was exclusively treated as a religious holiday.</p>



<h2>Explanations from culture critics</h2>



<p>The hypotheses formulated by culture critics draw a connection between the enduring success of &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas&#x201D; and Carey&#x2019;s ability to tap into a rapidly changing zeitgeist. <em>TIME</em> reporter Cady Lang calls it an &#x201C;adult take on a Christmas song&#x201D; &#x2014; one that, &#x201C;by eschewing children-centric holiday iconography like Santa and Rudolph for Carey&#x2019;s trademark musical subject, love and romance&#x201D; was able to reach a new, more lucrative demographic.</p>



<p>Andrew Mall, an assistant professor of music at Northeastern University interviewed by Lang for the <a href="https://time.com/5708874/all-i-want-for-christmas-is-you-mariah-carey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same TIME article,</a> supports this view. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not a religious song,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;She talks about Christmas, but no religious beliefs. It&#x2019;s actually a love song. Anyone can inhabit those lyrics; the lover is not named, the lover is not gendered, so anyone can put themselves in that position as needing someone to love at the holidays. It&#x2019;s a secular love song and not a religious Christmas carol.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Other critics suggest the legacy of &#x201C;All I Want for Christmas&#x201D; was solidified with the help of the 2003 film <em>Love, Actually</em>. When this star-studded film about intertwining love stories was admitted to the club of quintessential Christmas media, so too was its main soundtrack and plot device. Jocelyn Neal, music professor at UNC Chapel Hill, has pointed out how the film&#x2019;s target audience &#x2014; middle-class Americans &#x2014; were the same people that listened to the radio and participated in music polls.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, Mariah Carey&#x2019;s song sounds &#x201C;Christmasy&#x201D; not because it is a direct manifestation of the holiday&#x2019;s metaphysical form, but because its borrowed style and composition make it sound like songs we already associated with Christmas. On a cultural level, Carey&#x2019;s penchant for love songs and her ability to combine different genres allowed her to sing directly to people who had long stopped believing in God or Santa Claus, but still needed someone to help them get through winter.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Mushrooms are delicious, nutritious mini-pharmaceutical factories. They produce well over a <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1155%2F2015%2F376387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundred compounds</a> with links to good health, from immune system enhancement to protection of the cardiovascular system.</p>



<p>Recent studies suggest blasting mushrooms with UV radiation can push production of these compounds into overdrive. And this could be key to solving the global vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency problem, according to a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/ijfs.15410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent review</a> published in the <em>International Journal of Food Science &amp; Technology.</em></p>



<h2>Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency</h2>



<p>Over <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3356951/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">half the world population</a> is vitamin D insufficient, which means they do not get enough vitamin D to maintain optimal health. About one billion are vitamin D deficient, which can result in more severe conditions like rickets. This might be a bit surprising, considering humans produce vitamin D in response to exposure to the UV radiation in sunlight (hence, why vitamin D is also known as the &#x201C;sunshine vitamin&#x201D;). Insufficiency and deficiency in vitamin D have been linked to increased risk for dozens of diseases &#x2014; osteoporosis, cancer, and COVID, just to name a few.</p>



<p>Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency mainly can be attributed to lifestyle and diet. As humans decrease their time outdoors and increase their sunscreen use, they are exposed to less UV radiation than they have been historically. Additionally, there are surprisingly few foods that naturally contain vitamin D (which is why milk is often fortified with it). Wild fatty fish, such as salmon and herring, and egg yolks are amongst the only animal sources of vitamin D. Unfortunately, farmed fish and chickens raised indoors have less than a quarter of the vitamin D found in their free-ranged brethren.</p>



<h2>Magic mushrooms</h2>



<p>Mushrooms are the <em>only</em> non-animal food source that provides a notable amount of vitamin D. In fact, some species of wild mushrooms contain <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/9-foods-high-in-vitamin-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>four times</em></a> the daily value (DV) of vitamin D in just a 3.5-ounce serving (the equivalent of a dozen baby button mushrooms). Equivalently, one serving of wild baby button mushrooms has as much vitamin D as two servings of wild salmon or ten servings of farmed salmon.</p>



<p>But just like fish and chickens, commercially grown mushrooms contain very little vitamin D &#x2014; because they are often grown in the dark. But there is a simple fix. Similar to humans, mushrooms produce vitamin D when exposed to UV radiation. &#x201C;When we humans are hit by UV light, our cholesterol starts producing vitamin D in the skin through a photochemical process. This is similar to what happens in the mushroom, but here it&#x2019;s the ergosterol that&#x2019;s converted into vitamin D by means of the energy from the UV light,&#x201D; <a href="https://sciencenordic.com/biology-denmark-food/uv-light-turns-mushrooms-into-vitamin-d-bombs/1374265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> Hanne L. Kristensen, a food scientist at Aarhus University.</p>



<p>The review authors discussed over a decade of strategies that utilized UV radiation to enrich vitamin D in mushrooms. In 2015, scientists <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889157515000769?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blasted Shiitake mushrooms with UV radiation</a> for two hours. The mushroom&#x2019;s vitamin D levels skyrocketed from containing 2.3% DV per serving to 100% DV per serving. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b04321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Another group</a> of researchers discovered a new method that enriched vitamin D levels to a whopping 4,600% DV per serving. Their secret? Suspending the mushrooms in ethanol during irradiation to protect the vitamin D from degradation.</p>



<p>The positive effect of irradiation doesn&#x2019;t end with a boost in vitamin D. Past <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0023643821010665?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">studies</a> have shown that the stress generated by UV irradiation can trigger the mushroom cells to go into a protective state, producing an abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory molecules. Additionally, the authors hypothesize that irradiated mushrooms are effective in preventing osteoporosis, due to the ideal combination of vitamin D and minerals that can exert constructive effects on bone density.</p>



<p>&#x201C;It is evident that UV irradiation is beneficial in enhancing the nutraceutical contents significantly,&#x201D; write the authors.</p>



<h2 id="h-diy-irradiated-mushrooms">DIY irradiated mushrooms</h2>



<p>Even better: You don&#x2019;t have to wait for irradiated mushrooms to hit the stores; you can irradiate your mushrooms at home.</p>



<p><a href="https://fungi.com/blogs/articles/place-mushrooms-in-sunlight-to-get-your-vitamin-d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Paul Stamets</a>, the founder of Fungi Perfecti who was featured in Netflix&#x2019;s 2019 documentary <em>Fantastic Fungi</em>, simply drying shiitake mushrooms in sunlight for 6 hours with the gills facing up can boost their vitamin D levels nearly 460%. This is one of the few biochemistry experiments that you can try at home.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap"><em>This <a href="https://www.freethink.com/space/satellite-launches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article</a> was originally published by our sister site, Freethink.</em></p>



<p>The future of satellite launches may be taking shape in New Mexico, where a startup just tested out a system designed to fling the objects into space, rather than blasting them into orbit with rockets.</p>



<p><strong>The challenge:</strong>&#xA0;To put&#xA0;<a href="https://www.freethink.com/space/mars-satellites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satellites</a>&#xA0;into space, we load them onto a rocket carrying a ton of propellant, then burn that propellant to create thrust. This allows the rocket to break free of Earth&#x2019;s gravity, and once it&#x2019;s high enough, it can release its payload.</p>



<p>The development of&#xA0;<a href="https://www.freethink.com/space/reusable-rockets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reusable rockets</a>&#xA0;has made this process a lot cheaper &#x2014; we used to just have to eat the cost of an entire rocket as part of a launch &#x2014; but&#xA0;<a href="https://www.freethink.com/space/biofuel-rocket" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuel</a>&#xA0;is still very expensive, and burning it releases a lot of greenhouse gases.&#xA0;</p>



<p><strong>Satellite launches</strong><strong>&#xA0;2.0:</strong>&#xA0;California-based spaceflight startup SpinLaunch is testing a different approach to satellite launches &#x2014; one that involves spinning them really fast and then letting them go at just the right moment.</p>

                                                <h2>&#x201C;The more crazy the project is, the better off you are just working on it &#x2014; rather than talking about it.&#x201D;</h2>
                                                <h3>JONATHAN YANEY</h3>
                                            </section>
                                        </section>



<p>It&#x2019;s sort of like the Olympic hammer-throw event, but with satellites instead of metal balls, and even SpinLaunch&#x2019;s own CEO Jonathan Yaney knows that that sounds bizarre, which is why the startup has largely operated&#xA0;<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-spinlaunch-the-space-industrys-best-kept-secret/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under the radar</a>&#xA0;for the past seven years.</p>



<p>&#x201C;I find that the more audacious and crazy the project is, the better off you are just working on it &#x2014; rather than being out there talking about it,&#x201D; he&#xA0;<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/spinlaunch-completes-first-test-flight-of-alternative-rocket.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told CNBC</a>. &#x201C;We had to prove to ourselves that we could actually pull this off.&#x201D;</p>



<p>The project&#x2019;s not seeming so crazy now, though.</p>



<p><strong>First flight:&#xA0;</strong>On October 22, SpinLaunch used a vacuum-sealed &#x201C;suborbital accelerator&#x201D; taller than the Statue of Liberty to spin a 10-foot-long projectile on a rotating arm until it reached a speed in the &#x201C;many thousands of miles an hour,&#x201D; according to Yaney.&#xA0;</p>



<p>When released out of the accelerator&#x2019;s barrel, the projectile flew to an altitude in the &#x201C;tens of thousands of feet,&#x201D; he said.</p>



<section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="bt-pullquote">
                                            <section>
                                                <h2>SpinLaunch says its approach will be 10 times cheaper and require 4 times less fuel.</h2>
                                                <h3></h3>
                                            </section>
                                        </section>



<p>Within the next eight months, SpinLaunch plans to conduct about 30 more tests of its suborbital accelerator in New Mexico &#x2014; which was only putting 20% of its total power behind this first test flight &#x2014; before building a larger orbital accelerator capable of putting satellites into orbit.</p>



<p>&#x201C;We can essentially validate our aerodynamic models for what our orbital launch vehicles are going to be like and it allows us to try out new technologies when it comes to release mechanisms,&#x201D; Yaney said.</p>



<p><strong>Scaling up:&#xA0;</strong>SpinLaunch expects its orbital system will be able to deliver about 440 pounds (200 kg) of payload into orbit per launch &#x2014; the weight of two small satellites. During those satellite launches, the projectile will coast for about a minute before splitting open. A booster affixed to the payload will then give it an extra push to guide it into its orbit.</p>



<p>Each payload will be a tiny fraction of what most rocket launches carry &#x2014; SpaceX&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href="https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Falcon 9</a>, for instance, can carry over&#xA0;<em>50,000</em>&#xA0;pounds (22,800 kg) to low-earth orbit.&#xA0;</p>



<p>However, SpinLaunch says its approach will be 10 times cheaper and require 4 times less fuel than what&#x2019;s currently used to put payloads of its size into orbit. It also produces &#x201C;zero emissions in the most critical layers of the atmosphere.&#x201D;</p>



<p>And because the system is so cheap, they can perform a lot of launches, making up with volume what it lacks in payload size. The company is looking for a site for its orbital accelerator that can support &#x201C;dozens of launches per day,&#x201D; and it expects to conduct its first customer launches in late 2024.</p>



<p><strong>Looking ahead:&#xA0;</strong>If SpinLaunch can cut the cost of putting small satellites in space, the ripple effect could be huge &#x2014;&#xA0;<a href="https://www.freethink.com/space/space-factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microgravity</a>&#xA0;gives scientists the ability to perform experiments that are impossible on Earth, and cheap access to it could lead to breakthroughs in tech, manufacturing, healthcare, and more.</p>



<p>SpinLaunch isn&#x2019;t the only company exploring unique ways to cut the cost of getting to space, either &#x2014; U.K. startup B2space is&#xA0;<a href="https://www.aero-mag.com/exploring-a-new-approach-to-innovation-in-the-space-sector" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing a balloon</a>&#xA0;to carry rockets into the upper atmosphere.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Like SpinLaunch&#x2019;s system, this would cut both the cost of fuel and the amount of emissions released in the lower layers of the atmosphere, suggesting the future of satellite launches might be cheaper and cleaner.</p>

<p>What comes to mind when you think of the average college student? If you imagine a 20-something who comes straight from high school to life as a full-time student on a residential campus, you might want to reconsider. Demographic changes in post-high school education have transformed how millions of American students experience college.&#xA0;</p>



<p>In U.S. colleges and universities, the share of part-time students is larger than ever. Most are working, which might explain how an increasing number of students, who are either listed as being financially independent from their parents or who are from the lowest socioeconomic classes, are able to attend school at all.</p>



<p>Looking at all U.S. college students, data show that:&#xA0;</p>



<ul><li>64 percent have a job</li><li>40 percent work full time</li><li>37 percent are older than 25</li><li>One-quarter have children or dependents&#xA0;</li><li>One-third come from families living in poverty&#xA0;</li><li>9 percent have reported not having stable housing at some point in the last year&#xA0;</li><li>36 percent have reported not knowing where they were going to find their next meal at some<a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/campaign/todays-student/"> point</a>&#xA0;</li></ul>



<p>In short, today&#x2019;s college student is older, holding down a job, and often supporting family members. The old stereotypes are outdated, but higher ed hasn&#x2019;t adapted. And given how important a post-high school credential is today&#x2014;almost all living-wage jobs require one&#x2014;the system has to change, both for these students and their families, and for the country&#x2019;s economy.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-brief-history-of-the-american-university-system"><strong>A brief history of the American university system</strong></h2>



<p>Most, though not quite all, of the older institutions of higher learning in the U.S. were built to train the clergy.</p>



<p>Harvard University, while technically nondenominational, tended toward training Congregationalists. Yale was specifically targeted to the same denomination and limited itself to teaching theology and languages for decades. Princeton was for Presbyterians, William and Mary was for Episcopalians alongside Columbia, and Rutgers was for<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_colleges"> Calvinists</a>. The more progressive Brown University was founded by Baptists, but was explicitly open to all. For decades, many American students considered religious denomination the most important factor in selecting a school &#x2014; even if they weren&#x2019;t going into the ministry.</p>



<p>It might go without saying that most of the people intended for these schools were fairly well-off young men, though on rare occasions scholarships made it possible for particularly bright children of the lower classes to get an education.</p>



<p>While change was slow in coming, the<a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/american-university/"> American university system</a> has done well for itself by being willing to experiment and change. Over time, student demographics also changed, though it took much longer than one might hope. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1855 that a public university, The University of Iowa, admitted men and women on an equal basis. Racial progress was often slower.</p>



<p>Despite this progress, there remain considerable racial and economic disparities in which Americans seek and hold degrees. Black, Hispanic and Latino, Native American, and Pacific Islander students are underrepresented at universities, though Hispanic students are increasingly well represented in some<a href="https://www.urban.org/research/publication/racial-and-ethnic-representation-postsecondary-education"> places</a>. The six-year graduation rates are also unequal, with whites and Asians having a higher graduation rate than other races. These disparities suggest that other racial gaps, such as those pertaining to wealth or employment, won&#x2019;t be reduced as quickly as some advocates might hope.</p>



<p>Altogether, 52 percent of American adults have a post-high school credential, including a two- or four-year degree, certificate or industry certification.&#xA0;</p>



<h2><strong>52 percent would be a failing grade at most schools</strong></h2>



<p>We have to do better. Research shows that more than two-thirds of living-wage jobs require a credential beyond high school. And despite what some think, that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean a college degree. High-quality certificates and industry certifications&#x2014;particularly if they are &#x201C;stackable&#x201D; toward degrees&#x2014;are an excellent pathway toward economic security.&#xA0;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.luminafoundation.org/">Lumina Foundation</a> is part of the national movement toward a bold goal: ensuring that 60 percent of working-age adults will have a college degree or other post-high school credential by 2025. But we can&#x2019;t get there without better supports for students, especially those who are the first in their families to attend college, come from low-income families or face other challenges such as food or housing insecurity.&#xA0;</p>



<p>As Danette Howard of Lumina told Big Think:</p>



<p>&#x201C;We know there are many, many students who have to take a break after high school, who maybe are parents themselves or who have to work full time and so therefore they weren&#x2019;t able to enroll completely after high school. Students of color are disproportionately represented in those groups, and so one of the indirect consequences of these policies is that they have excluded Black students, African American students, Latino students, and Native American students. So, we think that financial aid policies need to be revised for older students and many students who lead more complex lives. It&#x2019;s really important to acknowledge that no one person is one single thing&#x2026;We have to really think about the intersectionality of all aspects of a learner&#x2019;s identity. The system of post-secondary education has to be redesigned to take into account the very complex and fluid lives that students live.&#x201D;</p>



<p>The American college experience has fundamentally changed since the days of the Great Society domestic programs of nearly 60 years ago, when we devised many of the systems of financial aid and student support on which college students still rely. Some organizations are leading the charge in helping make the changes that will help those left out by the system get the education they deserve.</p>

                                    <p><b>DANETTE HOWARD:</b> I don&apos;t think that we want a society that is based upon stratification, where there are these huge,</p><p>significant differences by income and by educational level. And by the kinds of jobs  that people get. We have to do something to address educational inequities by race and ethnicity if we hope</p><p>to be a country that is fair and just, and where there is really equal opportunity for everyone.</p><p>When I was six months old, my mom returned back to school and started working on her bachelor&apos;s degree. It took my mom eight long years to earn her bachelor&apos;s degree. I remember the day she graduated, I was in the third grade, and it was an incredible celebration. The beautiful thing  about what happens when you are the first in your family to get a college degree is that it not only changes the trajectory of your life but the trajectory of the life of everyone in your family line who comes after you.</p><p>It&apos;s not enough that some of us have those credentials, that some of us are able to live the American dream. Everyone should have  the opportunity to determine the path that is best for him or her. If you look back at  the very beginning of higher education  in the United States, higher education was designed to prepare young white men for the clergy primarily. Over time, we have seen higher education become more diverse, but we still do see some stratification in the higher education system, which is connected to this historical legacy of exclusion.</p><p>We have to acknowledge all of these different facets of the post-secondary ecosystem that have to be redesigned and rebuilt to better serve today&apos;s students, to better serve students of color. There are many statewide financial aid policies, for example, that are only geared toward recent high school graduates. And we know that there are many, many students who have to take a break after high school who maybe are parents themselves, or who have to work full time. And so, therefore, they weren&apos;t able to enroll completely after high school. Students of color are disproportionately represented in those groups. And so, one of the indirect consequences of these policies is that they have  excluded Black students and African American students, Latino students, and Native American students. So we think that financial aid policies need to be revised  for older students and many students who lead more complex lives. It&apos;s really important to acknowledge that no one person is one single thing.</p><p>So yes, I am an African American, but I am also a woman. I&apos;m also a parent. We have to really think about the intersectionality of all aspects of a learner&apos;s identity. The system of post-secondary education has to be redesigned to take into account  the very complex and fluent lives that students live. We don&apos;t want a society of haves and have nots based upon who&apos;s had the opportunity to pursue  and complete a post-secondary credential and who has not.</p><p>My mom was able  to get a better job. She was earning a better income. We were able to move to a different neighborhood, but I think the most consequential outcome is that I&apos;ve never for a&#xA0;<span style="font-family: inherit;font-weight: inherit">moment in my life thought that that would not be my reality. I&apos;ve always known that I was going to have the opportunity to pursue my dreams and that many of those dreams would begin with my going on to college. It&apos;s important that those of us who have had these opportunities work to make them available for everyone.</span></p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">What, precisely, is in our Solar System? And how far out do we have to look before our Solar System truly comes to an end? For the first question, you might think that looking around close to the Sun is a great way to answer that question, but it&#x2019;s literally just the tip of the iceberg. For the second question, you can turn to the pull from the Sun itself and ask where the Sun&#x2019;s gravitational force becomes negligible compared to the influence from the other stars in the Milky Way. Between those two extremes &#x2014; the objects we can see and the edge of the Sun&#x2019;s gravity &#x2014; lies the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oort_cloud">Oort Cloud</a>.</p>



<p>At least, that&#x2019;s what we assume. First theorized in 1950 by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Oort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jan Oort</a>, we fully suspect that there&#x2019;s an enormous cloud of objects surrounding the Sun, from well beyond the Kuiper belt all the way to multiple light-years away. But what is it and where did it come from? That&#x2019;s what Patreon supporter Dwayne Williams wants to know, asking:</p>



<p>&#x201C;[P]lease write an article on the Oort Cloud. What is it? Why is it in that region of space? And what&#x2019;s it made of?&#x201D;</p>



<p>It&#x2019;s one of the most curious and bold predictions astronomy has ever made. But Oort didn&#x2019;t come up with this idea in a vacuum. When we look at what we know, it&#x2019;s virtually impossible to explain what&#x2019;s out there without an Oort Cloud.</p>

<p>It might not seem like it, but there&#x2019;s a reason why the first thing we should ask ourselves is the question of what, precisely, is in our Solar System? For example, when we see our Sun, our Moon, or a planet, we know &#x2014; even if we don&#x2019;t know precisely what the answer is &#x2014; that there exists a physical explanation for that object&#x2019;s existence. There&#x2019;s a reason why it&#x2019;s there with specific properties, even if that reason is pure random chance within a star-forming region. The combined influence of gravity, radiation pressure, angular momentum conservation, and the initial conditions that occurred within the molecular cloud that gave rise to us is what led to the planets forming.</p>



<p>Similarly, when we see objects like Saturn&#x2019;s moon Phoebe or Neptune&#x2019;s moon Triton, we can immediately recognize that they didn&#x2019;t form along with their parent planets from their orbital properties; they must have been gravitationally captured and originated elsewhere. We now know that Phoebe likely originated from much farther out, perhaps as a Centaur or a Kuiper belt object, and was gravitationally captured. Triton, similarly, must have originated from the Kuiper belt, which is no surprise given its similarities to Pluto and Eris. </p>



<p>If an object exists here, it must have an origin story to account for its existence.</p>

<p>This also holds true for comets that pass through our Solar System. Observed by humans since <a href="https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2009ASPC..409..297M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least pre-historic times</a>, it wasn&#x2019;t until the work of Edmund Halley that we began to realize that many of the comets that appeared in our night sky were periodic. Today, we know of over 100 independent periodic comets: comets that plunge through the inner reaches of the Solar System, developing tails and comas, reaching their closest approach to the Sun, and then heading back out once again, far beyond the limits of not only human vision, but beyond what even the most powerful telescopes ever built can image.</p>



<p>And yet, despite their orbits carrying them far out of our range, we can be confident of their eventual return. After all, the law of gravity has been known &#x2014; at least at the Newtonian level, itself remarkably accurate for describing objects in distant orbits around the Sun &#x2014; for over 300 years. Many of the periodic comets return on timescales of around a century or so, including:</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, these listed comets all have a number of properties in common with one another. They&#x2019;re on very eccentric orbits, with eccentricities of 0.9 or higher (where an eccentricity of 1.00 is the border between being gravitationally bound to our Sun, or not); they all have aphelions that carry them out beyond Saturn (with almost all of them going beyond Neptune, as well); and, at their farthest from the Sun, they all travel extremely slowly. Comet Halley, for example, last reached aphelion in 1948, where it was traveling at a mere 0.91 km/s. Swift-Tuttle is similar, with a minimum speed of 0.8 km/s.</p>



<p>So, with that said, where did these comets originate from?</p>



<p>The tremendous number of similarities between this class of comets strongly suggests that somewhere, out beyond the orbit of Neptune, there exists a large population of sub-planetary bodies moving very slowly with respect to the Sun, but still in a stable orbit. Every once in a while, something occurs &#x2014; perhaps a gravitational tug of some sort &#x2014; to perturb their orbits, hurling them into the inner Solar System. When that occurs, and they get close enough to the Sun, heat up, and begin expelling their volatiles. If enough time passes, either they&#x2019;ll get perturbed again &#x2014; potentially hurling them into one body or another or out of the Solar System entirely &#x2014; or they&#x2019;ll simply evaporate, boil, or sublimate away.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ve since discovered the source of most of those comets: the Kuiper belt. Starting in the 1990s and continuing through the present day, we now know that our outer Solar System contains a tremendous number of objects in a belt that extends well beyond Neptune. Perhaps ironically, the person it&#x2019;s named for &#x2014; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerard_Kuiper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gerard Kuiper</a> &#x2014; thought that it might no longer contain any objects, which he thought might have been swept clear by gravitational interactions.</p>



<p>It turns out there are other populations of comets as well. Some arise from the Centaurs, which are comet- and asteroid-sized objects primarily located between Jupiter and Neptune. Some arise from asteroids themselves; the parent body of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geminids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geminid meteor shower</a>, gracing our skies every December, is the asteroid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3200_Phaethon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3200 Phaethon</a>.</p>



<p>And some of them plunge into the Solar System only to disappear, never to appear again for all of human history. These comets were initially thought to be on parabolic or hyperbolic orbits &#x2014; where they would pass through once, never being gravitationally bound to our Sun &#x2014; eventually returning to interstellar space. But as our telescopes and observations continued to improve, we started discovering a remarkable set of facts about these comets. If you calculated their speeds as they were leaving the Solar System, their speed matched almost exactly the escape velocity needed to escape from the Sun. It was as though they fell into our Solar System from being practically at rest.</p>

<p>This makes no sense and led to a paradox. When we measure the stars of the Milky Way, all move with respect to the Sun: typically with speeds between 10 and 40 km/s. Why would there be a large population of interstellar objects, indistinguishable from our Kuiper belt objects in nature, where <em>none of them</em> were moving at all with respect to our Solar System?</p>



<p>Before Oort came along, a couple of people proposed there might be a population of objects originating from extremely far away, but still bound to our Sun. One was Armin Leuschner, who suggested these comets might actually be on very eccentric elliptical orbits. Another was Ernst &#xD6;pik, who theorized the existence of a &#x201C;cloud&#x201D; around our Solar System that acted as a reservoir for these objects.</p>



<p>But if a cloud existed, it would have to be right at the edge of what was gravitationally bound to our Solar System. In astronomy, a rule of thumb that we use to calculate gravitational stability is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_sphere" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hill sphere</a>, which is the region of space around an object where satellites can remain gravitationally bound to it. The Earth&#x2019;s Hill sphere goes out to about 1.5 million kilometers: roughly where the James Webb Space Telescope will be launched to &#x2014; beyond that, the Sun&#x2019;s gravity dominates. The Sun&#x2019;s Hill sphere goes out a few light-years, and beyond that, the stars in interstellar space start to become just as important.</p>

<p>The attribution of the cloud&#x2019;s existence is generally granted to Oort, however, on account of Oort putting forth the following paradox that, he reasoned, necessitated its existence.</p>



<ul><li>Given that the Solar System has existed for a long time, and that cometary bodies are small, their existence is unstable.</li><li>Dynamically, they will either collide with the Sun, a planet, or a moon, or be ejected entirely owing to planetary perturbations; they cannot survive for even millions, much less billions, of years.</li><li>Compositionally, comets are largely made of volatile ices, which means as they repeatedly approach the Sun, they&#x2019;ll either run out of volatiles and the comet will be destroyed, or the comet can develop an insulating crust to prevent further outgassing.</li></ul>



<p>Therefore, Oort reasoned, every comet that we see must be relatively &#x201C;new,&#x201D; in the sense that it only just started, recently in cosmic time, passing close by the Sun. Given that there are so many of them, and that they appear to have originated from a position nearly at rest with respect to the Sun, they therefore must be somehow held in some sort of reservoir: a collection of objects that&#x2019;s gravitationally bound to the Sun.</p>

<p>When we examine these comets today, the ones that we&#x2019;ve measured accurately appear to have aphelia that take them approximately ~20,000 astronomical units from the Sun, or about one-third of a light-year. Not all of them, mind you, but too many of them for it to be mere coincidence. There are rarer long-period comets with aphelia that are more like ~10,000 astronomical units, which is precisely what you might expect for a long-period comet that&#x2019;s had its orbit affected by the gravitational influence of the planets: drawn inward by a slight amount.</p>



<p>The big open questions, then, are twofold:</p>



<ol><li>How big is the Oort cloud? How are the objects distributed within it, and how far, both inward and outward, is its extent?</li><li>How did it develop, and when? Does every stellar system have one, or is our Sun &#x201C;lucky&#x201D; to have one, in some regard?</li></ol>



<p>Although we have answers that we think are pretty good to these questions, the fact remains that the best ideas we have about them remain unconfirmed. However, as our telescopes improve, both in size and in wavelength coverage, and as we continue to learn more about newly forming stellar systems and about the objects in interstellar space, we inch closer and closer to the answers.</p>

<p>One of the remarkable facts about the long-period comets (hypothetically from the Oort Cloud), the Kuiper belt comets, and the comets that originate from closer to Jupiter is this: they all appear to be made of the same types and ratios and isotopes of materials. They all appear to have formed at approximately the same time: 4.6 billion years ago. And, therefore, they formed from the same nebula in space that the rest of our Solar System formed from.</p>



<p>But then it gets murky.</p>



<ul><li>Were the Oort cloud&#x2019;s objects formed <em>in situ</em>, or were they hurled there from closer in by gravitational interactions with planets?</li><li>Did they all form from the part of the pre-solar nebula that formed our Sun and Solar System, or was there a dynamical exchange of material with other young stellar systems?</li><li>Did the Solar System always have an Oort Cloud, or did the cloud&#x2019;s mass grow as the Solar System evolved for quite a time, before interactions with passing stars began to deplete it?</li><li>Did the objects of the Oort Cloud form from collisional debris of other objects in the outer Solar System?</li><li>Did the scattered disk of objects, from which many Halley-type comets arise, contribute substantially to the Oort Cloud&#x2019;s population?</li><li>And where is the transition from the inner Oort Cloud, which is more disk-like, to the outer Oort Cloud, which is more spheroidal? </li></ul>



<p>Although estimates typically place the inner Oort Cloud from 0.03-to-0.32 light-years away and the outer Oort Cloud from 0.32-to-0.79 light-years away, these figures are disputed, with some contending that the inner Oort Cloud doesn&#x2019;t begin until ~0.08 light-years from the Sun, and some contending that the outer Oort Cloud extends for over ~3 light-years from the Sun!</p>

(<a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2007/09/The_Oort_cloud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit</a>: Southwest Research Institute)</figcaption></figure>



<p>One fascinating thing to consider that isn&#x2019;t disputed, however, is this: Over time, and specifically over at least the most recent 3.8 billion years, the Oort Cloud has consistently been depleted. The Sun typically experiences a close encounter with another major interstellar object, like another star, a little more often than once every ~1 million years, indicating that there have been thousands of such events in our history. Each such encounter would impart large gravitational &#x201C;kicks&#x201D; to any loosely bound object, potentially triggering cometary storms but certainly depleting the Oort Cloud. In environments such as globular clusters or near the galactic center, the persistence of Oort Clouds for billions of years may be nigh impossible.</p>



<p>Although its origin and full extent are still being studied, we can confidently state that it&#x2019;s made of the same protoplanetary material that the other primordial bodies in our Solar System are made of. The Oort Cloud objects are similar in composition to the other comets, centaurs, and Kuiper belt objects that we see: a mix of ices and rocks. The rocky material is likely very similar to planetary mantles, including Earth&#x2019;s, while the ices are likely to be a mix of nitrogen, water-ice, carbon/oxygen ices, and possibly even hydrogen ice. For any stellar system that forms, an Oort Cloud likely forms along with it. Only with more science, including better simulations and observations, will we ever know for certain.</p>

<p>For many people, the thought of dying fills them with dread and trepidation. <em>What will it feel like? Will I be scared? Does everything just go black?</em> Assuaging some of those fears, emerging science suggests that the elderly, dying brain often grants us a comfortable demise. And it does this through dreaming.</p>



<p>Accounts across history describe meaningful dreams and visions that arrive at the closing of one&#x2019;s life. All too often, these experiences are brushed aside as byproducts of brain-addled delirium or side effects of medication. But in 2014, researchers at Daemen College and at Hospice Buffalo <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vivid-dreams-comfort-the-dying/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked 63 patients</a> admitted to hospice care over a period of 18 months for their perspectives on any dreams or visions that they might be having. Participants described most of them as a source of personal comfort. In their dreams, hospice patients reported being in the presence of deceased loved ones, preparing themselves for a long journey, or seeing dead spouses, siblings, or parents waiting for them.</p>



<p>&#x201C;[These dreams] bring about a sense of peace, a change in perspective or an acceptance of death, suggesting that medical professionals should recognize dreams and visions as a positive part of the dying process,&#x201D; Emma Badgery <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/vivid-dreams-comfort-the-dying/">wrote</a> for <em>Scientific American</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-near-death-experiences-just-psychedelic-trips">Are near-death experiences just psychedelic trips?</h2>



<p>Following these dreams at the twilight of life are more vivid ones that could arrive at the moment of death, itself. Science points to our final moments being quite a mentally sensorial finale. For starters, there are the accounts of people who have been to the brink of death and back. Many of them report having wild visions, which have been termed &#x201C;near-death experiences&#x201D; (NDEs). Philosopher and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/article/dd52796e-5935-414e-af0c-de9686d02afa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychiatrist Raymond Moody coined the phrase</a> almost a half-century ago and discovered a few common elements of NDEs: a bright light, a sense of detachment from the body, feelings of security and warmth, and encounters with mystical beings. To religious people, this experience might seem like being welcomed into an afterlife, while nonreligious people might just enjoy the trip.</p>



<p>Likening NDEs to &#x201C;trips&#x201D; is actually a reasonable comparison. A <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01424/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highly-cited 2018 study</a> provided participants with low doses of the hallucinogenic drug <a href="https://bigthink.com/health/dmt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">N,N-dimethyltryptamine</a> (DMT) in a controlled setting, then asked them to describe their experience. Their descriptions were uncannily similar to collected descriptions of NDEs. We are now learning that there is a good reason for that.</p>



<p>It turns out that DMT is <a href="https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/lab-report/mystical-psychedelic-compound-found-normal-brains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">widely present</a> in the mammalian brain. In 2019, researchers at the University of Michigan not only found the compound in various locations in rat brains, but they also discovered neurons with the two enzymes required to make it. Moreover, the neurons seem to produce DMT at levels comparable to those of other key neurotransmitters like dopamine, which drives pleasure, and serotonin, which stabilizes mood.</p>



<p>DMT has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5048497/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also been found</a> in small amounts in human brain tissue and larger amounts in cerebrospinal fluid, a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Is it possible that DMT floods the human brain at death, causing vivid dreams and NDEs?</p>



<p>The University of Michigan researchers witnessed this happen in rats. They directly measured brain levels of DMT as rats suffered cardiac arrest and saw the substance spike up to ten times above baseline levels, enough to trigger psychedelic effects. If a similar increase also occurs in humans, it might just account for NDEs and vivid dreaming near death. But a larger dose might be necessary in alert, healthy subjects.</p>



<p><a href="https://realitysandwich.com/does-the-human-brain-make-dmt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to lead scientist Jimo Borjigin</a>, a molecular and integrative physiologist:</p>



<p><em>&#x201C;During near-death states, the brain activity that supports non-essential activities, such as walking, is severely reduced. So far scientists have studied experiences when people are fully awake, when they have many other types of brain activity going on. So in order to have a psychedelic experience, you need high levels of DMT that rise above the other noise that our brain is generating. At the near-death state, the level of DMT needed to contribute to a near-death experience may not be at the same level as for normal people having a normal psychedelic experience.&#x201D;</em></p>



<p>So just a small hit of brain-produced DMT could make our final minutes on Earth a psychedelic adventure.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Research <a href="https://www.urbandesignmentalhealth.com/facts-and-figures.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accumulated by the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health</a> confirms it: People living in big cities are far more susceptible to mental illnesses than those living in more quiet, rural areas. Specifically, city-dwellers are almost 40% more likely to suffer from depression and other mood disorders and twice as likely to develop schizophrenia.</p>



<p>For decades, psychologists, philosophers, and urban planners have hypothesized as to why urban environments could be associated with poor mental health. During this time, many viable explanations have been brought forth. For one, city-dwellers are routinely placed in emotional states that eat away at their psychological wellbeing, such as stress, isolation, and uncertainty.</p>



<p>How exactly city life brings out these conditions is not at all clear. While some people move to the city in search of opportunity, others do so to escape intolerable conditions such as war, poverty, or abuse. Rather than curing their neuroses, however, the perils and pitfalls of city life may actually have the adverse effect of exacerbating them.</p>



<p>At the same time, there seems to be something about cities that brings out the worst in people regardless of whether they arrived with predetermined trauma in tow. One of the academic texts which comes closest to describing this &#x201C;something&#x201D; is &#x201C;<a href="https://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/bpl_images/content_store/sample_chapter/0631225137/bridge.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Metropolis and Mental Life</a>,&#x201D; an essay that was published in 1903 and written by the German sociologist Georg Simmel.</p>



<h2 id="h-georg-simmel-and-the-blas-outlook">Georg Simmel and the blas&#xE9; outlook</h2>



<p>Growing up in the burgeoning metropolis of Berlin during the so-called Belle &#xC9;poque, Georg Simmel did not share his contemporaries&#x2019; unwavering belief in civilization. Where others saw society as continuously improving with the help of science and commerce, Simmel could not help but feel as though humanity had taken a wrong turn and was now paying for its mistake.</p>



<p>Simmel attempted to elucidate this position in &#x201C;The Metropolis,&#x201D; which originally came into being as a lecture for Dresden&#x2019;s First German Municipal Exposition, a cultural and industrial showcase for the development of German cities. Asked to discuss the role of academia in tomorrow&#x2019;s cities, Simmel settled on a different, more critical take on the subject.</p>



<p>In the essay, Simmel compares living in a rural village to a big city and tries to show how each environment shapes the psychology of its inhabitants for better or worse. His central thesis is that city-dwellers, because they are exposed to so many more audiovisual stimuli than their countryside counterparts, involuntarily erect psychological defenses against their surroundings that make life less rewarding.</p>



<p>Likening the human nervous system to an electrical circuit, Simmel supposes that this system &#x2014; if overstimulated for a prolonged period of time &#x2014; will cease to function. As a result, things that once emotionally or intellectually stimulated the city-dweller quickly cease to excite them. Simmel refers to this outlook as blas&#xE9;, but today, people also use the term jaded.</p>



<p>&#x201C;The essence of the blas&#xE9; attitude,&#x201D; writes Simmel, &#x201C;is an indifference toward the distinctions between things. Not in the sense that they are not perceived, as is the case of mental dullness, but rather that the meaning and value of the distinctions between things&#x2026; are experienced as meaningless. They appear to the blas&#xE9; person in a homogeneous, flat and grey color.&#x201D;</p>



<h2>Money as the frightful leveler</h2>



<p>This attitude is partly the result of overstimulation and partly a defense mechanism against it. The number of people which city-dwellers must interact with on a daily basis is so large that it is both impossible and impractical to develop a personal connection with every one they meet. Consequently, most interactions with others are brief and impersonal.</p>



<p>This is in sharp contrast to the village, where inhabitants are intimately familiar with each other. For instance, a baker is not just a baker but also a neighbor. He is not simply a member of the service industry that sells bread in exchange for money, but a member of the community, and his personality and history are as (if not more) important to customers than the service he offers.</p>



<p>While relationships in towns are governed by emotions, those in cities are based on reason. &#x201C;All emotional relationships between persons rest on their individuality,&#x201D; writes Simmel, &#x201C;whereas intellectual relationships deal with persons as with numbers, that is, as with elements which, in themselves, are indifferent, but which are of interest only insofar as they offer something objectively perceivable.&#x201D;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1001" height="768" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1001px-Landliches_Idyll_England_19c.jpg" alt class="wp-image-155699" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1001px-Landliches_Idyll_England_19c.jpg 1001w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1001px-Landliches_Idyll_England_19c.jpg?resize=375,288 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1001px-Landliches_Idyll_England_19c.jpg?resize=640,491 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1001px-Landliches_Idyll_England_19c.jpg?resize=768,589 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1001px) 100vw, 1001px"><figcaption>Though Simmel&#x2019;s conception of small towns is somewhat romantic, his comparison still stands. (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:L%C3%A4ndliches_Idyll_England_19c.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit</a>: Duesseldorf Auktionshaus / Wikipedia).</figcaption></figure>



<p>Because city-dwellers are unable to establish meaningful relationships with a large number of people in their vicinity, their interactions with different elements of society become economic rather than communal. Consequently, the trust which city-dwellers are able to vest in one another is transferred over to the currencies they exchange instead.</p>



<p>Georg Simmel refers to currency as &#x201C;the frightful leveler&#x201D; because it expresses everything in the same monetary unit. Goods and services, rather than being unique to the person that provided them, acquire a value that can instantly be compared to all other things. Thus, the market economy, fully developed in big cities, also contributes to the city-dweller&#x2019;s inability to distinguish their surroundings.</p>



<h2>The price of polity</h2>



<p>To offer an example of a complex society that did not have a similarly deteriorating influence on its inhabitants, Simmel had to travel all the way back to Ancient Greece. The antique concept of the polis or city-state, perhaps because it was always threatened by other municipalities, seems to him to have offered a mode of being that did not exclusively revolve around money.</p>



<p>Modern cities are built on individuality, which is expressed in the specialization of its labor as well as the financial independence of its inhabitants. The polis, by comparison, was more like a large, small town. Rather than separating its populations into distinct economic units, these city-states promoted the notion that everyone was part of the same social institution.</p>



<p>As the world&#x2019;s metropolises continue to grow, so too do the public health crises that fester in their bowels. &#x201C;The deepest problems of modern life,&#x201D; Georg Simmel wrote more than 100 years ago, &#x201C;flow from the attempt of the individual to maintain the independence and individuality of his existence against the sovereign powers of society, against the weight of the historical heritage and the external culture and technique of life.&#x201D;</p>



<p>This attempt to remain independent is, of course, a double-edged sword. While city-dwellers have more economic freedom compared to townsfolk, that freedom comes at a hefty cost. Without the personable and supportive networks found in the country, cities are <a href="https://bigthink.com/neuropsych/brain-cities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transformed into psychological minefields</a>. One wrong step, and its inhabitants can fall pray to loneliness, purposelessness, or &#x2014; worst of all &#x2014; indifference.</p>

                    <p>April Fools&#x2019; day is a beloved and loathed holiday in many countries. The yearly tradition of pranks, hoaxes, and jokes goes back all the way to the reign of Roman emperor Constantine and the occasion of his allowing a jester to reign as king for a day. In honor of the great jokers, pranksters, and the suckers that fell for it of ages past; we have seven of the greatest April Fools&#x2019; pranks of all time.&#xA0;</p>

</div><em>Two women inspect the harvest (Getty Images)</em><p></p>
<p>In 1957, the BBC news program <em>Panorama </em>announced that the dreaded spaghetti weevil had been eradicated from southern Switzerland, <a href="http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/the_swiss_spaghetti_harvest">leading to a tremendous crop of spaghetti</a>. The prank was rather elaborate <a href="https://youtu.be/tVo_wkxH9dU">and featured footage of farmers harvesting pasta from trees</a>. Many fooled viewers called in asking how to grow their own spaghetti trees, with the BBC encouraging them to <strong>&#x201C;place a string of spaghetti in a tin of tomato sauce and hope for the best.&#x201D;</strong></p>
<p>This hoax, while harmless, was criticized for abusing the trust that viewers had in the program and of anchor Richard Dimbleby. The BBC considered it hilarious and has never expressed regret over it.</p>

</div>
<p>One of the first, if not the first, hoaxes on the internet, this prank goes back to a message board in 1984. In a post allegedly written by General Secretary&#xA0;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Chernenko">Konstantin Chernenko</a>, it was announced that the USSR was joining the early internet with domestic sites and connections. This shocking report, not only that the USSR was opening up to the west in such a way but also that the Russians would have a potently dangerous level of access to American computer systems, fooled many people.</p>
<p>This hoax began a long and prestigious line of pranks offered by the internet every year. Of course, some of them have become a little more elaborate than a post on a webpage. All these fantastic jokes owe a debt to&#xA0;<a href="http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/kremvax/">this short post.</a></p>
<h2>Flying penguins</h2>

<p><em>Penguins are both adorable and incapable of flight (Getty Images)</em></p>
<p>Another BBC prank, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dfWzp7rYR4">this one was a trailer for a nature documentary</a> explaining the discovery of flying penguins in Antarctica. The related informational releases explained the birds had evolved the ability to fly so they could enjoy winter retreats to the Amazon. The birds were said to be very isolated and unreachable by most explorers, but the intrepid BBC crew had risked life and limb to document the spectacle of the migration.</p>
<p>To make it even more obvious that it was a prank, the entire short was hosted by Terry Jones of <em>Monty Python&#x2019;s </em><strong><em>Flying</em></strong><em> Circus</em>.</p>
<h2>Sidd Finch&#x2019;s baseball skills</h2>
<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">

</div>
<p><a href="http://hoaxes.org/archive/permalink/sidd_finch">This prank</a> was pulled off by Sports Illustrated in one of their more famous articles. Finch was a pitching prospect found by the New York Mets in 1985. Raised in an English orphanage and a student of Tibetan Yoga, Finch was said to have baseball skills beyond belief. Among other things, he could throw a fastball at 160 miles per hour without warming up and pitched while wearing only one shoe.</p>
<p>The Mets created a uniform for him to be used in the fake images for the article. The elaborate hoax included pictures of Finch at practice and holes in walls caused by his fastballs blowing through them. At least two general managers of other clubs called the league offices asking how their players could safely bat against Finch and swarms of reporters tried to find the man for interviews. &#xA0;</p>
<p>Fans were disappointed to learn April 8<sup>th</sup> that Finch had decided to abandon baseball. They learned week after that they were fooled.</p>

<p><em>The volcano&#xA0;as it is normally seen. (Public domain)&#xA0;</em></p>
<p>In perhaps one of the greatest pranks of all time, in 1974, residents of Stika, Alaska saw smoke rising from the top of the dormant volcano<a href="http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/the_eruption_of_mount_edgecumbe/">,</a><a href="http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/the_eruption_of_mount_edgecumbe/">Mt. Edgecumbe</a>, not far from their town. Almared by the lack of warning signs that the volcano might awake, the coast guard sent a helicopter over the mountain to investigate. The pilot ended people&#x2019;s concerns when the words &#x201C;April Fool&#x201D; were seen on the rim of the volcano in 50-foot letters.<br><br><br><br>Local resident Oliver Bickar, who had planned the prank for several years, had set a large pile of tires he had placed near the summit of the mountain on fire. This prank was well received and was even featured in adverting for flights to Alaska. &#xA0;</p>

<p><em>A recreation of the event for the camera. (hoaxes.org)</em></p>
<p>In 1950 the <em>Aftenposten, </em>the largest newspaper in Norway, reported that the state monopoly on wine sales had accidentally received too much wine from France and had run out of bottles to place it in. This was not unheard of, as bottle shortages would have been common after World War Two. The paper continued to note that the surplus wine would be sold at a 75% markdown to anybody who came in with a container to carry it out. <br><br><br><br>Stores sold out of buckets as people lined up to get cheap booze. <a href="http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/norwegian_wine_surplus">The same buckets were found left in the streets when people realized they had been duped.</a></p>

<p>In 1983 a young Associated Press reporter telephoned Joseph Boskin, a professor of history, to ask him about the origins of the holiday. Boskin explained that the first April Fools&#x2019; day was celebrated during the Reign of Roman Emperor Constantine, who had appointed one of his jesters, a fool named Kugel, king for the day. One of the decrees of King <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel">Kugel</a> was that the day would be dedicated to absurdity in all years to come.</p>
<p>What the AP didn&#x2019;t realize was that their source had <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2013/04/01/king-kugel-an-april-fools-history-lesson/?utm_term=.778d26d17d71">made up the story and fooled not only the respected news organization but also all their readers.</a> You are now included in that set.</p>
<p><a href="http://hoaxes.org/af_database/permalink/origin_of_april_fools_day">Here are some real potential origins of the holiday</a>, none are agreed on, and<a href="http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/where-did-april-fools-day-come-from"> some are downright implausible.</a>&#xA0;Whatever the origin, remember not to believe everything you read today or any other day for that matter and beware your prankster friends.</p>

                                    <p>- What might be wrong with mixing human and animal parts? There are changes we could make to human beings by mixing in animal DNA that might make them better and there are changes we can make to human beings that might make them worse.</p>
<p>- You&apos;re made out of DNA from thousands and millions of ancestors and it&apos;s the collaboration between DNA from all your ancestors that keeps you alive.</p>
<p>- We are experiencing right now a remarkable deluge of discovery in terms of the causes of disease, much of it coming out of genomics.<br><br><strong>BRYAN SYKES</strong>: Genetics and DNA does get to the central issue of what makes us tick. It&apos;s perhaps too determinist to say that your genes determine everything you do. They don&apos;t, but, if you like, it&apos;s like the deck of cards that you&apos;re dealt at birth. What you do with that deck, like any card game, depends a lot on your choices, but it is influenced by those cards, those genes that you got when you were born.</p>
<p>What I&apos;ve enjoyed about genetics is looking to see what it tells us about where we&apos;ve come from because those pieces of DNA, they came from somewhere. They weren&apos;t just sort of plucked out of the air. They came from ancestors. And it&apos;s a very good way of finding out about your ancestors, not only who they are, but just imagining their lives. You&apos;re made up of DNA from thousands and millions of ancestors who&apos;ve lived in the past, most of them now dead, but they&apos;ve survived, they&apos;ve got through, they&apos;ve passed their DNA onto their children, and it&apos;s come down to you. It doesn&apos;t matter who you are. You could be the President. You could be the Prime Minister. You could be the head of a big corporation. You could be a taxi driver. You could be someone who lives on the street. But the same is true of everybody. I can see a time, long after I&apos;ve gone but when, in fact, everyone will know their relationship to everybody else. It is possible, if anybody wants to do it or can afford it, you could actually, I think, draw the family tree of the entire world by linking up the segments of DNA. So you could find out in what way everyone was related to everybody else. </p>
<p>No doubt, most of the funding for the advances in genetics, for example, the complete sequencing of the human genome, has come from ambition to learn more about health issues. The technology for exploring that, which is making leaps and bounds, has come through the healthcare benefits. Those are the two main things that people are learning about themselves and who they&apos;re related to, where they&apos;ve come from. And that does, and I know from experience, that does add a lot to people&apos;s sense of identity. It&apos;s not for everybody, not everyone&apos;s very interested in it, but a lot of people are and I think that&apos;s a very good thing.</p>
<p><strong>FRANCIS COLLINS:</strong> It&apos;s too bad that you can&apos;t actually see DNA easily under a microscope and scan across the double-helix and read out of the sequence of bases that amounts to the information content because it would be easier, I think, to explain then how a geneticist goes about tracking down the molecular bases of a disease at the DNA level. Our methods are indirect. They&apos;re very powerful, they&apos;re very highly accurate, but they&apos;re not as visual as you might like. We do have methods though now that allow you to read out with high accuracy all 3 billion of the letters of the DNA instruction book. Those letters are actually these chemical bases. The chemical language of DNA is a simple one. There&apos;s only four letters in the alphabet. Those bases that we abbreviate, A, C, G, and T. And we have methods of being able to compare then the DNA sequence of people who have a disease versus people who don&apos;t and look for the critical differences in order to nail down something that might be the cause. Well, since, however, we all differ in our DNA sequence by about a half of 1%, you wouldn&apos;t get very far if you basically sequenced my DNA and the DNA of somebody with Parkinson&apos;s disease trying to figure out what the differences were because there would be way too many of them. But if you&apos;re willing to do that for a large number of people, you kind of average out all the noise and the difference that matters begins to be more and more clear. That&apos;s an overly-simplified description of how a geneticist goes about zeroing in on the actual molecular cause of a complex or a simple disease. This worked most readily for diseases that are highly heritable, cystic fibrosis, Huntington&apos;s disease. Those are conditions where a single mutation very reproducibly results in the disease. It&apos;s been a lot tougher for diseases where the inheritance is muddy. If you take diabetes for instance, which is what my lab primarily works on, or you take asthma or high blood pressure, that is not a set of conditions where one gene is involved in risk. There are dozens of genes involved in that and no single one of them contributes very much, but you put it all together and the consequences to that individual may tip them over the threshold into having the illness. </p>
<p>We are experiencing right now a remarkable deluge of discovery in terms of the causes of disease, much of it coming out of genomics, the ability to pinpoint at the molecular level what pathway has gone awry in causing a particular medical condition. And that in itself is exciting because it&apos;s new information, but what you really want to do is to take that and push that forward into clinical benefit. Some of that can be in prevention by identifying people at highest risk and trying to be sure they&apos;re having the right preventative strategy. But people are still going to get sick and so you want to come up with also better treatments than what we have now. And some of it is the ability through personalized medicine to begin to identify individual risks for future illness to get us beyond the-one-size-fits all approach to prevention, which has been not that effective. People haven&apos;t necessarily warmed to these recommendations about what you should do about diet, exercise, colonoscopies, mammograms, and so on because it all sounds very much generic. But if you could provide people with information about their personal risks and allow them, therefore, to come up with a personalized plan for maintaining health, that seems to inspire a lot more interest. </p>
<p>Personalized medicine is a term that gets used differently by different people. In my view, this is an effort to try to take diagnosis, prevention, and treatment and, when possible, factor into that individual information about that person in order to optimize the outcome. I think in some instances, we&apos;re not very far along with that. In others, we&apos;re making real progress. Take, for instance, the effort to try to choose the right drug at the right dose for the right person, what we&apos;d call pharmacogenomics. There are now more than 10% of FDA-approved drugs that have some mention in the label about the importance of paying attention to genetic differences in order to optimize the outcome. Take, for instance, the drug Abacavir, which is used to treat HIV-AIDS, a very powerful antiretroviral, but a drug that caused a pretty serious hypersensitivity reaction in about 6% or 7% of those who took it. We now know exactly how to predict that on the basis of a genetic test and so there is now a what-called black box label on the FDA, a label for this drug saying you must do that genetic test before you prescribe this drug in order to avoid that outcome. That was unimaginable a few years ago, that you would have that kind of precision in making that choice of a drug.</p>
<p><strong>GLENN COHEN:</strong> Recent set of controversies has to do with the funding by the federal government about research that mixes human and animal genetic materials, sometimes called chimeras, but there&apos;s actually a broader group. So again, the method is to think about a large number of cases. It&apos;s helpful to think about very different cases. So, to use some real cases, imagine you mixed human brain cells, so human brain stem cells in the embryonic stage, into a mouse to create a mouse with a humanized brain. Now, it wouldn&apos;t be a human brain. It&apos;s not exactly the same. It&apos;s much smaller, for example, but has humanized elements. Another example is a humanized immune system. Take a mouse, and we do this, we have these at Harvard for example, and created an immune system in order to test drugs. Think about HIV, for example, that was humanized. So not the brain, but just the immune system was very human-like. And last example is actually heart valve replacements. So Jesse Helms, the Senator, had a pig valve placement years ago, so there&apos;s a piece of an animal in him. So these are some real cases of different kinds of mixing and the question is which are okay, which are not okay, why can we generate some principles? </p>
<p>So what might be wrong with mixing human and animal parts? So one thing that might be wrong is that we think it will confuse the boundaries between humans and animals, that right now we have a pretty clear distinction. While many people love their dogs and their cats like members of the family, they are able to say this is not a member of my family. This is not a member that has the same rights as my family member. In a world where we had a much more of a continuum between animals and human beings, those distinctions would become difficult. Now, just because they become difficult doesn&apos;t mean that that&apos;s wrong. It would just pose for us a new problem and maybe it would illustrate a problem we should be thinking about altogether. So I&apos;m not particularly sympathetic to that argument. Different argument though is to say human beings are particular kinds of beings with particular kinds of capacities and there&apos;s a dignity to being human being. And if we were to mix enough animal material into a human being, the thing that we would have would not be something new, but it would be a human being that could not flourish as a human being. It would be an undignified human being, a kind of entity that is one that really is unable to really experience what it is to be human. Now, again, you might push on this and say, well, yes, that&apos;s true, they would not be a human being and they would not necessarily have all the capacities of a human being. So imagine having some of the capacities of a human being, but being stuck in a rat body, for example. Sure, there&apos;d be ways in which you would not flourish as a human being, but why not think of you as flourishing as a new kind of entity? And in particular you might actually think there might be an obligation to create some kinds of chimeras. So if, for example, we think of Big Bird from Sesame Street, sounds like a silly example, but it&apos;s a good one. Big Bird talks, Big Bird has friends, Big Bird goes to school, been in school a long time on Sesame Street, I guess, but he seems to have a pretty good life. Imagine we could take regular birds and turn them into big birds by doing something to them. Would we think of that as improving a little bird&apos;s life or would we think about that as hurting a human being&apos;s life through this mixture? Hard questions, but at least it might be possible that we think we&apos;re doing animals a favor by doing this. And other answers might say it depends a lot on the specifics of the case. There are changes we could make to human beings by mixing in animal DNA that might make them better and there are changes we can make to human beings that might make them worse and worse from a moral perspective. So, for example, if it turned out that there was, to use an example in literature, we could give human beings night vision so they could see at night like some animals through mixing in a little animal DNA, you might think that would be great. We could do more search and rescue. We&apos;d be better drivers. There&apos;ll be less fatalities. On the other hand, if the result was to produce human beings that had much stronger aggression or violence or claws or something like that, you might think that&apos;s worse because we&apos;re going to do more harm. And that would suggest the answer about whether we ought to have chimeras or not and what kind can only be answered in a particularistic way by thinking about a particular case.</p>
<p>I will say, and this is kind of referencing some work by my friend Hank Greely at Stanford, that there are particular kinds of changes which from a sociological perspective seem to bother us more. And he describes them as kind of brains, balls, and faces. So brains, it turns out we&apos;re very disturbed by the idea of human brains or humanized brains in animals. Much more disturbed by the humanized brain mice than we are by the humanized immune system mice, for example. The other is balls. We tend to be very nervous when we think about the idea, and this is kind of crazy and out there, imagine you could create an animal that had the ability to reproduce &#x2014; its gonads, it&apos;s reproductive system, was human. So that you&apos;d have animals mating and producing human beings and animals. That&apos;s the kind of thing that I think disturbs a lot of people as an idea. And the last is faces. The idea of having animals with human faces, for example, I think just disturbs a lot of people, even though you might say a face is a face. But it&apos;s a marker of human beings and the way we relate to each other and I think there&apos;s just a strong sociological push back against that.</p>

<li>The Einstein field equations appear very simple, but they encode a tremendous amount of complexity.</li>
<li>What looks like one compact equation is actually 16 complicated ones, relating the curvature of spacetime to the matter and energy in the universe.</li>
<li>It showcases how gravity is fundamentally different from all the other forces, and yet in many ways, it is the only one we can wrap our heads around.</li>
</ul>

<p> Although Einstein is a legendary figure in science for a large number of reasons &#x2014; E = mc&#xB2;, the photoelectric effect, and the notion that the speed of light is a constant for everyone &#x2014; his most enduring discovery is also the least understood: his theory of gravitation, general relativity. Before Einstein, we thought of gravitation in Newtonian terms: that everything in the universe that has a mass instantaneously attracts every other mass, dependent on the value of their masses, the gravitational constant, and the square of the distance between them. But Einstein&#x2019;s conception was entirely different, based on the idea that space and time were unified into a fabric, spacetime, and that the curvature of spacetime told not only matter but also energy how to move within it. </p>
<p> This fundamental idea &#x2014; that matter and energy tells spacetime how to curve, and that curved spacetime, in turn, tells matter and energy how to move &#x2014; represented a revolutionary new view of the universe. Put forth in 1915 by Einstein and validated four years later during a total solar eclipse &#x2014; when the bending of starlight coming from light sources behind the sun agreed with Einstein&#x2019;s predictions and not Newton&#x2019;s &#x2014; general relativity has passed every observational and experimental test we have ever concocted. Yet despite its success over more than 100 years, almost no one understands what the one equation that governs general relativity is actually about. Here, in plain English, is what it truly means. </p>

</div><figcaption>Einstein&#x2019;s original equation relates spacetime curvature to the stress-energy of a system (top).

<p> This equation looks pretty simple, in that there are only a few symbols present. But it&#x2019;s quite complex. </p>

<div placeholder="Start writing..." class="redactor-editor" dir="ltr">
<ul>
<li>The first one, G<sub>&#x3BC;&#x3BD;</sub>, is known as the Einstein tensor and represents the curvature of space.</li>
<li>The second one, &#x39B;, is the cosmological constant: an amount of energy, positive or negative, that is inherent to the fabric of space itself.</li>
<li>The third term, g<sub>&#x3BC;&#x3BD;</sub>, is known as the metric, which mathematically encodes the properties of every point within spacetime.</li>
<li>The fourth term, 8&#x3C0;G/c<sup>4</sup>, is just a product of constants and is known as Einstein&#x2019;s gravitational constant, the counterpart of Newton&#x2019;s gravitational constant (G) that most of us are more familiar with.</li>
<li>The fifth term, T<sub>&#x3BC;&#x3BD;</sub>, is known as the stress-energy tensor, and it describes the local (in the nearby vicinity) energy, momentum, and stress within that spacetime.</li>
</ul>
<p> These five terms, all related to one another through what we call the Einstein field equations, are enough to relate the geometry of spacetime to all the matter and energy within it: the hallmark of general relativity. </p>

<p> You might be wondering what is with all those subscripts &#x2014; those weird &#x201C;&#x3BC;&#x3BD;&#x201D; combinations of Greek letters you see at the bottom of the Einstein tensor, the metric, and the stress-energy tensor. Most often, when we write down an equation, we are writing down a scalar equation, that is, an equation that only represents a single equality, where the sum of everything on the left-hand side equals everything on the right. But we can also write down systems of equations and represent them with a single simple formulation that encodes these relationships. <br><br></p>
<p> E = mc&#xB2; is a scalar equation because energy (E), mass (m), and the speed of light (c) all have only single, unique values. But Newton&#x2019;s <strong>F</strong> = m<strong>a</strong> is not a single equation but rather three separate equations: F<sub>x</sub> = ma<sub>x</sub> for the &#x201C;x&#x201D; direction, F<sub>y</sub> = ma<sub>y</sub> for the &#x201C;y&#x201D; direction, and F<sub>z</sub> = ma<sub>z</sub> for the &#x201C;z&#x201D; direction. In general relativity, the fact that we have four dimensions (three space and one time) as well as two subscripts, which physicists know as indices, means that there is not one equation, nor even three or four. Instead, we have each of the four dimensions (t, x, y, z) affecting each of the other four (t, x, y, z), for a total of 4 &#xD7; 4, or 16, equations. </p>

</div><figcaption>Instead of an empty, blank, three-dimensional grid, putting a mass down causes what would have been &#x201C;straight&#x201D; lines to instead become curved by a specific amount. In general relativity, space and time are continuous, with all forms of energy contributing to spacetime&#x2019;s curvature. </figcaption><figcaption>Credit: Christopher Vitale of Networkologies and The Pratt Institute</figcaption><p></p>
<p> Why would we need so many equations just to describe gravitation, whereas Newton only needed one?<br><br></p>
<p> Because geometry is a complicated beast, because we are working in four dimensions, and because what happens in one dimension, or even in one location, can propagate outward and affect every location in the universe, if only you allow enough time to pass. Our universe, with three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, means the geometry of our universe can be mathematically treated as a four-dimensional manifold. </p>
<p> In Riemannian geometry, where manifolds are not required to be straight and rigid but can be arbitrarily curved, you can break that curvature up into two parts: parts that distort the volume of an object and parts that distort the shape of an object. The &#x201C;Ricci&#x201D; part is volume distorting, and that plays a role in the Einstein tensor, as the Einstein tensor is made up of the Ricci tensor and the Ricci scalar, with some constants and the metric thrown in. The &#x201C;Weyl&#x201D; part is shape distorting, and, counterintuitively enough, plays no role in the Einstein field equations. </p>
<p> The Einstein field equations are not just one equation, then, but rather a suite of 16 different equations: one for each of the &#x201C;4 &#xD7; 4&#x201D; combinations. As one component or aspect of the universe changes, such as the spatial curvature at any point or in any direction, every other component as well may change in response. This framework, in many ways, takes the concept of a differential equation to the next level. </p>
<p> A differential equation is any equation where you can do the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>you can provide the initial conditions of your system, such as what is present, where, and when it is, and how it is moving,</li>
<li>then you can plug those conditions into your differential equation,</li>
<li>and the equation will tell you how those things evolve in time, moving forward to the next instant,</li>
<li>where you can plug that information back into the differential equation, where it will then tell you what happens subsequently, in the next instant.</li>
</ul>
<p> It is a tremendously powerful framework and is the very reason why Newton needed to invent calculus in order for things like motion and gravitation to become understandable scientific fields. </p>

</div><figcaption>When you put down even a single point mass in spacetime, you curve the fabric of spacetime everywhere as a result. The Einstein field equations allow you to relate spacetime curvature to matter and energy, in principle, for any distribution you choose.</figcaption><figcaption>Credit: JohnsonMartin / Pixabay</figcaption><p></p>
<p> Only, when we begin dealing with general relativity, it is not just one equation or even a series of independent equations that all propagate and evolve in their own dimension. Instead, because what happens in one direction or dimension affects all the others, we have 16 coupled, interdependent equations, and as objects move and accelerate through spacetime, the stress-energy changes and so does the spatial curvature. </p>
<p> However, these &#x201C;16 equations&#x201D; are not entirely unique! First off, the Einstein tensor is symmetric, which means that there is a relationship between every component that couples one direction to another. In particular, if your four coordinates for time and space are (t, x, y, z), then: </p>
<ul>
<li>the &#x201C;tx&#x201D; component will be equivalent to the &#x201C;xt&#x201D; component,</li>
<li>the &#x201C;ty&#x201D; component will be equivalent to the &#x201C;yt&#x201D; component,</li>
<li>the &#x201C;tz&#x201D; component will be equivalent to the &#x201C;zt&#x201D; component,</li>
<li>the &#x201C;yx&#x201D; component will be equivalent to the &#x201C;xy&#x201D; component,</li>
<li>the &#x201C;zx&#x201D; component will be equivalent to the &#x201C;xz&#x201D; component,</li>
<li>and the &#x201C;zy&#x201D; component will be equivalent to the &#x201C;yz&#x201D; component.</li>
</ul>
<p> All of a sudden, there aren&#x2019;t 16 unique equations but only 10. </p>
<p> Additionally, there are four relationships that tie the curvature of these different dimensions together: the Bianchi Identities. Of the 10 unique equations remaining, only six are independent, as these four relationships bring the total number of independent variables down further. The power of this part allows us the freedom to choose whatever coordinate system we like, which is literally the power of relativity: every observer, regardless of their position or motion, sees the same laws of physics, such as the same rules for general relativity. </p>

<p> There are other properties of this set of equations that are tremendously important. In particular, if you take the divergence of the stress-energy tensor, you always, always get zero, not just overall, but for each individual component. That means that you have four symmetries: no divergence in the time dimension or any of the space dimensions, and every time you have a symmetry in physics, you also have a conserved quantity. </p>
<p> In general relativity, those conserved quantities translate into energy (for the time dimension), as well as momentum in the x, y, and z directions (for the spatial dimensions). Just like that, at least locally in your nearby vicinity, both energy and momentum are conserved for individual systems. Even though it is impossible to define things like &#x201C;global energy&#x201D; overall in general relativity, for any local system within general relativity, both energy and momentum remain conserved at all times; it is a requirement of the theory. </p>

</div><figcaption>As masses move through spacetime relative to one another, they cause the emission of gravitational waves: ripples through the fabric of space itself. These ripples are mathematically encoded in the Metric Tensor. </figcaption><figcaption>Credit: ESO / L. Cal&#xE7;ada</figcaption><p></p>
<p> Another property of general relativity that is different from most other physical theories is that general relativity, as a theory, is nonlinear. If you have a solution to your theory, such as &#x201C;what spacetime is like when I put a single, point mass down,&#x201D; you would be tempted to make a statement like, &#x201C;If I put two point masses down, then I can combine the solution for mass #1 and mass #2 and get another solution: the solution for both masses combined.&#x201D;<br><br></p>
<p> That is true, but only if you have a linear theory. Newtonian gravity is a linear theory: the gravitational field is the gravitational field of every object added together and superimposed atop one another. Maxwell&#x2019;s electromagnetism is similar: the electromagnetic field of two charges, two currents, or a charge and a current can all be calculated individually and added together to give the net electromagnetic field. This is even true in quantum mechanics, as the Schr&#xF6;dinger equation is linear (in the wavefunction), too. </p>
<p> But Einstein&#x2019;s equations are nonlinear, which means you cannot do that. If you know the spacetime curvature for a single point mass, and then you put down a second point mass and ask, &#x201C;How is spacetime curved now?&#x201D; we cannot write down an exact solution. In fact, even today, more than 100 years after general relativity was first put forth, there are still only about ~20 exact solutions known in relativity, and a spacetime with two point masses in it still is not one of them. </p>

<p> Originally, Einstein formulated general relativity with only the first and last terms in the equations, that is, with the Einstein tensor on one side and the stress-energy tensor (multiplied by the Einstein gravitational constant) on the other side. He only added in the cosmological constant, at least according to legend, because he could not stomach the consequences of a universe that was compelled to either expand or contract.<br><br></p>
<p> And yet, the cosmological constant itself would have been a revolutionary addition even if nature turned out not to have a non-zero one (in the form of today&#x2019;s dark energy) for a simple but fascinating reason. A cosmological constant, mathematically, is literally the only &#x201C;extra&#x201D; thing you can add into general relativity without fundamentally changing the nature of the relationship between matter and energy and the curvature of spacetime. </p>
<p> The heart of general relativity, however, is not the cosmological constant, which is simply one particular type of &#x201C;energy&#x201D; you can add in but rather the other two more general terms. The Einstein tensor, G<sub>&#x3BC;&#x3BD;</sub>, tells us what the curvature of space is, and it is related to the stress-energy tensor, T<sub>&#x3BC;&#x3BD;</sub>, which tells us how the matter and energy within the universe is distributed. </p>

<p>In our universe, we almost always make approximations. If we ignored 15 out of the 16 Einstein equations and simply kept the &#x201C;energy&#x201D; component, you would recover the theory it superseded: Newton&#x2019;s law of gravitation. If you instead made the universe symmetric in all spatial dimensions and did not allow it to rotate, you get an isotropic and homogeneous universe, one governed by the Friedmann equations (and hence required to expand or contract). On the largest cosmic scales, this actually seems to describe the universe in which we live.<br><br></p>
<p> But you are also allowed to put in any distribution of matter and energy, as well as any collection of fields and particles that you like, and if you can write it down, Einstein&#x2019;s equations will relate the geometry of your spacetime to how the universe itself is curved to the stress-energy tensor, which is the distribution of energy, momentum, and stress. </p>
<p>If there actually is a &#x201C;theory of everything&#x201D; that describes both gravity and the quantum universe, the fundamental differences between these conceptions, including the fundamentally nonlinear nature of Einstein&#x2019;s theory, will need to be addressed. As it stands, given their vastly dissimilar properties, the unification of gravity with the other quantum forces remains one of the most ambitious dreams in all of theoretical physics. </p>

<p>It is tempting, whenever a new discovery comes along, to imagine a whole slew of revolutions that might soon ensue. After all, anytime you can suddenly do or accomplish any task that was previously impractical or even (thought to be) impossible, that is one less obstacle standing in the way of even your loftiest, pie-in-the-sky dreams. However, no matter what discoveries ensue, the fundamental laws of physics that underlie reality must always be obeyed; you might be able to cajole nature into doing a lot of clever things, but you cannot very well break the rules that govern it. If you could, we would have to write down new laws, because the old ones would no longer be valid. Despite all the tricks we have developed, we cannot create fundamental magnetic monopoles, violate the conservation of momentum or energy, or work our way around the second law of thermodynamics.</p>



<p>Yet <a href="https://www.livescience.com/google-invents-time-crystal">a recent article</a>, touting <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13571">a brand new discovery</a> involving time crystals and Google&#x2019;s quantum computer, claims to do just that: evade the second law of thermodynamics. Is that even right? <a href="https://www.patreon.com/startswithabang">Patreon supporter</a> Chad Marler wants to know, asking:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Hi Ethan&#x2026; I was reading some headlines and <a href="https://www.livescience.com/google-invents-time-crystal">came across this article</a>.

<p>I will tell you, up front, that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13571">the scientific</a> paper is legit, but <a href="https://www.livescience.com/google-invents-time-crystal">the recent article</a> is full of misconceptions and misinterpretations.

<h2>What is a time crystal?</h2>



<p>Unlike most things in physics, where theorists imagine a possibility far out of reach of current or near-future technology, time crystals have only been around for a very short time, even in our minds. In 2012, Nobel Laureate Frank Wilczek proposed that a new state of matter might exist: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_crystal">time crystal</a>. Most of us know what a normal crystal is: a repeating, rigid lattice or grid of particles, like atoms or molecules, that compose a solid, ordered structure.</p>



<p>When we talk about time crystals, however, there is no lattice, no grid, and no solid, ordered structure. The important component of a time crystal, at least conceptually, is the &#x201C;repeating&#x201D; part. Whereas a conventional crystal has a structure that repeats in space, meaning it exhibits translational symmetry (if you move within the crystal, the structure looks the same everywhere), a time crystal should repeat its configuration, periodically, in time.</p>

<p>Originally, when time crystals were first considered, they were presumed to be impossible for a number of reasons. There were theorems published that proved their impossibility. There were assertions that a system that transitioned from lower-to-higher energy states would not return to its original state again spontaneously, and then go back-and-forth between those two states, because that would indicate some type of perpetual motion, violating the second law of thermodynamics and the conservation of energy.</p>



<p>But not only did theorists find loopholes in those theorems, but more impressively, experimentalists just went right ahead and created them in the lab. In 2016, Norman Yao and his team came up with a scheme to create a time crystal through a very clever plan. Instead of taking a closed, constant system, he proposed leveraging a system with out-of-equilibrium conditions. He would then &#x201C;drive&#x201D; that system externally, making it an open (rather than a closed) system and achieving the much sought after &#x201C;time crystal&#x201D; state.</p>

<p>It is a little bit complicated, but you can imagine that you have a bunch of atoms that have a spin, and those spins have directions: dipole moments. The way you can &#x201C;drive&#x201D; the system is by subjecting the system to spin-echo pulses that contain imperfections, but which occur periodically while allowing interactions to randomly occur in the intermediate times. If you get the combinations of these dipole moments of the spins and the spin-echo pulses to behave in a certain fashion, you could get a time crystal.</p>



<p>The hard part, though, is avoiding what normally happens when you interact with a system: If there is an exchange of energy, that energy gets transferred throughout the system, internally, causing runaway heating due to many-body interactions. Somehow, you have to:</p>



<ul><li>drive the system, externally, with a spin-flip pulse,</li><li>so that you get a periodic response,</li><li>that is proportional to the time at which you pulse the system,</li><li>and at some multiple of the period, you return to your initial state,</li><li>while the &#x201C;time crystal&#x201D; only oscillates away from and then back into that initial state.</li></ul>



<p>Only if you go back, periodically, to exactly your initial state, with no extra heating and achieve a pure steady-state can you make a time crystal.</p>

<h2>How can you make one in real life?</h2>



<p>Yao&#x2019;s work <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02589v2">first appeared in August 2016</a>, and within mere months, two independent groups put it to the test:</p>



<ul><li><a href="https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/lukin">Mikhail Lukin</a>&#x2018;s at Harvard University, and</li><li><a href="http://iontrap.umd.edu/">Christopher Monroe</a>&#x2018;s at University of Maryland.</li></ul>



<p>They tried to set up a system precisely as Yao had demanded but, because the conditions are so general, wound up taking vastly different approaches. </p>



<p>Monroe&#x2019;s group took a series of yttrium atoms all lined up, in a one-dimensional line, all coupled together via their electrostatic interactions. When they subjected this atomic line to a series of spin-flip pulses, they found that the system would return to its initial state every two full pulse periods. Meanwhile, Lukin&#x2019;s group took an actual diamond crystal that contained somewhere on the order of ~1,000,000 spin-impurities within it and pulsed those impurities within the crystal with microwave radiation. That radiation flipped their spins, but time crystal oscillations were only observed every three full pulse periods &#x2014; whereupon the crystal would return to its initial quantum state.</p>

<p>This occurred for both groups, interestingly enough, even when the driving pulses were imperfect. You could:</p>



<ul><li>alter the magnitude of the pulse, making it stronger or weaker,</li><li>vary the frequency of pulsation, making it a little quicker or slower,</li><li>turn up or turn down the amount of noise and/or interactions that occurred between the pulses,</li><li>or change the conditions of the environment that the system is placed in,</li></ul>



<p>and still recover this time crystal behavior. Surprisingly, for these non-equilibrium systems, there is a lot of wiggle-room as far as what you can do and still observe this time crystal behavior.</p>



<p>But as they were originally envisioned by Wilczek in 2012, an idealized time crystal would occur in a system that was in thermal equilibrium &#x2014; that was neither absorbing nor emitting energy from or to the surrounding environment. In order to create a time crystal, you needed to have an open system that could exchange energy with its external surroundings, and that system needed to be driven at a periodic frequency. Moreover, the imperfections in the driving could not be too large, or the crystal would &#x201C;melt&#x201D; in precisely the fashion we want to avoid: with runaway heating occurring from many-body interactions.</p>

<h2>What did the Google team, using a quantum computer, actually do?</h2>



<p>Back when these time crystals were first realized in 2016/2017, it was recognized that time crystals could conceivably be applied to quantum computers. Instead of encoding a bit, like the &#x201C;0&#x201D; or &#x201C;1&#x201D; a standard computer encodes, a quantum computer encodes a qubit, which is a probability-weighted superposition of both &#x201C;0&#x201D; and &#x201C;1&#x201D; simultaneously. Although you can only measure a &#x201C;0&#x201D; or &#x201C;1&#x201D; at the end, the fact that you have many qubits allows you to see whether you have preserved the quantum behavior of the system (or not), whether your results are error-free (or not), and what type of final-state distribution you get and whether it matches your theoretical predictions.</p>



<p>The hard &#x201C;problem&#x201D; with a quantum computer is the problem of decoherence: Over relatively short timescales, the system interacts with the surrounding particles, and this causes you to lose the quantum behavior you are trying to preserve. For Google&#x2019;s quantum computer, which is based on superconducting qubits (as opposed to quantum dots or ion traps, for example), you get a coherence timescale of about 50 microseconds. You can only perform perhaps a few dozen computations before decoherence ruins your experiment, and you lose the quantum behavior you sought to maintain and measure. (Or, more precisely, before too many errors, including errors from simple crosstalk between qubits, simply transform your signal into noise.)</p>

In equilibrium (a), only the lowest energy states are ordered, with higher-energy ones being unordered. In most driven systems (b), no states are ordered. But in systems with many-body localization (c), all states can be ordered, allowing for the possibility of returning periodically to your original state.

<p>Instead of using a dynamical phase like the spins of atoms, though, a quantum computer allows you to use a different property: the order of eigenstates in many-body systems. If you brought your qubits into an equilibrium setting, you would see that there was order in the lowest energy states and unordered states at higher energies. That is why, under normal circumstances, if you allow too much energy to propagate through your system, you just wind up with featureless, unordered systems; it is like the heat or energy just randomized everything.</p>



<p>However, some systems can exhibit what is called MBL: many-body localization, where you get local conservation laws and only a discrete number of ordered states. When you drive the system, which the Google team did with pulsed microwaves that cause the qubits to flip, your qubits have the potential to behave just like the dynamical phases did when we were measuring atomic spins: If the qubits do not absorb heat or impart energy to their surroundings, they can simply flip between different ordered states. With enough pulses, you can conceivably recover your original state.</p>



<p>Sure enough, every two full periods of the microwave pulses resulted in a recovery of the original state: a time crystal. Not bound by these decoherence effects any longer, the researchers could maintain this time crystal state for up to ~100 seconds, a remarkable achievement.</p>

<h2>And how do the claims <a href="https://www.livescience.com/google-invents-time-crystal">in the LiveScience article</a> hold up?</h2>



<p>Although the article does a fine job of describing the experiments performed themselves, there is a howler of a statement made early on:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>With the ability to forever cycle between two states without ever losing energy, time crystals dodge one of the most important laws of physics &#x2014; the&#xA0;second law of thermodynamics, which states that the disorder, or entropy, of an isolated system must always increase. These bizarre time crystals remain stable, resisting any dissolution into randomness, despite existing in a constant state of flux.</p></blockquote>



<p>There is no dodge; the second law of thermodynamics applies to closed systems, not open ones. The disorder of the system, if you include the microwave pulses and the external environment, does in fact go up, just as predicted. The crystals oscillate between allowable states and return to their original ones when driven properly, just as their non-qubit analogues did years prior. In order to do this, the researchers needed to discriminate between external decoherence and internal thermalization, both of which can destroy the quantum state they are seeking to maintain, which itself is an admirable achievement.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1200" height="799" src="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg" alt class="wp-image-140717" srcset="https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg 1200w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg?resize=20,12 20w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg?resize=375,250 375w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg?resize=640,426 640w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg?resize=768,511 768w, https://bigthink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/pan_street_food_cooking_food_frying-1261490.jpg?resize=1024,682 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"><figcaption>When a series of food items are placed in a pan and the chef jiggles it in a way to coax the items into flipping, some will flip 180&#xB0;, others 360&#xB0;, others 540&#xB0;, etc. But if the chef jiggles it enough times, all the items may return to their original state, rather than taking on random configurations. This is the concept of a time crystal. (Credit: Public domain / Creative Commons CC0.)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although it may be fun to claim, as the headline of the article did, that this is &#x201C;otherworldly&#x201D; and &#x201C;could change physics forever,&#x201D; it is more like imagining you have got a skillet with different sized and shaped mollusks in it and a chef who jiggles the pan in a way that makes the shelled creatures flip. Some will flip 180&#xB0;, others 360&#xB0;, others 540&#xB0;, etc. In the quantum world, some of these mollusks can take on in-between values, too. But after a certain number of jiggles, the mollusks all wind up the same way they started, regardless of what that specific initial configuration was. That is all the Google team is doing, but instead of mollusks or spinning atoms, they are using the eigenstates of a quantum computer.</p>



<p>Which, if we are being honest, is still a remarkable achievement! This is a new kind of time crystal, a new way of achieving it, and one with the potential to study non-equilibrium phases of matter on a quantum computer. And although you have to pump energy into the system in pulses, the time crystal can, in fact, return to whatever specific state it began with, even with small imperfections occurring in the &#x201C;flips,&#x201D; without destroying, decohering, or losing the nature of the quantum state due to thermal instabilities. No laws are violated and the physics we know is not changed in any way, but this is a phenomenal achievement nonetheless. In a mere nine years, we have gone from theorizing the existence of time crystals to creating them to observing them on a quantum processor. When a new field yields significant advances so quickly, it compels us to pay attention.</p>

<p>Every morning you emerge from sleep, open your eyes, and find that&#x2026; yup&#x2026; you are still here.&#xA0;Another day on the planet &#x2014; breathing, eating, and working so you can keep breathing, eating and working. Basically, you are trying to hold it all together while having a little fun. Then, after about 16 hours, you will drop back into bed with one day less left in your life-inventory, knowing you have to repeat the whole effort again tomorrow.&#xA0;This is the reality, in one form or another, for you, me, and every other human being on the planet. It has also been the reality, in one form or another, for every human being since we emerged as a separate species some 300,000 years ago. All and all, it seems pretty weird. What is it all about? What is it all for?&#xA0;Is there a mystery of life?</p>



<h2 id="h-the-mystery-of-life">The mystery of life</h2>



<p>Today I would like to take on these questions through the lens of another question. Can science answer this basic weirdness, or is there a fundamental mystery of life? </p>



<p>Once I did a public debate with a guy who was into transhumanism (which essentially holds that one day we will merge with computers). He was adamant that ultimately science would explain all facets of the world. In the end, nothing would remain hidden before its all-illuminating gaze. Even though I have spent my life living &#x2014; and loving &#x2014; science, I felt something really essential was missing from his perspective. To me, his omission is an understanding of what <em>explanations</em> are for and the limits of what they can do.</p>



<p>If the question is, &#x201C;Can science explain life?&#x201D; then the answer I think someday will be &#x201C;mostly yes,&#x201D; if what we are aiming for are the processes at work in life. Science has already successfully deployed the technique of reduction to see the building blocks of life. <a href="https://bigthink.com/thinking/reductionism-vs-emergence-science-philosophy/">Reduction</a> means looking for explanations or successful predictive descriptions of a system by focusing on its smaller-scale constitutive elements. If you are interested in a human body, then reductions lead down from organs to cells to DNA to genes to biomolecules and so on. That approach has obviously been spectacularly successful.</p>



<section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="bt-pullquote">
                                            <section>
                                                <h2>Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.</h2>
                                                <h3>S&#xF8;ren Kierkegaard</h3>
                                            </section>
                                        </section>



<p>It has not, however, been enough. The frontier now seems to be understanding life as a complex adaptive system, meaning one in which organization and cause occur on many levels. It is not just the atomic building blocks that matter; influences propagate up and down the scale, with multiple connected networks from genes to the environment and back. As I have written before, <a href="https://bigthink.com/hard-science/information-central-physics-universe/">information</a> may play an essential role here in ways that do not occur in non-living systems.</p>



<p>But the deeper question remains: will this ongoing process of explanatory refinement exhaust the weirdness of being alive or the mystery of life that I described in the opening? I think not.</p>



<h2>Explanation vs. experience</h2>



<p>The reason I take that position is because there is a profound and (literally) existential difference between an explanation and experience. We humans invented the marvelous process called science to understand the patterns we experience around us. We did this because we are curious creatures by nature and because we also hope to gain some control over the world around us. But here is the key point: <em>experience is always more than the explanation</em>. (That is the takeaway from a philosophical thought experiment called <a href="https://bigthink.com/thinking/inside-marys-room-physical-world/">Mary&#x2019;s Room</a>.) The direct, unmediated totality of experience can never be corralled by an explanation.&#xA0;Why? Because experience is the source of explanations.</p>



<p>&#x201C;Experience&#x201D; can be a difficult locus for discussion. It is so close and so obvious that, for some people, it does not seem like anything at all. But for many across the whole of existence, it has been a central concern. For the philosophies of classical India and Asia, it was always the starting point. For philosophers in the West, it made its most recent reappearance as a topic in the works of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/">William James</a> and &#x201C;phenomenologists&#x201D; like <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/husserl/">Edmund Husserl</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/merleau-ponty/">Maurice Merleau-Ponty</a>. For all of these thinkers and writers, experience was not something that could be taken for granted &#x2014; it was the ground from which all other questions became possible.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Sometimes it has been called &#x201C;presence.&#x201D; Sometimes it has been called &#x201C;self-luminosity.&#x201D; Stephen Hawking even acknowledges it when he asked, &#x201C;What puts the fire into the equations?&#x201D; That fire <em>is</em> experience. It is the verb &#x201C;to be,&#x201D; and the only way into being is through experience.</p>



<p>The key point here is that direct, lived experience is not amenable to explanation. I can theorize about perception and cognition. I can do experiments to test those theories. But even if I gave you an account of what every nerve cell in your brain at every nanosecond was doing, it would still not be experience. It would be nothing more than a list of words and numbers. Your actual and direct experience of the world &#x2014; of the tart taste of an apple or of looking into the eyes of someone you love &#x2014; would always overflow the list. There would always be <em>more</em>.&#xA0;</p>



<p>That is because explanations always take some particular aspect of lived experience and separate it out. Explanation is like the foreground. But experience is beyond foreground and background. It is an inseparable holism, a totality that does not atomize. It is not something you think in your head; it is what you live as a body embedded in surroundings. That is how every moment of our strange, beautiful, sad, tragic, and fully amazing lives is revealed moment by moment. Explanations may help in specific circumstances, but they can never exhaust that ongoing revelation that is the mystery of life.</p>



<h2>The mystery of life is not a problem to be solved</h2>



<p>Let&#x2019;s turn once again to our question: is life a mystery? It is good to remember S&#xF8;ren Kierkegaard&#x2019;s famous admonition: &#x201C;Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced.&#x201D; This perspective does not diminish science in any way. That is because our experience of science <em>itself</em> heightens our appreciation of the world, like the rush you feel when you understand why the sky appears blue or blood appears red.</p>



<p>So yes, life is a mystery, but that does not mean we are left in ignorance. Like a skier effortlessly driving down a steep slope, or a pianist bringing us a beautiful sonata, we can know this mystery but not with words, equations, and explanations but by living it thoroughly with body and heart and mind.</p>
