      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>The Drum quizzes David Temkin, Google’s director of product management for ads privacy and user trust, about all things privacy.</strong></p><p>Google, the tech giant whose decision to <a href="/news/2021/06/24/google-postpones-the-death-the-cookie-until-2023">phase out third-party cookies in 2023</a> has brought the ad industry’s reckoning over consumer data to a head, has also been among the most influential forces in shaping the future of cookieless advertising. Early last year the company introduced Privacy Sandbox, its proposed framework for privacy-centric advertising sans third-party cookies.</p><p>The various components of the proposed solution – many of which remain in various stages of testing – have been met with mixed responses. While some hold that Google’s Privacy Sandbox offers genuinely privacy-safe alternatives for targeted advertising and ad measurement, critics have argued that it doesn’t go far enough in protecting user privacy.</p><p>Here, we catch up with David Temkin, Google’s director of product management, ads privacy and trust, who shares his perspective.</p><p><strong>What does user privacy look like to you?</strong></p><p>Let’s talk about what we mean by ‘privacy,’ because there is no hard and fast definition on the regulatory basis, on a man-in-the-street basis or on a tech company basis. But there are a few things that people do agree on. For example, it’s a generally-accepted practice – for a lot of good reasons – that if you were to go to, say, cnn.com, and you click on a link, and you click on another link, and you’re viewing articles related to health, that CNN would be expected to collect those clicks, and hold them and do something with them, and maybe present you with personalized content based on them. And the reason that that is considered to be OK is that it’s perfectly obvious to the user they’re interacting with. It’s intuitive that you know that when you’re looking at cnn.com or the CNN app, they’re receiving your information. It’s just perfectly clear.</p><p>[It becomes an issue] when that app is being [opaque with] the user, especially [in sharing that information with] third parties that the user can’t see. Most adtech might have a presence on the webpage for various reasons, and they are siphoning out data from that browser or that app, collecting it on the back end in a way that a user can’t see. And that gets to the core of what we’re talking about ... There is a general consensus [that is] strong with users and well established across the industry ... that tracking is undesirable. It makes users uncomfortable. We do not want to see a further degradation in trust for ads. In addressing the question of, ‘What do people mean by ‘privacy’?’ The core element is tracking.</p><p>Now, there are other aspects to privacy. I would argue that privacy is kind of subjective – it’s what the user feels. Do they feel that they understand where their data is going and what it’s being used for? [Do they know] if or how it’s being shared? Why did I get this ad? Who delivered it to me? So, there’s a little bit of ... ’give me more transparency.’ And then there’s the flip side of it: control. Do I want my ads personalized? Or if I do, what topics? Do I want to see what categories might be sensitive [and block those]? [It comes] down to the user: does the user have a sense that their data is being used fairly? Do they understand who’s using it and for what purposes? So, tracking a key component of it, but I think it’s broader. It’s more of a subjective feeling on the part of the users. And there are a lot of angles that can be used to improve the sense of privacy beyond material data privacy.</p><p>The definition of privacy is an important question. And that plays a major role in how Chrome and we collectively are approaching the Privacy Sandbox and private advertising in general. It’s not that the Privacy Sandbox will make it completely and totally impossible to track a user. But it provides mechanisms for advertisers to achieve the same results without tracking users. And at Google Ads – as distinct from Chrome – when third-party cookies are removed, we will not be tracking users as they browse across the web. We also will not be working around ... the removal of third-party cookies to create some other thing. We see [cookie workarounds] as a central element that needs to be tamped down on in order to kind of lift up user trust in advertising and in the digital ecosystem in general. </p><p><strong>So, how is Google thinking about balancing this kind of privacy with the demands of advertisers?</strong></p><p>When we look forward to the privacy-transformed internet, we see the need for [an ecosystem that] works for marketers, for publishers and also for users. And so when you look at the advertiser versus user piece, the main source of tension is there on data. Users are uncomfortable with how their is data being used. It’s not really on the level of, ‘Am I receiving ads and are they useful to me?’ Relevant ads are of service to the user. The reason that [a relevant ad] is more valuable than an ad that isn’t relevant is that it [has been proven] more relevant to the user – they clicked on it.</p><p>We’re looking to make advertising both private for users and effective from a monetization and marketing standpoint. We don’t see [it as] two worlds that shall never coexist – we think that we have the right recipe to bring them together. And hopefully we can lead the industry into that endpoint.</p><p>Privacy Sandbox is a technology that Chrome is working on with the rest of the web community, [including] World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the adtech community, to create a new standard that allows for the core adtech use cases to be realized without violating user privacy. ‘User privacy’ in this situation is defined as, ‘We don’t want to be tracked across websites; we don’t want to share personal information unwittingly.’ So the core advertising use cases that are addressed by this are a set of cases that relate to targeting interest-based advertising, remarketing, measurement and, finally, fraud. Those are the core ad use cases. There are a lot of details under the hood of each one of those, [but this is] the center of what makes adtech useful and what makes ads relevant and economically viable. There will be some set of long tail use cases that cannot be accomplished using this technology, but the intention here is to transition the business as it is currently structured, while being privacy-respecting, into this new world.</p><p>But Google Ads has a sort of a portfolio approach to privacy. There are other things that we’re doing within Google Ads to support publishers and effective advertising. [For example,] better harnessing of first-party data is critical to what we’re doing. We think that’s underleveraged right now, and we’re introducing a set of new offerings that will permit publishers to interact with advertisers that they have direct relationships with to add value to their own sites. That’s an example. There will be more [product development] coming down the line.</p><p><strong>You expressed that you’re confident that tools within Privacy Sandbox will prove as effective, if not more effective, than current tracking-based methods for advertisers. What do you mean by that? Can you share any performance data?</strong></p><p>I don’t have any data of that form, but I will say it’s still early stages. Chrome delayed the elimination of third-party cookies until the end of 2023, and the intention behind that was to allow for more iteration and more feedback.</p><p>If you look at how Chrome works, it is part of the web community. Its development is done as part of an open-source collaborative process [with other companies]. It’s all driven toward, ‘Can we create standards that make this work?’ Like, the reason that you can go to a certain web page in Chrome, Firefox and Safari and see the same thing is that they’re built on the same standards. And the reason that works is that on the web, development ... is kind of like writing software in a fishbowl. There’s a ton of feedback and iteration that goes through that.</p><p>And when you look at something like Google’s Federated Learning of Cohorts (FLoC), FLoC is not a product – it was a proposal. And a lot of feedback has come in. Not everyone’s happy with it. But that’s how [the process of development is] supposed to work. And it may not be the case that everyone’s going to be satisfied in the end – but that’s partially because there is no clear definition of privacy. But we have a certain conception of [privacy] that we believe is mainstream, and it’s conforming with what users believe and what most of the industry believes. And we do believe that, in the time allotted ... the technology available to the industry can deliver the kind of results that we’re talking about: preserving the mainstream advertising use cases, while making them private, and preserving the effectiveness of them. Again, you should expect some iteration here. FLoC is a proposal – it will evolve. There will be other birds. There are already a lot of birds.</p><p><strong>There are a lot of factors shaping the future of the web right now. The metaverse is one of those things. What does privacy look like within the metaverse? And will other movements, such as crypto and NFTs, impact advertising and your vision for a more private digital ecosystem?</strong></p><p>Zooming out a bit, Google wants to support an open, thriving internet. And we believe that advertising has a critical role to play in supporting such an entity. I don’t think any of these things – such as the metaverse or crypto – are going to remove the role that advertising will play in this open internet. Now, should users choose to immerse themselves in a virtual reality and that becomes the nature of the internet, modes of interaction may change. They did when we shifted to mobile.</p><p>Could crypto play a role in this? It’s possible. Will crypto eliminate advertising? Absolutely not. Crypto and advertising could be combined in various ways, as the metaverse could be combined [with advertising]. It’s hard to see how this plays out, but you’ve got one invariant here: an open internet depends on the ability of publishers and app developers to monetize their sites in ways that don’t require user payment. And it’s not really specific to the mode of interaction. So we’ve already seen one big shift in the internet to mobile apps. Could others occur? They could. I’m probably not the guy to ask about that. But I can tell you that no matter how it lands, you will see advertising play a role.</p><p><strong>In the background of this digital evolution, there’s a lot happening on the regulatory side of things. China and Saudi Arabia are the latest to pass comprehensive, GDPR-like laws, but countless countries and US states are in the process of proposing and passing their own consent-based consumer data privacy laws. How will these changes impact what Google is doing? </strong></p><p>A lot of these are playing out over time. Some of these are new regulations and some of them are changing interpretations of existing regulations. So for example, there are regulations involving kids in ads or that at least affect kids in ads. One example is the UK’s Age-Appropriate Design Code. There are successor regulations that will apply in a broader geographical context and there are discussions of doing the same in the US. Another regulation that has existed for some time is EU’s Data Protection Directive, which is one of the factors [that led to] a website ... telling you to accept cookies. That, too, is an ever-evolving set of interpretations, and an ever-evolving set of legal frameworks. We’re tracking all of that.</p><p>[In general,] I think anything that drives forward a user-favorable way of interacting with the web is something that we’re on board with. We of course are also interested in preserving effective advertising. One thing to think about with these is: are the results of these regulations protective of users? Do they add friction to the user? We hope that ... we can ultimately get to a place where the internet works a little bit like the way it used to: click on a website, go to another website, click on another website, go to another website. Right now, it’s a little different from that with all the consents and the opt-ins, but opt-in as a philosophy for gaining trust from the user – and not just opt-in, but opt-in that users understand – we see as important.</p><p>Beyond the lawmaking component, enforcement agencies are cracking down on anti-competitive business models and data practices that might be illegal. Earlier this year, the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) even launched an investigation into Google’s Privacy Sandbox browser changes. How is Google approaching that situation?</p><p>In terms of the CMA ... it’s not just that there’s a regulation and we need to comply and we can provide input on it. There’s a general concern about the Privacy Sandbox and CMA wants to make sure that everyone’s on a level playing field and that we’re not advantaging Google Ads and that there’s not some kind of unfair linkage between Google Ads and Chrome. We operate fairly separately – I want to emphasize that.</p><p>The important thing here is that we’re actually working with the CMA collaboratively. They will be participating in the assessment of the Sandbox as it goes forward. For example, they’re going to take a look at what we are doing with testing. What are the results of testing? What tests are we [using] to determine advertising effectiveness of the Privacy Sandbox? That’s part of it. And they’re also asking [us to clarify] our use of data. We made a set of announcements earlier this year. Effectively, the CMA commitments encode those – we’re very comfortable with those ... They’re part of our commitment to not track users fundamentally and to separate what goes on at Google from the rest of the web. So you’re looking at a model there where there’s a certain amount of collaboration and consultation. Other parties can weigh in. And this is sort of novel. And hopefully it helps. </p><p>Our interests are aligned [with CMA] in that we want the entire web and all of adtech to be on a level playing field here ... Privacy Sandbox – and its design, its intentions – needs to be something that supports the web as it is, not just the big players. What makes the web so valuable is that there are millions and millions of websites. And our incentives, I think alone among big tech, are aligned with a thriving and open web. </p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Burger and root beer purveyor A&amp;W Restaurants has kicked off a playful new ad campaign that pokes fun at big fast food’s recent obsession with celebrity endorsements.</strong></p><p>Fast food chains have in recent months seemed more influencer-invested and star-seized than ever before. The strategy du jour has captivated seemingly every big fast food player – <a href="/news/2021/06/30/how-mcdonald-s-chipotle-learned-let-culture-consumers-drive-the-work">McDonald’s created the Travis Scott meal</a> last year (only to cut ties with the rapper amid fallout from the Astroworld concert that left 10 dead) and is counting down to Christmas with <a href="/news/2021/11/11/mcdonald-s-counts-down-12-days-christmas-with-mariah-carey-s-mariah-menu">its new ‘Mariah Menu.’</a> Meanwhile, Popeyes in October teamed with Megan Thee Stallion to launch the new Hottie Sauce, while Burger King recently rolled out a line of celebrity-inspired meals with Nelly, Chase Hudson and Larissa Machado. It’s part of a phenomenon The Drum’s US editor Kenneth Hein <a href="/insight/2021/10/19/snoop-dogg-syndrome-walking-the-walk-debating-floc-making-sense-us-market-trends">has dubbed ‘Snoop Dogg syndrome.’</a></p><p>And A&amp;W thinks it’s overplayed. That’s why the American burger and root beer chain has debuted the new ‘Anti-Celeb Meals’ campaign, which pokes fun at competitors by juxtaposing their celebrity-studded creative against images of A&amp;W employees reenacting the poses.</p><h2><strong>A spotlight on real employees</strong></h2><p>Developed in conjunction with Kentucky-based creative agency Coomer, the creative spotlights four A&amp;W ‘celebs’ – everyday store employees – based in Central Kentucky locations: Raider, Hannah, Gerald and Jada. The employees are pictured enjoying their own signature meals, stylized to look like competitors’ star-studded ads. </p><p>One of the fast food chain’s largest ad campaigns in recent years, the creative will run across social and digital channels. It will also appear in-store, and individual A&amp;W locations will be outfitted with various assets to fit their unique needs. </p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39441 --><p>“Our A&amp;W team members are incredibly dedicated and hardworking – particularly those who have been with us for a long time and have a lot of experience running our restaurants,” says Liz Bazner, the company’s senior director of marketing. “Giving them the celebrity treatment and recognizing the talents they bring to the workplace every day was not only really fun, but also rewarding.”</p><h2><strong>Attracting and retaining talent amid the ‘Great Resignation’</strong></h2><p>The initiative aims to not only boost brand awareness, but also attract and retain talent by shining a light on the people who keep A&amp;W running. The concept was ideated by the chain’s field marketing team, which usually focuses on developing menu-related campaigns. However, after witnessing the challenges that stores were facing in recruiting and retaining talent on the ground, the team issued a request for a ‘Comprehensive Hiring Package for Franchisees’ to be made available across A&amp;W’s 625 locations.</p><p>In response, the company received a proposal by Coomer to flip the script on the popular celebrity meal trend – and highlight real employees in order to help attract and retain talent. The new campaign includes not only multichannel marketing efforts, but also a hiring package created for A&amp;W franchisees that includes special-edition customizable social, digital, in-store and outdoor assets. Some of these assets include 3D employee meal box signs and new uniforms for staff members – all designed to be customized to a given store location and its team. </p><p>A&amp;W isn’t the only restaurant struggling to attract and retain employees. Amid what’s being termed the ‘Great Resignation,’ restaurants everywhere are facing hardship; research by the National Restaurant Association in July found that 75% of restaurant operators said that recruitment and employee retention were their top challenges, compared with just 8% who said so in January. </p><h2><strong>A new approach to a new need</strong></h2><p>Switching gears from product- and limited-time offer-focused marketing was no easy task, according to Bazner. “[I]t was challenging to shift gears to hiring and retention, but we knew it was crucial to get the ‘now hiring’ tools in the hands of our owners as quickly as possible to support their needs. [The campaign is] incredibly authentic and also allowed us to pull this concept together incredibly quickly using our own restaurants, products and people.”</p><p>The boots-on-the-ground feel of the campaign adds to the fast food company’s ongoing efforts to convey authenticity in its marketing; A&amp;W uses real products in its food photography and prioritizes sharing user-generated content on social media. Tapping real A&amp;W store employees for this campaign seemed like a natural fit within this narrative, Bazner says. </p><p>And she’s optimistic that the efforts will pay off. “[This campaign] is a pretty unique way to get people nationwide talking about the fact that our restaurants are hiring,” she says. “It’s still early days – these customizable marketing materials were just made available to our franchise system this week – but we’re going to keep a close eye on the number of restaurants that are ordering these kits to use at their own locations. We’re ... hoping that [franchise owners] see an uptick in applicants immediately.”</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39442 --><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>For heritage brands undergoing a transformation, the key to realizing a new future may be found in leveraging the past, writes Oxford University Press’s head of brand and digital communications Tamira Hamam.</strong></p><p>To the relief, and great fortune, of marketers and brand strategists everywhere, brand building is no longer an art form confined to the big budgets and commercial finesse of fast-moving consumer goods staples like Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble. More and more, we see longstanding, established brands in transformation looking to the very core of their business – their brand purpose and positioning – to reinvigorate their people, customers and portfolio. In the past year alone, heritage brand giants such as Cadbury, Boots and BMW have all invested in new logo designs, repositioned messaging and a reimagining of their purpose and vision statements.</p><p>It’s a smart move. Anyone who has ever written a positioning statement or strapline will know the clarity that comes with unifying around a common thought. However, for many chief execs and their C-suites, the idea of investing in an already recognizable brand – let alone conducting a costly brand refresh exercise – is low on the agenda. Rebrands are risky, and an empty logo change can cost millions — just ask Mastercard about its short-lived 2006 rebrand, which cost $1.5m and was reversed by Pentagram in 2016.</p><p>Very often, businesses focus on the mechanics of transformation – structural, cultural and strategic – without thinking about the halo effect of something as visible and scalable as brand to support and lead change. But the benefits for those who marry these modes of thinking are often tangible and immediate – nothing communicates a renewed vision more clearly than a change of brand.</p><p>After recently leading a 500-year old publishing house through this kind of step change, here are some learnings for those looking to harness the power of an established brand in order to find a place in the ‘new world’:</p><h2><strong>1. Set (and communicate) the rules of the game early</strong></h2><p>When it comes to rebranding, the size of the task at hand tends to be  proportionate to the level of ambition set by your business strategy. Are you diversifying your portfolio, trying to reach new customers or enter new markets? Are you hoping to challenge existing preconceptions about your brand?</p><p>If so, a fine-tuning of your visual and verbal assets isn’t going to cut it. Seismic change doesn’t come for free, and legacy brands with a lot of baggage to shed will need to be clear early on about the resource requirements for a complete repositioning and rebranding. Just ask Facebook – now known as Meta.</p><h2><strong>2. Let your customers do the talking</strong></h2><p>Whether evolution or revolution, a branding exercise should always begin by evaluating audience insights. This is even more crucial for well-established heritage brands, where brand associations will be long-held and deeply rooted. Certain markers of a brand really matter to its  audience.</p><p>You need to quickly ascertain  what is worth retaining about the brand. What brand associations are helpful, and which ones are holding you back from achieving your long-term goals? How do you delight your customers and, more importantly, how do you disappoint them? If brand is what your customers say about you when you’re not in the room, your job is to familiarize everyone in your organization with the gossip.</p><h2><strong>3. Sharing is caring</strong></h2><p>A problem shared is a problem halved. Brand is the responsibility of not just its designated manager or team, but of every individual within an organization. <a href="/opinion/2020/02/26/your-people-are-your-brand">Brands are built by their people</a> – by those who design the experience of using them, by those who talk about them, by those who understand and advocate for them.</p><p>When it comes to large, long-standing, global organizations, it can be easy for everyone to forget that they are working for a common cause and towards a shared vision. Brand, when done well, can be that north star. If the branding process is inclusive and consultative enough, you’ll build a groundswell of belief from the bottom up. This is extremely powerful – not only in securing senior buy-in and backing, but also in delivering the newly revitalized brand to the world. </p><h2><strong>4. Nostalgia is a golden thread and a brand’s best friend</strong></h2><p>Some of the most successful and memorable rebrands of recent years have drawn on a brand’s past to help catalyze its future. We found this at Oxford University Press, where delving into our archived crests, dating back as far as the 18th century, and our original letterpresses and castings helped influence design decisions fundamental to our new identity.</p><p>From the ‘future retro’ reimagining of the <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2021/01/12/burger-king-rebrand-retro-logo/">Burger King logo</a> (a new take on ‘when the brand looked its best’) to <a href="https://www.futurebrand.com/our-work/natwest">NatWest’s trawl of its brand archives for a new visual system</a> built around its original icon from 1968, there is power in connecting your past to your present and future. Not only does this give you – and your customers – a continuum of look, feel and tone; it also reinforces a sense of omnipresence throughout the years. In my experience, I have also found that this helps with internal buy-in – even the most change-resistant skeptics will find their argument weakened by a clear throughline, drawn from where you have come to where you are going.</p><p>Brand is nothing if not a simple story, well told. For heritage brands, a rebrand is a wonderful opportunity to begin a new chapter.</p><p><strong>Tamira Hamam is head of brand and digital communications at Oxford University Press.</strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>On the heels of a handful of developments across the globe, including new data protection bills signed into law by both <a href="/insight/2021/11/15/pipl-what-you-need-know-about-china-s-personal-information-protection-law">China</a> and Saudi Arabia, experts speculate on how the data privacy legislative landscape will shape up in the coming year and beyond. </strong></p><p>As 2021 draws to a close, India, Canada, Vietnam, South Korea and a smattering of countries around the world are reviewing proposed data privacy bills. Meanwhile, recent amendments to Japan’s Act on the Protection of Personal Information will go into effect early next year and Australia is in the process of amending its 1988 privacy legislation. In the US, more than 25 state-level data privacy bills remain in limbo in various stages in committees.</p><p>Even with so much momentum, however, data privacy bills and amendments in the US and abroad are generally difficult to pass and sign into law. The pace of regulatory action lags far behind the pace of most market movements – and in lieu of comprehensive, consent-based data privacy laws on the national level, tech companies like Apple and Google are <a href="/news/2021/11/16/will-tech-companies-or-regulators-have-the-final-say-our-privacy-debate">increasingly setting the ground rules for consumer data privacy</a> and advertising industry groups are setting their own self-regulating standards. </p><p>The Drum surveyed a handful of experts about what’s next for data privacy legislation. Here’s what they said. </p><h2><strong>Prediction 1: US federal legislation, though desired, remains a long shot</strong></h2><p><strong>Jessica B Lee, partner and co-chair of privacy, security and data innovations, Loeb &amp; Loeb: </strong>Achieving federal legislation is highly unlikely in the next year or two. Next year, we will be halfway through Biden’s first term and facing the midterm elections. In addition to pulling us out of the pandemic, addressing issues of the supply chain and inflation, Biden’s biggest priority will likely be passing his signature legislation, Build Back Better. While we have had a number of bills introduced and hearings and interest around privacy, I remain skeptical that enough political resources will be devoted to privacy before Build Back Better gets passed. We will have to see what the political landscape looks like after 2002. If the Democrats hold both the House and the Senate, then we may see privacy legislation before 2024. If they lose one [or the other], then I think we are in a legislative deadlock until 2024. The opportunity here is that comprehensive privacy legislation is desired by both parties, consumer advocates, and industry – everyone wants to see this happen. The question is how and what form it will take and its hashing out those sticking points – particularly around the scope of preemption and a private right of action that will slow the process.</p><p><strong>Stu Ingis, coordinator, Privacy for America: </strong>Passing comprehensive federal privacy legislation remains a real possibility, because unlike many policy debates, there is actually a great deal of consensus across the ideological spectrum. A full 92% of voters – including 95% of Democrats and 89% of Republicans – say passing federal privacy legislation is very or somewhat important, according to a recent survey commissioned by Privacy for America… This means we have both a significant opportunity and a significant need to create a national privacy standard, and federal policymakers must prioritize doing so. We remain optimistic that they will. An additional impetus to action is the growing patchwork of state laws that confuse consumers, increase compliance costs for businesses, and threaten the many benefits that accompany the responsible use of data. The FTC will propose broad privacy rules next year at the same time as Congress is debating these issues. While the advertising industry would welcome uniform privacy rules, creating law through regulatory fiat is a recipe for bad policy that could have negative implications on important business practices and the economy.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Fiona Davis, chief operating officer, Captify: </strong>The news from the Biden administration this week [that the National Telecommunication and Information Administration – part of the US Commerce Department – will hold ‘listening sessions’ and solicit input on the interplay between privacy, equity and civil rights] is the country’s first step towards a stronger stance on data privacy legislation and indicates that there is definitely a strong appetite in the US for greater consumer privacy laws. [California, Virginia and Colorado] have already approved legislation, and many others are already well underway… Over time, states will likely make various adjustments to their own laws based on what’s working and not working... but without an overarching federal framework, state-based legislation will continue to drive the privacy agenda in the US.</p><p><strong>Arielle Garcia, chief privacy officer and senior vice-president of business operations and compliance, UM Worldwide: </strong>It does not appear likely that there will be a comprehensive federal privacy law passed within the next year. It is more likely that the Federal Trade Commission will continue to take a broad read on its role in enforcing existing law, as we saw with their <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/public-statements/2021/09/statement-commission-breaches-health-apps-other-connected-devices">recent policy statement</a> [on data breaches by health apps]. It’s also likely that more limited federal proposals dealing with high-priority, privacy-related and privacy-adjacent issues will advance, such as enhancements to children’s privacy, as well as social media and algorithmic transparency. The two main sticking points on comprehensive federal law hindering bipartisan alignment have been preemption and private right of action, and there does not appear to be sufficient progress towards consensus on these issues.</p><h2><strong>Prediction 2: Ad industry self-policing will become more stringent</strong></h2><p><strong>Stu Ingis, coordinator, Privacy for America: </strong>The advertising industry has been ahead of the curve in self-regulation of data practices for more than two decades. This will continue and expand through efforts like the Partnership for Responsible Addressable Media. Almost every area of law that impacts advertising has a corresponding self-regulatory framework that will continue to benefit the advertising ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Walter Harrison, founder and chief executive officer, Tapestri: </strong>Self-policing is better than no policing; whether it’s Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) or the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), providing a centralized opt-out for consumers is a net positive. In our experience, the DAA provided a sense of comfort for the consumer. With that said, policies should still be written in partnership with the industry, not necessarily ‘just against’.</p><p><strong>Anthony Katsur, chief executive officer, the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Tech </strong><strong>Lab: </strong>Let’s be candid. Even though it has been well intentioned, the industry has not done an effective job of self-regulation as it relates to consumer privacy. However, I believe the tone has changed across the ecosystem. Government regulations, combined with big tech activity in the area of privacy, [have] acted as a forcing function for the entire industry to address issues of consumer consent and data privacy with incredible urgency. I don’t think any solution should rest with any single entity, government, private company or trade body. [All players] should work together to preserve addressability while maintaining rigorous standards around consent and privacy protection with real enforcement and penalties for bad actions. I think a private-public partnership in this area would best serve the entire digital media ecosystem and our most important constituent, the consumer.</p><p><strong>Jessica B Lee, partner and co-chair of privacy, security and data innovations, Loeb &amp; </strong><strong>Loeb: </strong>These groups will start to pivot to co-regulation. From the standpoint of privacy advocates and regulators, self-regulation has not worked – it has not gone far enough or moved quickly enough to address the privacy harms that comprehensive privacy regulations aim to solve. Instead of self-regulation, I think industry groups will start to build solutions to support the industry’s efforts to comply with regulations – we have seen the IAB and the IAB Tech Lab move in this direction. I do think it is important that the industry have a seat at the table. The flow of data through the advertising ecosystem is very complicated and understanding those nuances and being able to craft solutions that address the privacy concerns without crushing the industry is important.</p><h2><strong>Prediction 3: Tech companies will continue rolling out ‘draconian’ policies</strong></h2><p><strong>Joe Doran, chief product officer, </strong><strong>Epsilon: </strong>Big tech platforms and walled gardens will continue to roll out draconian policies and new solutions in 2022 in the name of consumer privacy. These solutions will bring complexity and frustration to advertisers, publishers, developers and to the consumers they are trying to help. At the end of the day, these policies and solutions really just seem to benefit [tech companies] themselves and the economic moats they have created. The actions of big tech are all done under the guise of providing greater transparency and choice for the consumer – which is great, and I fully support – but big tech’s application is really done for their consumers and the data they collect inside their walled garden or their platform. They aren’t really helping the advertisers, publishers, developers or the consumers out on the open web or across the ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Arielle Garcia, chief privacy officer and senior vice-president of business operations and compliance, UM Worldwide: </strong>Many of the changes by big tech are attempts to preempt and evade regulatory action that would be most damaging to the platforms, and there is a balancing act between advancing privacy-enhancing changes without attracting greater competition scrutiny. To that end, we’re likely to continue to [see] more measured actions by the platforms as it grows increasingly critical to mitigate the perception that their changes result in anti-competitive effects. For example, Apple recently began prompting for opt-in consent to Apple’s use of data for ad personalization, more in alignment with its AppTrackingTransparency policies for app developers.</p><p><strong>Müge Fazlioglu, senior Westin research fellow, International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP): </strong>Where there is regulatory inaction, companies will fill the gaps – for better or worse. And this is so true in privacy today, which we know is something US consumers want and even expect, but [something] on which lawmakers are still divided. We will see more companies in competition over who offers the most privacy and security to consumers, and we will see more initiatives like the one announced by Twitter [this week] that it will not allow sharing of photos and videos without consent, with exceptions for things like public information and public interest. So, the dilemma for lawmakers will be how to craft laws that resonate with what consumers want and industry is doing – which is so hard to pin down – and avoid trying to impose obligations that no one agrees with.</p><p><strong>DJ Landreneau, director of data privacy strategy, policy and compliance, Tealium: </strong>We don’t believe that tech companies are leading the regulations in a meaningful way in Europe. To a degree it can look that way, since regulators are constantly chasing new technology as it emerges. A recent example is <a href="https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/news-and-blogs/2021/01/adtech-investigation-resumes/">the investigation led by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office and Belgium’s Data Protection Authority</a> on real-time bidding. Even though it has been known that the real-time bidding practices are out of compliance with GDPR, the regulators are challenged by trying to chase after the ever-changing complexity of the technology. However, in the US, companies have had more of a hand in shaping, or preventing, regulations – resulting in regulations that are more in the companies’ interest than the end-users’. Florida’s privacy legislation failed to pass because businesses lobbied against private right to action, demonstrating that business interests [often win out] over end-users rights.</p><h2><strong>Prediction 4: The global wave swells</strong></h2><p><strong>Fiona Davis, chief operating officer, </strong><strong>Captify: </strong>At this point, nearly all countries globally are looking at some level of data privacy legislation, often using the GDPR as a blueprint and then adapting for their own market. Specifically in the US, they won’t necessarily be influenced by global lawmakers, but global action certainly adds fuel to the fire – it is a global phenomenon that the US needs to take a serious stance on, and is driven by consumer demands globally to address their data privacy rights in a meaningful way. There is a general trend of moving away from identity-based tracking. Consumers have made it clear that they do not want to be tracked at a user-by-user level, and global legislation will move increasingly towards this. More intrusive methods such as precise geo-location-based tracking and targeting will continue to be challenged by regulators in all markets.</p><p><strong>J Trevor Hughes, chief executive officer and president, International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP): </strong>We should expect many more privacy and data protection laws in the coming year. Complexity will increase. Risks for non-compliant organizations will balloon. The trend lines indicate that both the number of countries with comprehensive laws and the complexity and divergence of those laws will increase. It is very likely that we will see India pass a data protection law in the early part of 2022. The bigger question – perhaps the biggest question – is when the US will find the political will to see a national privacy law enacted.</p><p><strong>Mario Ciabarra, chief executive officer, Quantum </strong><strong>Metric: </strong>The EU set the bar on privacy first with the GDPR, and we’ve seen others such as Canada, Saudi Arabia and China follow suit. In the US, we’ve seen states attempt to tackle this – such as California’s CCPA. This is making it more and more difficult for online businesses to navigate the world’s complex array of laws on privacy, especially when each law looks different. What we are going to start to see is that this spider web of rules will actually start to negatively impact smaller businesses who have a hard time keeping up with the growing list of global regulations. These businesses simply don’t have the manpower that an Amazon or Apple would have to track changing rules across the globe. We really need to establish a global organization that can help set that gold standard for data privacy. So far, the GDPR sets the highest standard and most comprehensive set of rules and penalties, and, generally speaking, abiding by the GDPR’s already-complex laws provides a strong guidance of how to take a privacy by default approach.</p><p><strong>DJ Landreneau, director of data privacy strategy, policy and compliance, </strong><strong>Tealium: </strong>We believe the spread of GDPR-style regulations across the globe is largely driven by a desire to be able to process EU data... Since countries without the appropriate ’level of adequacy’ aren’t allowed to process EU data, there’s a significant financial incentive for countries to pass their own regulations for their national companies to process EU data. It would be very  surprising if the US doesn't eventually feel that pressure and move in a similar direction, especially because recent court decisions have made it clear that the US does not currently qualify as ’adequate’, and therefore EU data may not be processed there. Action across the globe will influence businesses and their desire to access those markets, the businesses in turn will influence US lawmakers to take action. Eventually the global community will need to align and agree on privacy legislation. If trying to maintain compliance with 50 different US states’ laws seems daunting, imagine trying to maintain compliance with 195 different countries’ laws.</p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>We catch up with Kim Lim, the managing director for Malaysia at Universal Music, to hear how the Vivendi-owned entertainment group is working with ReverseAds to identify relevant audiences by device ID rather than cookies.</strong></p><p>With Google’s decision to delay the removal of third-party cookies data until 2023, the ad industry and publishers now have more time to migrate services before the three-month cookie phaseout.</p><p>However, it does not change the timeline for marketers to take a clear look at their reliance on third-party cookies to assess any potential impact and possible solutions. They also need to understand their first-party data and fill the void from third-party cookies by inventorying.</p><p>One brand that has started doing this is Universal Music, which says it is “diligent” about collecting and protecting its first-party data so the opportunities for growth and differentiation seem obvious.</p><p>“At Universal Music, we focus on predicting future actions of marketing professionals to educate them on the benefits of amplifying their brands with music,” explains Kim Lim, managing director for Malaysia at Universal Music.</p><p>“Because of the first-party data that we collect when people land on our websites or come to our events, we can identify an audience pool of key decision makers engaging with our keywords, competitors and related content, and introduce them to the idea of sponsoring an artist.”</p><p>She adds: “Signups, registrations and knowing more about the consumer are going to help some of our first-party data. We have also seen an acceleration of the signup trend, with people being more willing to opt in when we increase the amount of free content that we have to offer.”</p><p>To predict the path to purchase and serve buyers’ ads until they convert while using cookieless tracking, the Vivendi-owned music giant is working with ReverseAds to identify relevant audiences by device ID rather than by using cookies.</p><p>The adtech firm is also providing Universal Music with the most accurate targeting by looking at real-time content and keyword searches – without invading personal privacy.</p><p>“ReverseAds’ tracking is compliant with GDPR, PDPA, CASL and CCPA, and is not using third-party cookies. Instead of tracking user-level personal identifiable data, their solution focuses on campaign-level engagement data specifically tied to intent on a keyword,” says Lim.</p><p>“The information stored is 100% anonymous, yet they can read engagement specific to that user, thus restoring user privacy and data ownership. By using ReverseAds’ privacy-first keyword road-mapping algorithm as an alternative to traditional search advertising, Universal Music can stand out from the crowd and connect with customers on the open web to increase our reach and conversion opportunities.”</p><p>For example, when Universal Music launched a 60-day campaign, specifically to identify marketing leaders and introduce them to the benefits of amplifying their brands with music, ReverseAds helped the company market its catalog of signed artist profiles to brand leaders in Malaysia and Singapore.</p><p>“With ‘Reverse ABM Ads,’ ReverseAds provides us with the option [of] the exact audience we want to target with its privacy-compliant system, which does not collect or store user-level data,” notes Lim.</p><p>“Their network reach uses a cookieless solution to follow users across all devices; serving them ads until they engage or convert. We look forward to seeing results and getting more artists sponsored.”</p><p>Looking ahead, due to consumer expectations for privacy and the rapidly-evolving regulatory environment, email identifiers such as the Unified ID 2.0 may not always be a sustainable long-term strategy, cautions Michael Hahn, founder and chief executive officer of ReverseAds.</p><p>While the purpose of the identifiers is to bring addressability to the open web in the absence of third-party cookies, he questions if enough consumers consent to their email being used as an ID for ad targeting, and how will brands get them to do it.</p><p>“Some publishers have said they will not use identity tech and will remain as subscription-based businesses, but the majority of publishers don’t have that luxury. Not all media brands want or intend to go fully behind the paywall,” he explains.</p><p>“Businesses should be more thoughtful and strategic about the most viable options to replace third-party cookies by conducting due diligence, which can help move the entire digital advertising industry toward a better value exchange with consumers.”</p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>There are plenty of interesting, funny or absurd ads out there, but what spots are truly effective when it comes to connecting with consumers for the long term? System1 has developed its ‘star rating’ scoring algorithm to answer that very question. Jon Evans, chief marketing officer at System1, tells us which ads were most effective last month and why.</strong></p><h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2><p>System1 tests ads on measures that predict long-term brand growth (Star Rating) and short-term sales growth (Spike Rating) – each between one and five stars. These measures are validated using the independent IPA database and also against real sales data at a category level.</p><p>The Star Rating captures the emotional response to an ad – viewers are asked what they felt about it and how strongly. Only 1% of ads on the system score five stars. A one-star ad will have zero effect on brand growth, while a five-star ad will have an exceptional impact (up to three points of market share gain, depending on investment). It’s important to score well – and it’s rarely the work you think that comes on top.</p><p>Evans talks us through the top five performing ads in the US in November.</p><h2><strong>November’s top ads</strong></h2><p><strong>5) Kohl’s: Dance with all your heart</strong></p><p><em>Star Rating: 4.7</em></p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39381 --><p>A grandparent/grandchild story rounds out the list, with a nervous boy asking his grandma to dance at a Christmas gathering. It’s a charming vignette of a very traditional family Christmas, which lands its emotion through the facial expressions and the sense of ‘betweenness’ between the boy, grandmother and her husband working the gramophone. A carefully-positioned Kohl’s gift box makes sure the brand gets in on the act without getting in the way.</p><p><strong>4. Macy’s: Tiptoe and the flying machine</strong></p><p><em>Star Rating: 4.8</em></p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39382 --><p>Macy’s is one of America’s most consistent Christmas brands – it topped the US System1 list last year with a celebration of small-town community and a story of some magic shoes. This year it has opted for a very European-style Christmas ad – an animated story of Christmas friendship that could easily have come from one of the UK or Germany’s big retail brands. The story of Tiptoe the reindeer gets the emotions going with a 4.8-star score, but is a little disappointing on short-term impact and brand recognition –  a sign that while Macy’s has created a lovely story, it has not managed to stamp it with its own distinctive brand.</p><p><strong>3. Disney Resorts: Magic is here</strong></p><p><em>Star Rating: 4.8</em></p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39411 --><p>While Disney’s home streaming service thrived during the pandemic, its resorts had a much rougher time. Visitor numbers plunged and the Magic Kingdom has sought to woo people back with a new positioning: ‘Magic is here.’ It’s a tagline that stresses how great it is to experience Disney in real life, and the very strong scores for this festive version of the campaign suggest it’ll do the job.</p><p><strong>2. Etsy: Give more than a gift</strong></p><p><em>Star Rating: 5.2</em></p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39384 --><p>Etsy’s brand is all about unique, personal gifts, and it uses that to make a point about inclusion in this ad. It’s the story of a Black grandpa who makes sure his grandchild gets to meet Santa when they’re out shopping – but feels a little sad he can’t be Santa himself. Fortunately, thanks to Etsy, there’s a gift out there that proves Father Christmas is a more inclusive concept that he thought. It’s an ad that crams a whole lot of story into 30 seconds, but pulls it off thanks to some great non-verbal communication between the older man and the boy. A lovely piece of craft and a worthy 5-stars.</p><p><strong>1. Lindt: Delicious taste</strong></p><p><em>Star Rating: 5.4</em></p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39410 --><p>Lindt is a heavy hitter, even in the highly competitive chocolate and candy category – it’s scored many a 5-star ad with a relentless focus on the aesthetic pleasure of chocolate (always created by its handsome ‘master chocolatier’ of course). The Christmas ad is no exception – a Lindor chocolate here works as a way to heighten a magic moment of Christmas cheer. Subtle it ain’t, but Lindt knows exactly what it is doing by now – every second of the ad contributes to the sense of indulgent pleasure, and it’s no surprise to see it land another 5-star score for the brand.</p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>Tesco has revealed a swathe of new ways for brands to advertise to millions of its customers as it sets itself up as a media owner that can rival the reach of Sky, Channel 4 and Facebook. </p><p>Until now the UK’s biggest retailer has arguably lagged behind the likes of Amazon and Walmart – owner of its main UK competitor Asda – which have been honing their retail media offering to marketers for some time.</p><p>Powering the strategy is a newly created ‘Media and Insight’ division of Dunnhumby, the retailer’s data analytics arm, which promises to help brands and their media agencies engage more effectively with Tesco's customers.</p><p>Underpinning the entire offering is Tesco Clubcard, which is now used in 80% of transactions by more than 20 million households in the UK. Tesco says this data can not only help marketers target ads across its vast media real estate but enable them to shape new products coming to market.</p><p>“As the UK grocery sector evolves, we want to ensure we provide a more relevant and personalized offer to meet our customers’ changing needs," says chief customer officer Alessandra Bellini.</p><p>"Our new platform will bring together the wealth of customer knowledge we have, with the insights from Dunnhumby, and use it in a way that helps our brands to be more efficient and targeted and ultimately to serve our customers better."</p><p>Here’s a breakdown of the offering.</p><h2>Media</h2><p>Tesco’s big pitch to brands is that it can rival some of the biggest media owners in the UK in terms of its reach. It claims that campaigns run via Tesco Media will be seen by up to 58% of the British population each week; that’s higher than Sky and equalling the reach of Channel 4 and Facebook. So it's launched ad products in five areas: </p><p><strong>Website and App</strong></p><p>Tesco’s online platforms record over 65m visits every month. New products to reach that audience include:</p><p><em><strong>Onsite display advertising</strong></em>: it’s massively increased the inventory available on its grocery site with a variety of new display and banner ads options which can be bought programmatically by next year.</p><p><em><strong>Relevant sponsored search</strong></em>: it’s been trialling this since earlier this year but has expanded the range of product and category searches that brands can sponsor.</p><p><strong>In-store </strong></p><p>Over 11 million shoppers visit Tesco stores each week. </p><p><em><strong>Tesco Radio</strong>:</em> It trialled in-store radio six months ago and introduced advertising for its own-brand items. It saw a 12% uplift in sales and is now expanding the trial with six external brands. It expects a full launch in April.</p><p><em><strong>Scan as you shop</strong></em>: Over 50m transactions take place using its scan as you shop devices. So now it’s putting advertising inventory on them. Brands could run an ad when the device is in a particular location (i.e a Coke ad in the drinks aisle) or an ad could appear for a complementary product once an item is scanned (ie an ad for Dorritos dip if a bag of chips is scanned). Trials begin in select stores in January before a full roll out.</p><p><em><strong>In-store digital display</strong></em>: It’s seen success in some stores with its in-store digital screens, particularly with beauty brands, and will be putting more in across its network in 2022.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Twitter announced today that co-founder <a href="/news/2021/11/29/time-fresh-thinking-market-reacts-jack-dorsey-resigns-twitter">Jack Dorsey is leaving his post as chief executive officer</a>. He’s been replaced by the company’s chief technology officer Parag Agrawal. Amid a handful of recent controversies and shrinking revenue margins, Twitter hopes the decision will usher in a new era of growth for the company.</strong></p><p>Jack Dorsey, chief executive at both Twitter and payment platform Square, has ended his tenure at the social media platform that made him a billionaire.</p><p>The executive, reportedly worth some $11.8bn, is stepping down. Twitter’s chief technology officer Parag Agrawal will take Dorsey’s place as chief executive, effective immediately. Dorsey will sit on the board until his term ends in 2022, per a statement.</p><p>“I’ve decided to leave Twitter because I believe the company is ready to move on from its founders,” said Dorsey in the statement. “My trust in Parag as Twitter’s CEO is deep. His work over the past 10 years has been transformational. I’m deeply grateful for his skill, heart and soul. It’s his time to lead.”</p><p>Bret Taylor, who it was announced will succeed Patrick Pichette to become the company’s new chairman of the board, also sang Agrawal’s praises. “Parag understands Twitter and appreciates the company’s unique potential,” he said in today’s announcement. “He has been instrumental in tackling our most important priorities, including accelerating our development velocity, and I know he’ll hit the ground running to strengthen execution and deliver results.”</p><p>Agrawal, who holds a PhD in computer science from Stanford University, joined the social media giant in the fall of 2011, eventually making his way up the ranks to become chief technology officer in 2017. As chief technology officer, he spearheaded the company’s machine learning and AI capabilities across the revenue, consumer and science departments. He’s also helped to lead Project Bluesky, an initiative <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106">announced in late 2019</a> meant to create an “open and decentralized standard for social media,” with the eventual goal of making Twitter a client for said standard.</p><p>Some experts see this succession as a logical next move. “Jack’s decision to resign as Twitter CEO, whilst surprising, is not totally unexpected,” says Matt Navarra, a UK-based social media consultant. Navarra says that Dorsey’s juggling of both Twitter and Square has frustrated some investors, even though he’s been fairly successful in navigating Twitter through a challenging period. “[Dorsey] had to make difficult and controversial decisions, such as banning a sitting president’s account, tackling online abuse and harassment on its platform and battling misinformation spread via tweets during a global pandemic. In addition, Jack’s leadership has helped Twitter speed up its product development activity with new platform features being cranked out at speed from a company which many viewed as slow to adapt and innovate.”</p><p>Navarra says that Agrawal is an obvious choice of successor, as he is not only a friend of Dorsey’s but also an outspoken proponent of crypto and Web 3.0, “a set of technologies Twitter’s outgoing CEO views as being at the core of the platform in the years ahead.”</p><h2><strong>History repeats itself</strong></h2><p>It is Dorsey’s second time stepping aside as chief executive at the social media company. In 2008, he was ousted; his co-founder Evan Williams took over from October 2008 to October 2010, eventually stepping down to focus more on product strategy. In his place was appointed Dick Costolo, who served as the company’s chief executive until the summer of 2015, when Dorsey once again took the reins.</p><p>Dorsey, who has not been at the center of as many controversies as tech rival Mark Zuckerberg, has nonetheless seen his fair share of drama. Among widespread allegations that social media platforms including Facebook and Twitter have propagated the spread of fake news and misinformation – and have also failed to effectively regulate abusive speech on their platforms – Dorsey has appeared before US Congress in a handful of instances to field questions from representatives.</p><p>Dorsey, for his part, promised to make changes to Twitter to make it harder to spread false information and to better protect users’ safety and wellbeing. And though the platform is far from cured of its ills, it has certainly made progress on these fronts.</p><p>Notably, last year, the company introduced a new feature that prompts users to read articles linked in tweets before they retweet them. The platform has also rolled out capabilities that allow users to restrict who can reply to their tweets and also hide specific replies from being seen by others. In January of this year, Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/suspension">publicly announced</a> it would permanently suspend the account of former US president Donald Trump on account of his continuous violations of the platform’s policies and his role in the January 6 riots at the Capitol.</p><p>Though Dorsey has had to contend with these and other controversies, he has spearheaded Twitter’s steady – albeit slowing – growth. Though the company grew its user base by about 7 million from Q4 of 2020 to Q1 of 2021, for instance, this rate was lower than what Wall Street analysts expected, per ​​Thomson Reuters data. And it’s not just user growth that’s looking sluggish; year-on-year revenue growth dropped from 25% in 2019 to just 7% in 2020. In an attempt to attract more – and more engaged – users and drive better financial performance, the company has in the past few years invested more deeply in product innovation. It has rolled out a number of new offerings, including audio-only Clubhouse lookalike Twitter Spaces and premium paid tier <a href="/news/2021/06/07/twitter-blue-explained-fee-you-can-undo-tweet-bookmark-and-more">Twitter Blue</a>. Under new leadership, the company will certainly be aiming to supercharge performance.</p><p>For these reasons, some experts think the timing of today’s decision is less than obvious. “It’s interesting Jack Dorsey believes the company should not be led by the founders. While he’s had a rocky road as the CEO, this past year we’ve seen amazing strides from Twitter with so many great new acquisitions and features, including the popular Spaces, and even a rise in stock value,” says Madalyn Sklar, social media expert and host of the #TwitterSmarter podcast. “I’ve always wondered how he could run both Twitter and Square. But he did it.” Still, she admits the decision makes sense. “With [Dorsey’s] trust and confidence in the new CEO, Parag Agrawal, I think we’ll see Twitter continue to push through boundaries that lie ahead.”</p><h2><strong>A new era of innovation?</strong></h2><p>Other experts believe the decision is a clear indication of the company’s desire to improve performance through innovation. “We’re entering a new era of social networking, where networks can and must exist as more than mere apps on a device that users log into once in a while,” says Mike Allton, a social media influencer and head of strategic partnerships at social media management platform Agorapulse. “To be successful in this new era, networks must find ways to be better integrated into the very lives of their users.”</p><p>Facebook, for its part, Allton says, is leaning into the virtual reality and the metaverse. But Twitter “has struggled for years to be relevant to mainstream consumers.” Allton believes Dorsey’s decision “is an acknowledgement that the Twitter network needs new, different leadership to provide the vision necessary to guide it into this new era.”</p><p>It’s also obvious to Allton that the decision is a financial one. As the company’s revenue margins shrink, Twitter is seeking new growth solutions. “While Twitter remains popular with marketers and journalists and celebrities,” says Allton, “the network continues to struggle to gain market share with consumers – the very consumers that advertising businesses and marketers are trying to reach. With billions of ad dollars flowing into upstart networks like TikTok, Twitter must find ways to adapt, and new leadership has the potential to make that possible.”</p><p>It’s clear that Agrawal has his work cut out for him. He’ll be tasked with boosting revenue, building up the platform’s user base and fueling ongoing product innovation, all within a challenging trading market and under the rule of increasingly stringent regulations.</p><p>Ultimately, says Navarra, the decision is likely to spell success for Twitter. “Parag Agrawal looks set to build upon the path Jack has set the company up to travel, which includes decentralization, Web 3.0, crypto, NFTs and a focus on social commerce, video and the creator economy. This will have been a hard decision to make, but ultimately it’s the right one, and one that is a fitting end note to this chapter in Twitter’s history.”</p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>Airport advertising inventory is on course to sell out this winter as brands bet big on a busy Christmas travel period.</p><p>According to out of home buyers, advertisers are scrambling for airport ad spots with many major global terminals having “extremely limited” or fully occupied spaces. Until recently, sellers were offering up to 80% discount to entice buyers, said Ashley Moll, business director for out of home buyer Quan, but now they can’t secure space until early 2022.</p><p>“Travel is back, and this has happened quickly,” Moll said. In high traffic areas in cities like LA and New York it’s been impossible to find inventory, she added</p><p>Meanwhile, Matthew O'Connor, chief executive officer of out of home agency AdQuick, said the deals for airport inventory have “evaporated” and demand has “increased significantly” – up 60% versus last year.</p><p>The rush to get a spot at airports this winter means the majority of advertisers are requesting digital spots as static OOH airport ads have a four-six-week lead time as they are harder to produce and install.</p><p>“We have lots of fast turnaround RFPs and clients looking to activate quick so [they] are requesting digital,” Moll said. O'Connor added that “programmatic digital OOH inventory is especially popular right now.”</p><p>“Generally, the inventory for large format OOH ad units at airports has tightened up,” O’Connor continued. “But smaller ad units like Wifi sponsorships, ordering tablet ads, and in-flight ads remain fairly available and are more cost-effective.”</p><p>This month's earnings update from outdoor firm Clear Channel offered more evidence of airport advertising's sudden boom in popularity. Its chief William Eccleshare lauded the rebound in airport advertising with airport display revenue in America alone up 88.7% to $43m in the third quarter.</p><p>"That trajectory has continued into Q4 and we are definitely seeing advertisers get excited about the fact that international travel is happening," he said.</p><p>O'Connor has also witnessed a broader range of brands interested in airport advertising. Airport spots have traditionally attracted B2B brands to reach business travelers, he said, but that has given way to B2C advertisers looking to “reach young, affluent digital nomads”.</p><p>Research from outdoor advertising firm JCDecaux recently claimed airport advertising delivers the highest perceived value for brands when compared to online, social, TV, and press. Compiled from the insights of 6,000 consumers in China, France, Germany, UK, and the US, JCDecaux found on an index basis airport audience scored 111 for perceived value and 113 for prestige, compared with TV’s 101 and 99 respectively.</p><p>While airports are getting booked up, Moll expalined there is still hesitation around trains and underground services. Pre-pandemic the New York Subway was “the number one place our clients wanted to be, but it’s still flat”.</p><p>Instead advertisers are keeping their powder dry. “We are still pitching trains and there are a lot of good deals to be had but there isn’t much hunger for it,” Moll concluded.</p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>We consider the week’s account wins, starting with conservative news channel GB News’s brief for London Advertising.</strong></p><p>Right-wing TV station GB News has appointed indie agency London Advertising to propel it beyond the south-east of England with a new marketing campaign.</p><p>Aiming to target British viewers that live outside London and the south-east, the campaign will include out-of-home (OOH), print, digital and PR activations.</p><p>In a statement, Angelos Frangopoulos, chief executive officer of GB News, said: “GB News is committed to serving the voices of the 86% of people who live beyond the south-east and London – the ’silent majority’ of Britain – so this campaign will meet them where they are.”</p><h2><strong>Why is GB News turning to advertising?</strong></h2><p>Since launching in June, the channel has struggled for viewers – during July some broadcasts attracted zero viewers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jul/15/gb-news-shows-attracted-zero-viewers-after-boycott-over-taking-the-knee">according to watchdog Ofcom</a> – but not for press. Most of that attention has been unfavorable, though, with The Financial Times concluding <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b61acb58-fb0c-427f-b3f4-a12509f764b3">”it just isn’t very good”</a> and The Guardian’s reviewer summarizing the station’s output as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jul/31/ive-been-watching-nigel-farage-gb-news-so-you-dont-have-to">”100% odious.”</a> Andrew Neil, the talismanic founding anchor of the station, left after presenting just eight programs; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/sep/24/andrew-neil-almost-had-breakdown-at-gb-news">he later said he came close to experiencing a ”breakdown” trying to get the channel off the ground</a>. Given its initial reception from viewers and critics then, any promotional campaign will be facing an uphill struggle.</p><p>For its part, the station believes it’s barely begun to reach the British population; new agency partner London says that half the British public haven’t even heard of it. Michael Moszynski, chief executive officer of London Advertising, said: “We know that 50% of Britons haven’t heard of GB News yet, so we need a compelling and gutsy campaign to reach them. Like GB News, our campaign is designed to challenge groupthink and misconceptions.</p><p>“Extensive audience research with our partner Yonder proves what we suspected: many opinions of the channel come from people who’ve never actually watched it. But most of those who have watched say GB News is a positive, enjoyable and refreshing offering. We have a powerful history of using our data to accurately read the mood of the British public outside the metropolitan media/ad bubble.”</p><p>Breaking beyond the “ad bubble“ of London and southern England may be one of GB News’s longstanding aims, but may not prove particularly lucrative; <a href="/news/2021/08/16/gb-news-popularity-boosted-boycott-campaigns-viewers-welcome-advertiser-absence">as YouGov’s Amelia Brophy previously noted</a>, its target audience of older viewers beyond the capital are “less receptive“ to advertising.</p><h2><strong>Moves you may have missed</strong></h2><ul><li>	Crunchy crispbread brand Ryvita has appointed Havas London, its first retained agency since 2017.	</li>	<li>	Pharma firm Eli Lilly has granted its US media business to Zenith, ending a 20-year relationship with OMD.	</li>	<li>	<a href="/topics/gocompare">GoCompare</a> has chosen to extend its time with <a href="/news/2021/10/21/meet-the-media-minds-hearts-and-science-s-garrett-o-reilly-uncharted-metaverse">Omnicom’s Hearts &amp; Science.</a>	</li>	<li>	<a href="/topics/mccain">McCain Foods GB</a>, the nation’s leading oven chips provider, has appointed We Are Social as its social agency-of-record. 	</li>	<li>	Publicis.Poke has expanded its global remit with client Essity; it’ll now be taking on e-commerce and global creative work for hygiene brand Tork.	</li>	<li>	Publicis Worldwide has been appointed by Swimming Australia.	</li>	<li>	Fintech Railsbank has picked Nelson Bostock as its PR agency.	</li>	<li>	Financial services firm Zip Co has appointed Mindbox to drive digital advertising and engagement.	</li>	<li>	Edtech company Rewise Learning has appointed Reg&amp;Co to help it develop a sponsorship strategy in the new year.	</li></ul><p><strong>If you’ve got a client win to tell us about, email me at <a href="http://businessonthemove@thedrum.com">businessonthemove@thedrum.com</a>.</strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Does the need to cater for remote and in-person staff, plus caution around rising cases of Covid-19, mean agencies are in for another unusual yuletide?</strong></p><p>Last year was a quiet one for the office Christmas party. In years past, staff might have expected tinsel in the boardroom, party games (fun or otherwise) and drinks on the boss. 2020, however, saw all that replaced by Zoom breakout rooms and a canned cocktail on the sofa of our cold, locked-down winter abodes.</p><p>With the festive season again approaching, many businesses – including ad agencies – are busy planning their end-of-year bash. And while some will be set on re-embracing the hedonism of years past, they may be going against the grain.</p><h2><strong>Agency advent</strong></h2><p>At Superunion, the Christmas party is set to return. Global chief executive officer Jim Prior tells The Drum: ”I think it’s great to have everybody together. The culture of any company has to have some degree of interactivity between its people. </p><p>”It’s an important part of life that people get together and just enjoy the company of other human beings. Working together isn’t always easy; you’ve got to create moments of levity, moments of humanity. Otherwise it’s miserable.”</p><p>Similarly, over at Dentsu, chief executive officer of creative EMEA &amp; UK James Morris says party season is making a comeback. Its creative agencies across the country are set to each stage their own Christmas parties, though they will each also be participating in a festive breakfast.</p><p>He says that this year it’s really important to bring parties back for staff. ”Equally, it’s also really important to be responsible as an employer and not put any pressure on your teams of people to feel like they’re obliged to attend, so we consulted quite heavily and spoke to people on all levels.”</p><h2><strong>Safety for the season</strong></h2><p>At industry wellbeing body Nabs (Christmas party: in-person), Paul Wells, director of wellbeing services and culture change, says there are a number of measures companies can put in place to make staff feel safe.</p><p>”Companies could consider asking for Covid passes and/or inviting attendees to take a lateral flow test before the party. However, asking for proof of vaccination could discriminate against people who have chosen not to have the vaccination or who cannot have the vaccine due to medical reasons and do not want to disclose their choice or medical reason and exemptions should be respected.  Ensuring your venue has current covid measures in place, in particular adequate ventilation is key to reducing risk and re-assuring attendees.</p><p>”Companies should also remember that this year in particular is one where people may not feel comfortable going to parties at all. There should be no pressure on staff to attend.”</p><p>Prior confirms that Superunion will be asking staff to take Covid tests before attending. ”We’ll ask people not to attend if they feel in any way unwell and we’ll ask people to take a lateral flow test,” he says. Dentsu’s Morris outlines a similar plan; its offices already require staff take a lateral flow and check their temperature on arrival.</p><p>For those agencies staging in-person Xmas dos, there may be an attempt to provide an alternative to the heavy drinking – or at least the heavy socializing – previously associated with the tradition.</p><p>VMLY&amp;R London, for example, is avoiding putting all its Christmas eggs in one party basket. Instead, it’s staging a whole series of events throughout December for staff, whether they’re in the office or working remotely. Alongside the ’traditional’ party will be wreathmaking classes, Hanukkah celebrations, a charity gifting drive, a virtual quiz and a family-friendly party in the office.</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39337 --><p>Justin Pahl, chief executive officer of VMLY&amp;R, tells The Drum: ”After the past 20 months, it has never been more apparent to me that it’s the little things that matter. While we are still 100% flexible, I am starting to see the benefits of people stepping back into the office and connecting in real life. And as we enter ’the most wonderful time of the year’, I want to give people a reason to come back and spend time with one another. So instead of one big blowout, we’ve created meaningful moments throughout the month. We’ve done our best to make this festive period as inclusive and accessible as possible.”</p><p>The agency is splitting its office party over two floors, one with a ”chilled vibe” and one set to ”party” mode. Wells suggests other agencies consider a similar set-up: ”Companies might consider organizing celebrations that don’t revolve around alcohol – perhaps something with various different elements that people can dip in and out of.</p><p>”Not everybody wants to, or is permitted to, drink alcoholic drinks. You should create a space where people can enjoy themselves with or without a drink in hand. An inclusive Xmas party is one where everybody feels safe and able to celebrate in a way that is comfortable for them and where their boundaries are respected.”</p><p>While Morris says the company doesn’t want to be too ”parental” towards employees, he says Dentsu UK hopes to ease the pressure on staff, whether they drink or not, by hosting its parties in the evening (rather than all day) and at venues with non-alcoholic options and mocktails on the menu. ”Especially for younger staff, they’re perhaps not quite forcussed on heavy drinking... we don’t want anyone to feel obliged to drink heavily.”</p><p>Wells also points out that Christmas parties – and the associated drinking – carry a ”heightened risk” of sexual harassment. TimeTo’s 2019 Christmas campaign, which Nabs supported as a founding member of the group, worked to highlight that risk, and Wells says it may be playing on the minds of some workers. He suggests agencies bear in mind that not every employee will be looking forward to the event. </p><p>”This is particularly pertinent this year as some companies will be holding their first IRL party for a couple of years. TimeTo’s latest research shows that 49% of adlanders are worried about sexual harassment intensifying as we return to offices, and this fear will certainly apply when it comes to the Xmas party. Organizations can create a safer atmosphere by reminding employees beforehand what constitutes inappropriate behavior, and reminding them that work parties are bound by the same HR rules as in the office.”</p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Today’s audiences want to see action, not ads or messages delivered from on high. They want to engage and belong within a community, experiences that brands can support in meaningful ways. The Drum finds out how brands like Four Star are trying to sustain a strong brand amid a fragmented digital landscape.</strong></p><p>Traditional branding has always been about a logo, a color palette, a typeface, or a slogan, and while this approach may make a brand recognizable, but it can also feel stagnant in today’s innovative world.</p><p>The aforementioned brand characteristics are largely reflective of how a brand wants to be seen by consumers, but it is not meant to engage with them as traditional branding is all about keeping up appearances.</p><p>How a brand presents itself is rigid as it is often with little to no input outside of senior leadership and the design team. This can alienate teams who are often reined in by these constraints for fear of misrepresenting the brands and limit marketing’s ability to show up in transformative ways as consumers’ needs evolve.</p><p>For Singapore-based mattress manufacturer and retailer Four Star, it associated itself with top-notch hospitality when they came on the scene in the 1960s. However, with the different needs of the younger generation today, it felt the brand has stagnated and it was time to hit refresh with a new coat of paint.</p><p>Then the Covid-19 pandemic hit and Four Star saw an opportunity to rebrand its business and appeal to younger consumers with brand and design management consultancy, Creativeans.</p><p>The consultancy was tasked with a complete rebranding of Four Star and conducted a comprehensive brand audit to reposition them for the new generation of consumers and market demands.</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39324 --><p>It developed a brand identity that visually expresses Four Star’s positioning, values, and personality clearly and impactfully to both external and internal stakeholders.</p><p>“One of the challenges is to have the ability to understand the current market demands and brand positioning of Four Star, as everything is unpredictable during the pandemic of Covid-19,” explains Ling Huat Sing, chief executive officer of Four Star.</p><p>“With the help of Creativeans, we can ease our rebranding process. We wanted to go for key opinion leaders marketing to build brand awareness by targeting young adults/families such as government flat owners or people that want a quality mattress.”</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39325 --><p>He adds: “Creativeans helps us to develop a clearer vision of the brand direction and position in the market. Therefore, we can understand and develop marketing strategies with the market demands of younger consumers.”</p><p>Ling observes that many people regard or misconception that branding as simply changing logos and taglines, for advertisement used that is fast and able to develop the aesthetics within a short timeline.</p><p>However, he says a branding exercise needs to understand the underlying company’s mission, staff perception, consumer perception and to align them and follow through.</p><p>“Branding should be a daily ongoing concern for all companies and employees including our communication (both Internal and External), as these are what branding is all about,” he says.</p><p>“However, the company should review and work on rebranding when there is a change of the business model or strategy/ direction such as the expansion of business or change of audiences, etc.”</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39326 --><p>Looking ahead, brands must continue to engage and embrace their consumers as part of a community as they want to see action, rather than ads. This means every experience a brand deliver becomes a reflection of its core products and services.</p><p>Brands can draw inspiration from fashion brands that attract consumers with an omnichannel experience during their purchase journey.</p><p>Ultimately, a brand is more than its product, and its logo and typeface. Brands must build advocacy among employees, create community among consumers, and ultimately make a positive impact on the lives of people.</p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><b>As Aldi once again strikes advertising gold with its unique take on <a href="/news/2021/11/11/ad-the-day-aldi-christmas-ad-sees-kevin-the-carrot-return-alongside-marcus-rashford">A Christmas Carol</a>, The Drum heads to work with the US animation studio whose cuddly carrot creation Kevin has captivated the British public.</b></p><p>The humble garden carrot has long been a fixture of the festive season, from being the favored snack of a certain infamous reindeer to fulfilling its dual purpose as a nose for snowmen. But in recent times, there’s been a new Christmas carrot on everyone’s lips; an underdog with a big heart, who we are all rooting for.</p><p>Since being introduced by Aldi’s ad agency McCann Manchester in 2016, ‘Kevin the Carrot’ has transformed the retailer’s advertising, earning a place among the great modern-day marketing mascots in the process. Such is the character’s popularity, there was a public outcry when Kevin failed to appear in the supermarket chain’s sneak preview of its Christmas ad earlier this month. To fans’ relief, when the final version of <a href="/news/2021/11/11/ad-the-day-aldi-christmas-ad-sees-kevin-the-carrot-return-alongside-marcus-rashford">‘A Christmas Carrot’</a> arrived, Kevin was duly present alongside new veggie pals Marcus Radishford, Tiny Tom and Peas and Goodwill.</p><!-- youtube:youtube--MIL8Kl-r0bo --><p>A unique take on ‘A Christmas Carol,’ the ad follows grumpy Ebanana Scrooge who is very much stuck in his ways. Viewers see him trudging through the snowy streets toward his home, and shortly after falling asleep he is abruptly woken by the Spirit of Christmas (Kevin the Carrot), who takes him on a journey through the wintry town to remind him of the true joy of the season.</p><p>Continuing to build on “the emotional connection he has with consumers” is the challenge each year, according to Todd Mueller, director at the animation studio behind the work, Psyop. It’s important to keep “blurring the line between advertising and entertainment full of charm, inventiveness and surprise.”</p><p>Throughout the years, viewers have been privy to the twists and turns of Kevin’s life, seeing him grow from a little baby baton to becoming a sound family man himself. Animating a 3p carrot and having people emotionally connect with it is every bit as ridiculous as it sounds, and its success, says Mueller, lies in the execution as “the smallest details – shape, eyes, mouth, legs and of course movement” make all the difference.</p><p>Sticking to the style of “less is more” and “resisting the temptation to add too much, and instead lean into the fact that making fruit and vegetables into characters is already charming and cute,” is key, adds Kylie Matulick, director at Psyop.</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39328 --><p>The team at Psyop, which is based in the US, started getting into the Christmas spirit back in June, with the whole filming process taking just over four months from start to finish. Aldi and McCann came to the team with the Dickens theme after it performed well in consumer testing.</p><p>Shooting was a mixture of remote participation and a smaller creative team on set. Kevin and all the other characters begin their lives as miniatures and are filmed with the use of a technodolly, a camera crane that allows for precise recorded repeated moves, which allows the team to stretch “the creative possibilities on set,” says Matulick.</p><p>One example of this is the town square, which “probably had close to 20 separate passes that were compiled in post-production to create the final result.” The team shot three of the cabins on a fixed plate, and once they captured all of the additional passes they “were able to rotate them all and complete the hexagonal layout,” she adds. </p><p>“Originally we intended to create the surrounding buildings in post-production, but decided at the last moment to utilize the existing buildings we had to create the structure around our outdoor market.  It really helped keep the consistency with everything else.”</p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39329 --><p>The creative execution of the animation relied on “subtlety and simplicity” to avoid looking too much like a cartoon as already “there is something so sweet, comic and ultimately lovable about a little carrot running around the world trying to do his best with whatever is thrown at him,” notes Matulick.</p><p>You need to consider the “real-world limitations of how much a carrot or banana could bend in reality, and find a balance of reality v a more exaggerated cartoon style,” she says.</p><p>This year’s new fruit on the block, Ebanana Scrooge, “was such a fun personality to bring to life in both of his forms,” says Kyle Cassidy, staff computer graphics supervisor at Psyop. “Seeing the brief history of how he became his grumpy self in the teaser was a fun glimpse into the past while reinforcing his present self.” </p><!-- news_components:news_components--gallery_item--39327 --><p>Pulling from historical references to design the setting for the story, the team “needed to arrive at a texture that had a sense of age to it, but without feeling gross,” says Cassidy. Accordingly, there’s a “little homage to the Bridgerton style.”</p><p>Eagle-eyed viewers were quick to point out a few Easter eggs in this year’s spot, with a hilarious dig at rival supermarket M&amp;S over the <a href="/news/2021/11/12/aldis-freecuthbert-campaign-takes-grand-prix-the-drum-awards-social-media">Cuthbert the Caterpillar</a> saga, but there may be some more that people haven’t yet noticed.</p><p>“There are a couple of ‘super insider’ ones, which we’ll leave a mystery, but those with a good knowledge of the previous stories should take a look at the little pictures on the wall of Kevin’s house in this year’s spot,” concludes Matulick.</p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p>The Advertising Standards Association (ASA) has rebuffed claims from environmentalists that it is biased and not doing enough to clamp down on <a href="/topics/greenwashing">greenwashing</a> after it decided not to ban a series of Land Rover Defender ads.</p><p>Green activists from Adfree Cities have criticized the <a href="/topics/asa">ASA</a> after its council overturned a draft ruling against Land Rover, with one member, Robbie Gillert, claiming the watchdog is “too slow, too reluctant to investigate and lacking any enforcement teeth if they do.”</p><p>The ASA has defended itself against complaints that it claims to “misrepresent” its funding model and “misrepresent” recent rulings on greenwashing investigations including EasyJet, Qatar Airways and Chevron.  </p><p>In a statement to The Drum, the watchdog reaffirmed its position as an independent body and that it “takes [greenwashing] very seriously, as shown by our many rulings in this area and our ambitious program of work we have coming up around climate change.”</p><p>The ad in question featured a Defender driving in the forest with the strapline “Life is so much better without restrictions.” The accompanying text claimed the vehicle has the “capacity to go almost anywhere and do anything. If you take one for an extended test drive ... a whole new world of freedom awaits.”</p><p>The ASA initially drafted a recommendation to ban the ad after it received 96 complaints that the ad encouraged damage to the environment.</p><p>The watchdog’s draft ruling said: “The overall impression of the ad suggested that the vehicle could be driven without any restrictions, including in ecologically sensitive and off-road environments such as forests, wherein doing so it would be likely to cause damage to vulnerable habitats and vegetation.</p><p>“We considered that the ad encouraged and condoned the use of a vehicle in a way that was detrimental to ecologically sensitive environments and was therefore socially irresponsible.”</p><p>The decision to overrule fell to the council, the ASA’s independent jury, which disagreed that the complaints broke the rules. According to the council, consumers would understand “Life is so much better without restrictions” as a slogan to refer to Covid-19 lockdown restrictions, rather than the environment.</p><p>They also determined that it was not “clear that the vehicle was definitely driving off-road, illegally or irresponsibly.”</p><p>The ASA said the decision demonstrated its robust process and evidence-led approach to final rulings.</p><p>“It is in the nature of a complaints process that those who don’t have their complaints upheld will sometimes feel disappointed,” it said.  </p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>The New York Times’ (NYT) international president Stephen Dunbar-Johnson tells The Drum: “We are not an activist organization.”</strong></p><p>After forming its dedicated climate desk in 2017, The New York Times climate coverage has evolved into a fully realized sector of the publication, with 12 full-time staffers and up to 80 journalists worldwide publishing 4,000 articles on the subject in the last year. </p><p>The publisher hopes that its multimedia climate offering will be an alluring proposition to potential subscribers engaging with the subject. However, it remains firm that, despite pressure from campaign groups, it will not cease to draw revenue from fossil fuel and other so-called ‘dirty’ advertisers. The Drum asked its international president Stephen Dunbar-Johnson why.</p><p>Prior to 2017, Dunbar-Johnson says that <a href="/topics/new-york-times-0">NYT</a> had taken a position of “balanced coverage” on the subject of climate change. “We were always going to look for the other side of the story.” </p><p>He says it was executive editor Dean Baquet who pushed for the publication to take climate coverage more seriously, recognizing it as “scientific fact, a man-made phenomenon and the biggest story of our time, which was when we realized we needed to cover the hell out of it, in-depth and consistently.” And so the climate desk was created.</p><h2><strong>Solutions-focused journalism</strong></h2><p>Since then, NYT’s climate coverage has grown to boast a team of 80 journalists, covering the emergency from around the world. However, “that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” says Dunbar-Johnson.</p><p>“Climate change touches everything. It’s a business issue, a health issue, even a religious one. We may have a designated climate desk but this issue touches every desk we have.”</p><p>Dunbar-Johnson stresses that so much of what we read on the subject of climate change tends to be “quite dystopian in nature,” but that in the hopes of leading the category, NYT strives to be solutions-focused in its coverage.</p><p>He says in many ways, this was the genesis of The New York Times’ recent Climate Hub at <a href="/topics/cop26">Cop26</a> – a 10-day program of panels and discussions from leaders and thinkers including Greta Thunberg, Al Gore, Stella McCartney, Vanessa Nakate and Emma Watson, all discussing and debating the complicated topic of the climate emergency.</p><p>“Cop26 was a critical global moment and we felt it was a great opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to journalism in the climate sphere, as well as showcase that much of that journalism is focused on solutions.”</p><p>However, he notes: “The further commercial backdrop is that it was also a great opportunity to grow The New York Times outside of the US. One thing about the climate crisis is that it is borderless and affects us all.</p><p>“So it was a very interesting commercial proposition to promote and claim our coverage to a global audience and drive that relevancy as to why they should subscribe to The New York Times.”</p><h2><strong>Driving subscriptions</strong></h2><p>Dunbar-Johnson says the digital-first content created by the climate hub allowed NYT to amplify its coverage to a broader audience. “We think that if we can get people to come and spend time in our ecosystem, we can get them to engage with our journalism and have a pretty good chance of keeping them there and converting them.”</p><p>He says the key audience it now wishes to target are the younger generations, who are undeniably engaged with the issue of the climate crisis but “they’re so used to getting stuff for free.</p><p>“We have a long-term approach to young people, and hope to show them value over time. The most important thing is engagement, and developing their relationship so they’re addressable and registered with us and then we can get a better sense of what they’re interested in – but we’re confident that we have enough good content to keep them engaged in this space.”</p><p>The New York Times is indeed seeing growth in its digital subscriptions. Revenue from digital-only products increased 27% in the third quarter of last year, while print revenue declined, and ad revenue also declined by 2.3%.</p><h2><strong>Ad revenue</strong></h2><p>The subject of advertising amid the climate crisis is one that has <a href="/news/2021/11/01/fight-the-soul-the-industry-adland-under-scrutiny-watchful-green-activists">seen much debate over Cop26.</a> Greta Thunberg called the conference “the global north greenwash festival” and campaigners such as Greenpeace executive director Jennifer Morgan (who herself spoke at the NYT Climate Hub) have spoken out <a href="/news/2021/11/09/your-credibility-the-line-greenpeace-boss-urges-ad-agencies-distance-oil">against fossil fuel advertising</a> and the social license to operate it provides so-called ‘dirty’ companies.</p><p>NYT competitor The Guardian became the first major news org to ban advertising from oil and gas companies last year. Dunbar-Johnson says that the NYT Climate Hub did not take fossil fuel advertising or sponsorship and nor does its Climate newsletter; however, this does not apply to the publication at large.</p><p>“We have an advertising standards team that checks our advertising on its veracity and if we find any untruthfulness we won’t accept it. However, the blunt reality is that advertising supports our journalism.”</p><p>The Drum asked The New York Times for clarity on what portion of its revenue is derived from fossil fuel advertisers, but it declined to comment beyond what is <a href="https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2021/11/Press-Release-9.26.2021-kIbBF9q04.pdf">published in its earnings report.</a></p><p>Dunbar-Johnson asserts that NYT accepts advertising from a broad church of organizations, but this does not mean it is either misleading readers or advocating for these companies. “People can advertise with The New York Times, the journalism ignores all advertising.</p><p>“We have many people working on climate, so if you see an Exxon Mobile ad running in The New York Times, it’s very likely we are going to have journalists holding Exxon Mobile to account in their investigations.”</p><p>He concludes that, as we move beyond Cop26, holding governments, organizations and companies to account for their role in the climate crisis will be at the heart of NYT’s committed climate coverage. </p><p>“We don’t see our position as being an activist organization, we see it as our role to inform our readers and to call out businesses and governments and hold them accountable – that’s our responsibility, and we take it pretty seriously.”</p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>YouTube today unveiled a handful of changes to its terms and conditions that will take effect early next year. Most of the changes have been made with the intention of improving clarity surrounding the platform’s terms and policies for everyday users. Here’s what you need to know.</strong></p><p>Just six months after <a href="/news/2021/05/25/youtube-s-updated-terms-service-explained">updating its policies to forbid personal data collection via facial recognition and rolling out new revenue taxation rules</a>, YouTube today announced it is updating its terms and conditions once again.</p><p>The changes revealed today, which will take effect on January 5 2022, are chiefly cosmetic changes that aim to help users better understand their rights and restrictions on the platform.</p><p>“We’re making some routine updates to our Terms of Service to make it easier for everyone to understand what they can expect as they use YouTube,” a company spokesperson said in a statement shared with The Drum. “This includes simplifying language where we can and providing some more detail in other areas to further increase transparency. There are no changes to the way our products work, how we collect or process data or anyone’s settings. These changes won’t affect the way people use YouTube.”</p><p>Key changes include the following:</p><ul><li>	<strong>Making service changes easier to understand: </strong>The video-sharing service has renamed its ‘Changes to the Service’ section to ‘Develop, Improve and Update the Service,’ which it says will “better reflect the content of the section.” Within the section, YouTube has reorganized and revised some content and issued an explanation for why it sometimes makes updates to the service. The company also outlined the advance notices it issues when changes that impact user access to the service are made – and users’ rights within such situations.	</li>	<li>	<strong>Consolidating information under the new section for service changes: </strong>In order to further improve the clarity of policies and user rights, YouTube has moved a number of clauses from various sections under the newly-named ‘Develop, Improve and Update the Service’ section. For one, the platform eliminated the section called ‘Terminations by YouTube for Service Changes’ – content from this section, which includes information about discontinuing YouTube services, will move to the new section. Some information about users’ ability to export content has also moved to this section from the ‘Account Suspension and Termination’ section. Additionally, a sentence detailing automatic updates from the ‘Downloadable Software’ section has made its way to the new section, alongside new language about when an automatic software update may be required.	</li>	<li>	<strong>Improving clarity around terms and changes to the agreement: </strong>YouTube is updating information about when it might adjust its terms of service in the future. The company will rename its ‘Modifying this Agreement’ section to ‘Changing this Agreement’ in order to “avoid any confusion with ‘Develop, Improve and Update the Service’ around modifying the service.” It will also polish the language within this section to make it more digestible for readers and outline some examples of when the company might make adjustments or updates to the terms and agreement.	</li>	<li>	<strong>Increasing transparency into its ‘strikes’ protocol: </strong>When YouTube users violate the company’s policies, they receive a warning. If it happens again, however, the user receives a ‘strike.’ YouTube penalizes repeat offenders on a three-strike system; if a user has received two strikes and once again violates community guidelines or policies, their third strike entails the user’s channel being permanently deleted from the platform. YouTube today announced it aims to “increase transparency” into this process. As such, it will now explicitly outline the Community Guidelines strikes process in the terms of service. The strike process itself will not change.	</li></ul><p>While these changes do little in the way of changing or impeding users’ day-to-day use of YouTube, they point to a larger trend of tech companies responding to user demands for greater transparency.</p><p>With consumer data privacy an especially hot topic among tech companies, publishers, advertisers and regulators are under more pressure than ever to provide users with explicit insight into how they operate. Considering that YouTube’s parent company Google is leading the charge with <a href="/news/2021/06/24/google-postpones-the-death-the-cookie-until-2023">the depreciation of the third-party cookie</a> and new <a href="/news/2021/07/26/google-clarifies-timeline-adoption-privacy-sandbox-s-floc-and-fledge">proposals for more transparent, privacy-centric advertising frameworks</a>, it’s no surprise that the video-sharing platform is making moves to improve user visibility into its protocols and policies.</p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Missguided invests heavily in influencer marketing. In fact, it takes the lion’s share of its annual ad budget. Now it’s doubling down on its reliance on content creators, believing they can take the place of ad agencies to manage everything from campaign ideation to production and distribution.</strong></p><p>Like many fashion brands, when Covid hit and shuttered high streets Missguided’s online sales spiked. In the year to March 29 2020, the brand’s turnover rose 8% to £202m. According to Drapers, between April and November 2020 sales were up 45% while the brand acquired 1.9 million new active customers since the start of its 2020/21 financial year.</p><p>In response, its marketing priorities also changed. “We stepped away from traditional media in 2019,” says Vicky James, its head of brand marketing.</p><p>“We’ve been actively working with influencers for a number of years, but it has definitely accelerated in the past two years with Covid and changing habits for how people are shopping, as well as the agility of influencers to really turn things around when we need.”</p><p><a href="/topics/influencer-marketing">Influencer marketing</a> now takes the highest percentage of Missguided’s advertising spend, more than TV or out-of-home when it chalks up activity across the year.</p><p>James continues: “We can be so much more agile with what we do through influencer marketing and it’s something that is to a degree measurable. We can actually show the true value of that channel versus a video-on-demand campaign where we can’t measure direct sales.”</p><p>In that regard, YouTube is where it’s seeing the best performance.</p><p>“It gives us the traffic and the sales we can measure trough tracked links. We see good sales within the first day of an influencer ad going live but still see it performing weeks after. That’s our biggest platform for ROI. The content, though, is a higher investment for the creators and producers, but we do see the biggest return.”</p><p>Second to that is Instagram, where it works with platforms like LTK  - a global influencer platform recently valued at $2bn that allows influencers to link to products via their on social platforms, blogs and 'LTK Creator Shops' - to measure through tracked links in its Stories function as well as in-bio. </p><p>“The downside is that so many brands now are using paid social there, so you do get lost and we have seen a dip in engagement,“ says James, suggesting that other platforms such as TikTok and Pinterest – which recently announced its own <a href="/news/2021/07/27/pinterest-enables-product-tagging-and-brand-partnerships-creators">Creators program</a> to encourage more influencers on to the site – are instead edging up the priority list. </p><p>Over the past year, it has also learned the value for money influencers bring to the table. The content they develop for YouTube or Instgram is then used by Missguided across its website and emails and in its paid-social.</p><p>“We’re saving on the creative spend,” says James, explaining that it’s increasingly relying on infleuncers – rather than traditional ad agencies – for the full end-to-end ad campaign, using them for everything from ideation through to creation of assets.  </p><p>“What we’re talking about now is how we utilize creators, or groups of creators, to do that campaign production hand-in-hand with us. There’s definitely a move away from these ad campaigns from agencies, especially for an industry like ours where we produce new stock every week and can’t wait eight weeks for an ad campaign. We need to be more nimble and agile.“</p><p>This is especially true in the face of the current supply chain crisis, which has hit Missguided hard. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/supply-chain-crisis-hits-missguided-and-matalan-kp70q5x3q">According to The Times</a>, its boss Nitin Passi has been on the hunt for emergency funding to help it overcome the problems faced from surging shipping costs and the labor shortages that have prevented it from sourcing stock in tight timeframes.</p><p>Instead of splurging budget on glossy ad campaigns that might feature products later hit by supply chain issues, influencer marketing is giving Missguided greater flexibility to promote what it has when it has it.  </p><p>“If we can produce campaigns with creators every two weeks or monthly where they’re getting that key product message out, that’s saving on the creative cost of sending a team out to shoot on location. There’s just not a need to do that. We’re looking to utilize creators more to produce those assets. </p><p>“It allows us to have a different point of view and, ultimately, then we don’t have a need to have a creative team or agency.”</p><p><em><strong>Missguided spoke to The Drum at an event hosted by LTK in London in October 2021. </strong></em></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>As we prepare to head off to our Thanksgiving Day celebrations here in the US, The Drum asked top industry leaders to reflect upon what they are most thankful for. They were encouraged to avoid the corny or the obvious. Here’s what they had to say.</strong></p><p><strong>Carla Piñeyro Sublett, senior vice-president and chief marketer, IBM</strong></p><p>Thankful for love in the workplace with friends who have become family.</p><p><strong>Raja Rajamannar, chief marketing and communications officer, Mastercard</strong></p><p>I am most thankful for my dogs. They are always there for me and my family every day. Dogs are wonderful creatures, and I believe we have so much to learn from their unconditional love, pure-heartedness and outstanding loyalty.</p><p><strong>Greg Hahn, co-founder and chief creative, Mischief</strong></p><p>I am extremely blessed and I have a ton to be thankful for. So for purposes of not making this À la recherche du temps perdu by Marcel Proust, I’m going to narrow this down to something I’m grateful for at this exact moment. I’m grateful for Wikipedia for answering, “what’s the longest novel ever written?”</p><p><strong>Marla Kaplowitz, president and chief executive officer, 4A’s</strong></p><p>I am truly thankful that the agency community has bounced back after a difficult year. Agencies leveraged the challenges of the pandemic and social unrest to iterate their offerings for clients and sharpen their efforts and actions on diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging in the workplace. Personally, I’m grateful that this year I can spend the holidays with family and friends and appreciate the important people in my life.</p><p><strong>Sir Martin Sorrell, executive chairman, S4 Capital</strong></p><p>Very simply, life.</p><p><strong>Danielle Gonzales, North American chief executive, iProspect</strong></p><p>In 2021, I am thankful for the ability to talk and act upon mental health needs at home and work. 2021 brought difficult moments for my family, teammates and friends. We suffered numerous setbacks like not making the team, not fitting in at school, losing loved ones, coming out, overworking, recognizing depression and experiencing overall mental trauma.</p><p>But unlike other years when mental health held a massive stigma, in 2021 we started to discuss our mental health needs publicly. We started sharing our stories and offering help and support in public and in a non-shameful way. For this, I am incredibly thankful. I’m thankful to all those who have offered their journeys and ideas on what help truly looks like, thankful for the grace to talk publicly together, thankful that we are in a time where we can discuss and help each other with our mental health needs. And something Robin Arzon said always sticks with me – “we can turn our pain into power” – and I believe her. I have seen my community turn their pain into mental healing power.</p><p><strong>Val DiFebo, New York chief executive, Deutsch </strong></p><p>This year I’m particularly thankful for my family’s good health and our ability to be together whenever and however we damn please. I’m grateful to our teachers who have heroically navigated our children through a difficult time experientially and psychologically. I’m thankful to my fellow Deutschers and our partners who show up, full force. I’m especially thankful for all the artists among us who were creating, working tirelessly to not only keep us nourished during the pandemic but have deep and entertaining work for us to see live in theaters and performance halls as we emerge from the darkness. I’m grateful for Central Park, my urban oasis, my place for mental nourishment and much needed Zoom breaks. Last but not least, I’ll never take toilet paper, sanitizer or yeast for granted again.</p><p><strong>Ann Wool, president, Translation LLC</strong></p><p>Giving thanks for all the relentless optimists in my world who wake up each day and embrace new possibilities with passion and vigor.</p><p><strong>Jen Costello, chief strategy officer, TBWA\Chiat\Day LA</strong></p><p>My tiny gratitude stream of consciousness, in no particular order: for AdWeak and Aisha Hakim’s tweets for reminding us how deliciously absurd what we do for a living is; for <a href="/news/2021/09/10/ad-the-day-lil-nas-x-and-elton-john-trade-legendary-looks-uber-eats">Lil Nas X for blurring the lines</a> between reality and fiction all dang year and showing us what real comms planning looks like; for androgynous king Harry Styles being all over my FYP, because it just hasn’t been the same since Prince and Bowie departed; and my one giant gratitude is that I can never unsee the ageism, racism and sexism embedded in how too many agencies operate – while being in a position to change it. Strategy directors hit me up.</p><p><strong>Tiffany Pham, chief executive officer, Mogul</strong></p><p>I am so grateful for the Mogul community. Our members empower each other with kindness, generosity and authenticity every day; they learn new things and support each other in their goals continually with the help of each other. I am so inspired that this platform, which I initially developed in my bedroom after teaching myself to code, has evolved into such a diverse global community.</p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Recent Reddit activity reveals that users are rethinking consumerism in a big way as they head into the holidays. Traditional holiday meals are being replaced with innovative culinary creations, shoppers are considering quality over cost, and the provenance and labor practices behind every purchase matter more than ever. </strong></p><p>Americans are more focused than ever on thoughtful consumerism – and it’s shaping everything from what they’ll have on the dinner table at Thanksgiving to how they’ll select gifts for friends and family, per exclusive new data from Reddit for The Drum.</p><p>The findings reveal sea changes are manifesting in three key ways: Redditors are rethinking holiday traditions; they are focused on long-term value over cost; and they are invested in the provenance and underlying ethics of what they consume.</p><h2><strong>Out with the old </strong></h2><p>For starters, increasingly users are tossing tradition to the wayside and engaging in conversations about nontraditional holiday meals – the platform has seen a 443% year-on-year increase in mentions of the term ‘nontraditional’ within the Food and Drink Interest Group. And compared to last year, there have been 96% more mentions of chicken rather than turkey heading into Thanksgiving. Users are sharing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/qcq7v2/whats_on_your_thanksgiving_menu_this_year/hhhmaky/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">the unique recipes they’re making this year</a>, ranging from lechón and rib eye to grape salad and curried meatballs.</p><p>“When we look at what Redditors are saying, and the community conversations we’re seeing, the biggest thing that we’re noticing is this birth of new traditions and a heightened sense of intentionality with all the purchases that they’re making,” says Rob Gaige, Reddit’s director of partner insights.</p><p>Gaige suggests that this shift is the product of a handful of coalescing factors. “A lot of it has to do with people reflecting back on ... the pandemic, the shrinking size of their get-togethers – or perhaps not having get-togethers – and certainly the different types of events they were having.”</p><p>It’s not just a stronger sense of intentionality driving people’s newly nontraditional approaches to holiday cooking. The change may also be tied to the influx of at-home cooking spurred on by the pandemic. Recent numbers from the marketing firm Acosta indicate that 65% of consumers cooked more at home during the pandemic and that 19% plan to cook even more at home post-Covid. And Reddit activity is still reflecting a growing interest in cooking; since last month, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldICook/">r/whatshouldicook</a> has seen a 22% jump in views; meanwhile <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/">r/recipes</a> views grew 26% during the same period. As people spend more time cooking, they’ve developed their own styles and tastes – and are reinventing what holiday meals look like along the way.</p><p>Other factors, such as supply chain shortages and a surge in adherence to plant-based diets (there’s been a 66% year-on-year increase in mentions of ‘plant-based’ diets in the Food and Drink Interest Group), are also shaping holiday meal planning. Reddit conversations are evidencing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thanksgiving/comments/pwmv8a/i_dont_know_should_i_be_worried_turkey_supply_is/">turkey shortages</a> that have left <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Shortages/comments/qunivr/aldis_is_out_of_turkeys/">grocers including Aldi with no birds to spare</a>. In response, Redditors are getting creative this year.</p><p>And for brands, the market is ripe for innovation. “For marketers, this boils down to the idea of consumer reconsideration,” says director of Reddit’s KarmaLab Will Cady. “It’s rare that you have an opportunity to present new products and new services amongst all of the tradition of the holidays. If people are reconsidering even the turkey, that’s an opportunity for something to come in and take its place. That was something we would think [would be] impossible in 2019 and maybe in 2020. But here on the other side of all this change, consumers are open to new traditions, and brands can be a part of that.”</p><h2><strong>Leaning into luxury</strong></h2><p>In tandem with rising inflation rates and global supply chain disruptions has been a spike in consumers’ interest in splurging on products they deem high quality. In categories such as fashion and tech, they are expressing less interest in bargain brands – and more in luxury lines.</p><p>On Reddit, this trend is evidenced in changing consumer sentiment and growing engagement with subreddits about high-end brands. Year-on-year, the platform has seen a 21% lift in mentions of the terms ‘quality,’ ‘buy it for life’ and ‘worth it.’ Users are increasingly agreeing that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/q2vamv/tshirts_and_jeans_may_get_more_expensive_as/hfp38zd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">quality matters more than cost</a>. </p><p>“People are just waking up to the fact that rampant consumerism is not sustainable,” says Gaige. “It just doesn’t work. And everyone’s thinking long and hard about, ‘How can I buy vintage, upcycle things that I’ve seen before or buy something once and then not have to replace it quite so frequently?’ And when you combine that with a sense of inflation, the cost difference ends up being a little bit less than they would have otherwise seen. So they’re saying, ‘I might as well just go ahead and upgrade.’”</p><p>Some brands have spiked in popularity more than others; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KithNYC/">r/kithnyc</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Barbour/">r/barbour</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/search/?q=r%2Farcteryx">r/arcteryx</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OmegaWatches/">r/omegawatches</a> have witnessed respective growth rates of 125%, 100%, 45% and 27% from October to November of this year.</p><p>And the impact of these conversations is substantial; 62% of users say that there are honest discussions on Reddit that help them evaluate which brands and products are best for them. Plus, Reddit plays an especially important role in shaping consumer behavior during the holidays – 41% of users visit Reddit to evaluate reviews on products or brands for gifts, compared with 33% who turn to Facebook and 28% who turn to Instagram for the same purpose. And more than eight in 10 users who conducted such research on Reddit made a purchase based on what they learned.</p><h2><strong>Consumerism with a conscience</strong></h2><p>In the same way that Reddit conversations are illustrating an increased focus on quality over cost, Reddit activity is also spelling out consumers’ growing attention to the provenance of the products they buy and the ethics of the brands behind them.</p><p>“Redditors are really great at trumpeting companies that are doing it right, and celebrating products and services that have a really positive history and a positive way of treating their workers,” says Gaige. “We’re seeing as a lot of people going to Reddit and saying, ‘Hey, I want to buy something, but I want to buy an ethical version of this product. Where should I look?’ And we’re seeing tons and tons of conversation around topics like that.”</p><p> Redditors have been championing brands that are not only providing products and services they love, but are also doing good for society at large. A Lego employee had the idea of assembling a Lego model of an MRI scanner to help healthcare professionals prepare children for treatment and make the experience more fun and less scary for them. The idea was a success, and Lego is now installing similar models in hospitals across the globe. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/nyykaj/lego_mri_model_at_a_hospital_imaging_department/">A conversation about the activation on Reddit</a> garnered some 2,700 upvotes. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Costco/comments/qw9zha/costcos_donations_to_a_food_bank_ready_to_go/?sort=top">A recent post about Costco’s donations to a local food bank</a> saw similar engagement.</p><p>At the same time, Redditors appear less interested in mass consumerism for the sake of it and more concerned about working conditions and labor practices. The platform has witnessed a 20% decrease in year-on-year mentions of Black Friday and Cyber Monday – some of which may be related to the massive growth of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork">r/antiwork</a> movement, which encompasses conversations about labor rights, progressive work policies and the pitfalls of capitalism. Views of the subreddit have grown 872% year-on-year and the subscriber count has increased 461%. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qd1hh3/antiwork_megathread_blackout_black_friday/">A recent thread</a> about boycotting Black Friday in support of underpaid hospitality and retail workers attracted 1,400 comments and 14,000 upvotes.</p><p>For brands, this represents a critical juncture. “At a minimum, it’s an invitation to rethink the creative for the storytelling behind your brand, your product or your service,” Cady says. “Think about how the culture has shifted. There is this mindfulness of the supply chain. There is this mindfulness of how these items end up on the table or under the tree.”</p><p>Of course, Redditors – like all consumers – can spot inauthenticity from a mile away. The growing demand for ethical labor and production is not a welcome opportunity for a brand to polish their image while failing to clean up behind closed doors, argues Gaige. “The worst thing a brand can do is to project an air of ‘I’ve figured it all out,’ because consumers don’t believe anyone’s really figured it all out,” he says. “A lot of what we see is celebration of the brands that are making steps, but more celebration for the ones that are founded on those principles from the get-go, [that have built] it into their core ... as opposed to just constantly attaching [their brand] to something and then trying to get credit for it. They get called out for that hypocrisy.”</p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<html><head></head><body><p><strong>Nielsen today unveiled a new framework for commercial TV ratings. The company said it will shift away from its C3 currency and overhaul its approach to crediting in order to offer more granular insights into which viewers see which adverts. </strong></p><p>Following <a href="/topics/nielsen">a saga of recent events</a> that saw <a href="/news/2021/09/01/nielsen-mrc-accreditation-suspended-following-accusations-underreporting">Nielsen stripped of its accreditation by the Media Rating Council</a> – after it was accused of systematically underreporting viewership data during the pandemic – the TV ratings and measurement company is back with an overhauled commercial ratings system. </p><p>The company today announced that in 2022 it will roll out a new system for establishing commercial ratings. Its existing commercial ratings currency, C3, offers insight into the average of all commercial minutes within a given television program. Under the new framework, dubbed Individual Commercial Metrics, Nielsen aims to provide advertisers with a more granular view into which viewers consumed which ads. Moving forward, audience estimates will be based on individual ads instead of commercial minutes.</p><p>In order to achieve these ends, Nielsen will revamp its approach to crediting – or pinpointing what publisher hosted what ad and what specific viewers saw that ad. A central part of this effort will be revitalizing its approach to identifying and collecting watermarks – audio codes inserted into an ad that allow Nielsen to match a specific ad run at a specific time with the viewer(s) who saw the ad. With the help of New York-based marketing logistics firm Extreme Reach, Nielsen will be able to detect watermarks more frequently within a given minute. As such, the company hopes to be able to credit viewership for individual ads and shorter periods of time during a specific program. Furthermore, Nielsen is integrating Gracenote Content Signatures, which aim to allow granular viewer crediting for moments in which watermarks are not present. </p><p>“Nielsen has been working on this technology enhancement for well over a year. This is the culmination of innovation and meticulous testing to ensure that we can meet the industry’s changing needs,” the company’s senior vice-president of product management Kim Gilberti tells The Drum. “Over time, we anticipate that buyers and sellers will begin to transact against the individual commercial metrics of a given ad, rather than maintain the current construct of looking at the average of all minutes within a program. This also supports more comparable measurement across platforms, both linear and digital.”</p><p>The move is part of Nielsen’s ongoing efforts to respond to widespread demand for more universal, cross-channel measurement currencies – <a href="/news/2021/05/07/the-ctv-ad-measurement-conundrum-creates-more-questions-answers">especially in the evolving world of connected television</a>. Amid a challenging, fragmented landscape, a number of US TV networks have taken it upon themselves to develop new approaches to audience measurement. <a href="/news/2021/08/23/nbcu-demands-measurement-independence-and-issues-rfp-solutions-amid-nielsen-scandal">NBCUniversal in August put out an RFP</a> seeking innovative approaches to measurement. WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS and others have also sought proposals for new frameworks. </p><p>Nielsen’s answer to the unrest is its Nielsen One framework, which is still in development. “The initial stage of this exciting evolution allows Nielsen to gather the data required for the launch of Nielsen One in late 2022. We’re excited about what this could bring to the marketplace in the future,” says Gilberti, who in May told The Drum that Nielsen One aims to offer a more “apples to apples” solution for cross-channel ad measurement. </p><p>Today’s announcement comes on the heels of the company’s <a href="/insight/2021/10/07/inside-nielsen-s-rebranding-strategy-post-mrc-scandal">recent rebrand</a>. </p><p><strong>For more, <a href="https://beat.thedrum.com/newsletter">sign up for The Drum’s daily US newsletter here.</a></strong></p></body></html>]]></content:encoded>
