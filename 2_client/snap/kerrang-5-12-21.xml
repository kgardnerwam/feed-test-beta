		<p>We like new music. So when Tim McIlrath was in London recently for <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/rise-against/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rise Against</a><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s acoustic show, we sat down with him for a&nbsp;chat about just that. He gave us five recommendations for stuff you need to hear now. Tim, take it&nbsp;away…</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Sincere Engineer</h2>	</div>
	<div>
		<p><span class="dquo">“</span><a href="https://sincereengineer.bandcamp.com/album/bless-my-psyche" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sincere Engineer</a> are from Chicago. I’ve actually seen them a&nbsp;couple of times and it’s mostly Deanna [Belos] and her band. I’d seen their name bounced around a&nbsp;little bit, but I&nbsp;finally listened to them recently and it’s got a&nbsp;cool, Mid-west emo vibe – this sort of new wave of very confessional, post-emo stuff like Spanish Love Songs. They’re just great – the production is amazing and the songs are amazing. Listen to Bless My Psyche, it’s cool shit. It was funny because I&nbsp;met her – and I’ve known the guy she dates for, like, <span class="numbers">20</span>&nbsp;years – but I&nbsp;had never heard her band. When I&nbsp;listened I&nbsp;was like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>This is fucking&nbsp;awesome!’”</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Spanish Love Songs</h2>	</div>
	<div>
		<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I just mentioned <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/spanish-love-songs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spanish Love Songs</a> and I&nbsp;absolutely love them. Again, it’s this very poetic, confessional kind of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-25-greatest-emo-albums-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emo</a>. It sounds like some of the stuff I&nbsp;was into in the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span><span class="numbers">90</span>s – it’s all very heart-on-the-sleeve. They do great, great songs – you know sometimes there’s those songs where you can tell the person’s writing from a&nbsp;very real, authentic place? That’s this band. I&nbsp;was vaguely aware of them, but then when we did the <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/descendents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Descendents</a> / <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/the-menzingers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Menzingers</a> tour, the Menzingers couldn’t do the first three dates because of previous obligations, and so Spanish Love Songs did them instead – they’re great&nbsp;live!”</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Teenage Wrist</h2>	</div>
	<div>
		<p><span class="dquo">“</span><a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/teenage-wrist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teenage Wrist</a> are like <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span><span class="numbers">90</span>s shoegaze – they just feed me my <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span><span class="numbers">90</span>s fix. I&nbsp;remember someone talking about them, maybe it was the <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/deftones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deftones</a> guys, and then a&nbsp;song of theirs just popped up and it was pretty cool – it was big, heavy and driving, but with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/jimmy-eat-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jimmy Eat World</a> kind of vibe on their hookier stuff. It sounds really authentic to&nbsp;me.”</p>

	</div>
	<div>
		<h2>Dead Sara</h2>	</div>
	<div>
		<p><span class="dquo">“</span>Dead Sara have got a&nbsp;new album called Ain’t It Tragic – that’s a&nbsp;fucking brilliant record. They’re the band where you’re just like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Why aren’t they the biggest fucking band in rock right now?’ And I&nbsp;have no idea because they’re just so good. I&nbsp;would say it’s got almost like some classic rock vibes, but it’s not trying to be classic rock – it just happens to be powerful like classic rock was. They’re one of those bands that just gets better and better. Like, you just think you heard their best record and it can only get worse from there, but this new record is even better. I&nbsp;finally saw them live, and Emily Armstrong’s fucking phenomenal. She’s fuck-ing phen-o-menal. I&nbsp;was just blown away by the whole&nbsp;thing.”</p>

	<div>
		<h2>Lyoness</h2>	</div>
	<div>
		<p><span class="dquo">“</span>I want to recommend <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/lyoness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lyoness</a> too! They’re fucking great. We asked them to do our [recent acoustic <span class="caps">UK</span>] tour with us, we kind of threw it in their laps, like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Can you play acoustic?’ and they said, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>No, but we’re going to do it!’ They’re super-cool, a&nbsp;great <span class="caps">UK</span> band and Gillian Maxwell’s amazing – she’s got a&nbsp;great voice. They’re just incredible. They’ve got a&nbsp;first <span class="caps">EP</span> coming out early next&nbsp;year.”</p>
