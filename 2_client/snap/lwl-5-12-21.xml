					<description><![CDATA[<p>Despite some compelling performances, Michael Pearce’s sci-fi thriller fails to live up to the promise of his debut, Beast.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>A</span> film I find myself thinking about a lot is Jeff Nichols’ <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/take-shelter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take Shelter</a> from 2011, in which Michael Shannon plays a father plagued by apocalyptic visions which lead him to construct a bunker beneath his property in Ohio. The question hangs over the film as to whether his premonitions are real or a symptom of mental illness; it’s a beautiful, haunting end-of-days drama that regularly springs to mind whenever I have a nightmare, or see a particularly overcast sky.</p>
<p>Michael Pearce’s second feature Encounter recalls Nichols’ work, but only in that it’s an inferior film which deals with similar subject matter. Riz Ahmed plays ex-marine Malick Kahn, who appears to be on some sort of covert mission concerning extraterrestrial parasites that are invading the world. He travels to his ex-wife Piya (Janina Gavankar) and her partner Dylan (Misha Collins) to rescue his young sons, Bobby (Aditya Geddada) and Jay (Lucian-River Chauhan). The trio then set off on a road trip to a base Malick believes should provide safety.</p>
<p>But not everything is as it seems. Violent run-ins with other people on their journey lead Jay to question his father’s story, and it soon becomes apparent that the threat may be closer to home than any of them wants to admit. Encounter has an interesting premise, but the film rehashes harmful tropes about the potential danger people with mental illnesses pose to others.</p>
<p>Time and again we see schizophrenia used as a plot device in films, usually painting people with the condition as unstable and dangerous to those around them. Encounter sadly typifies this stereotype, as the local law enforcement becomes convinced that Malick is a “family annihilator”. The film becomes so concerned with action scenes that it fails to challenge this preconception, and the sci-fi plot is dropped entirely once Malick’s psychosis is revealed, leading to frustrating a lack of ambiguity.</p>
<p>While Ahmed gives a typically strong performance, the real stars are Lucian-River Chauhan and Aditya Geddada. They have a charming screen presence and wonderful rapport with Ahmed, and really are the film’s saving grace among a plot that is at best ill-advised, at worst offensive to people living with a mental illness. It’s a shame considering that Pearce’s debut <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/beast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beast</a> felt like a more nuanced approach to mental instability and avoided presenting the most vulnerable members of society as a threat to their loved ones.</p>
<p>There is already a stigma around PTSD and mental illness in soldiers returning from war zones; Encounter makes no attempt to challenge this, instead leaning into the notion that trauma often leads to violence. It’s a deeply unpleasant and reactionary film that even compelling central performances can’t save.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>H</span>uman life is finite. Time’s relentless march brings us closer to the casket every single day. As such, we need <a href="https://lwlies.com/related-tags/steven-spielberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steven Spielberg</a> to be super selective when it comes to the films he choses to make. With three quarters of a century in the bank, and a workhorse ethic that has resulted in roughly a film every other year, we’re eking ever closer to the end zone of one of cinema’s most illustrious careers. Sorry to be maudlin, but it’s a fact.</p>
<p>“Everyone has their reasons,” as Jean Renoir famously mused, and the sublime mysteries of human inscrutability come into play when pondering the question: why on earth did Spielberg chose to make an everything-and-the-kitchen-sink rendition of West Side Story, the jazz musical conceived by Jerome Robbins and with music and lyrics care of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim? There was muted surprise when it was announced, and now having seen the film, a sense of perplexed irritation remains.</p>
<p>Curtain up. The camera presents a mid-century New York skyline in transition, the skyscrapers flanking a worksite in which grubby brick tenements are being wrecking-balled to make way for ritzy apartments and Lincoln Centre – an epicentre of American visual culture, here used as shorthand for chattering class gentrification. Set to the familiar rhythm of clicking fingers, we meet the Jets, led by Mike Faist’s Riff, as they execute a plan to ruin a mural on a Puerto Rican playground, contested territory of the Sharks, led by David Alvarez’ kiss-curled pugilist, Bernardo.</p>
<p>The first thing you notice is that this doesn’t look like a musical in the classical sense of the term. The colours are strangely muted, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski opting for pastel ochres and washed-out browns rather than the glowing reds of Technicolor dreams. The edges in the film are all softened – aesthetically and emotionally. The camera, too, manically dances and swishes around the actors, the sharp cuts slicing through the action in an overzealous attempt to stake the film’s claim as a piece of bells ‘n’ whistles cinema rather than filmed theatre. Initially the razzle dazzle does enough to hold the interest, but after a while it comes across as empty showmanship, technique at the expense of focus.</p>
</div>


        <img src="https://lwlies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/west-side-story-rachel-zegler-900x0-c-default.jpg" class="flex-fullWidthImage" />


        <div class="text__block"><p>Enter stage left, Rachel Zegler’s wide-eyed Maria, the department store cleaner with dreams of romantic escape. And then, from stage right, we have Ansel Elgort’s Tony, the Polack goon with heart-melting capabilities and a dark past. In the history of dramatic art, their cosmically-aligned love transcends the banal everyday to achieve something close to the magical sublime, and this particular story only works if that idea is conveyed believably and with staunch conviction.</p>
<p>Alas, here the chemistry between the two leads is negligible – even the massive height difference emphasises an awkwardness that really shouldn’t have been entered into the equation. Zegler is decent – clearly on the level with the fairytale aspects of the material. Yet there’s barely a moment where Elgort doesn’t feel as if he’s waded too far into the deep end, his small, dark eyes adding an air of unnecessary mystery to a character whose heart should literally be there on his sleeve. The earnest simplicity of Tony has been taken for granted, and this feels like a major miscast when it comes to making sure the emotional foundations of this towering story are there, set deep in the ground.</p>
<p>The songs are all delivered with ample conviction and Rita Moreno steals the show as widowed Puerto Rican shop-owner who has taken errant Tony under her wing (her rendition of ‘Somewhere’ is the film’s highpoint.) Yet it’s a strange thing to say about one of the world’s foremost forgers of cinematic imagery and sveltely assured storytelling, but on this evidence, Spielberg has no feel for musicals. He appears resistant to just showing the actors performing – placing bodies in the frame and painting with people. There’s a cloying need to make himself, the director, feel at every moment. The individual performances are all fine, but there’s no dynamism and connectivity.</p>
<p>And yet the brash, overly pronounced delivery of the dialogue – as if it’s being shouted for those in the cheap seats – dents the social realist air that Spielberg is attempting to cultivate through his ultra-detailed vintage production design and ungainly foregrounding of the story’s political subtexts. At one minute it feels like a music video, the next it’s as if the director is desperate to hold the attention of a fidgety audience through overly choreographed set-pieces for numbers which – as we saw in Robert Wise’s superior 1961 film – can simply soar on the wings of the songs and the performances.</p>
<p>It’s a rare, backwards looking misfire for this director who has always been at the vanguard of cinematic innovation. The care and attention that has gone into the making of this film is undeniable, though at times it feels misplaced and others overwrought. The story is so baked into the collective consciousness that this does feel like we’re going through the motions by the final act. And as the final credits roll, the “why” of Spielberg’s West Side Story is as unclear as it was when news of its conception first hit the trades.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>A</span>ri Wegner is fast becoming one of the most exciting cinematographers around. From William Oldroyd’s <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/lady-macbeth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lady Macbeth</a> and Peter Strickland’s <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/in-fabric/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Fabric</a> to Janicza Bravo’s <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/zola/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zola</a> and Jane Campion’s <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/the-power-of-the-dog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Power of the Dog</a>, her work is highly imaginative, varied and always evolving. We’ll next see her behind the camera for Sebastián Lelio’s The Wonder and Oldroyd’s second feature, but before then she spoke to us about the The Power of the Dog.</p>
<h3>On beginning a new project</h3>
<p>“I really like to start afresh on each film and take the lessons from the last project but not take any of the visual ideas or rules or approaches. I really try and start completely fresh with the script and the director, completely open-minded to what they&#8217;re thinking and I&#8217;m imagining. I love variety and I really love morphing the way I work to suit how a director wants to work because I really believe that the way a director works is so specific to them. How a director likes to work infuses into the film and I really enjoy as I&#8217;m getting to know someone beginning to understand not only how they want the film to look, but how they want the shoot to look. In many ways, I feel the DoP is an advocate for that because it&#8217;s not a given that a film shoot will morph to how a director wants to work.”</p>
<h3>On working with Jane Campion</h3>
<p>“I&#8217;d met Jane previously when we worked on a really short commercial together, so when she called me we knew each other but not that well. The first thing she said was that she&#8217;d read this book, and that she was adapting it into a screenplay, and would I be interested in talking about it. The main thing she wanted was a DP that was going to be available throughout the next year, and I didn&#8217;t know what form that would take, whether it would be a couple of conversations or something more. But the first thing I did was read the book, and I completely fell in love with it. That was before I&#8217;d even read Jane&#8217;s screenplay.</p>
<p>“The first thing she wanted to do was get out on the road and find the location, because she really knew the place had to work and had to work as for real as possible, without cheating too much. That said we were looking in New Zealand for a farm that was supposed to be in Montana, but we wanted to find something that would evoke the spirit of what you feel in the book, but also had a mountain range that felt powerful and iconic. Our first conversations were in the back of a van, between me, Jane and Grant Major the production designer, just driving around for days looking at different properties. Jane&#8217;s a great explorer, so there&#8217;s a lot of ‘Ooh, let&#8217;s go down that road, that looks cool!&#8217; and jumping out, walking up hills.”</p>
</div>

        <div class="text__block"><h3>On finding the film’s visual identity</h3>
<p>“After we found the place, we dove into what the challenges would be. I really love that about Jane because I can be a terrible procrastinator. Everyone’s natural instinct to start with the thing that will be the most fun, and ignore the things that will be harder or more daunting. One of the first things we talked about was ‘The Dog’ and the town of Beech; the two biggest worries from the visual effects side. The next scary thing was cattle. Jane’s quite an outdoorsy person, she grew up around horses and cattle, so she has some kind of idea that when the scene says ‘thousands of cattle go over the ridge’ it’s easier said than done. One of the other things I learned about Jane is that she really gets excited about things she doesn&#8217;t know. She&#8217;s very confident in saying ‘I don&#8217;t know’ and finding experts to give us the information.</p>
<p>“Then we started talking about colour, which was another big conversation. The great thing about having a year of pre-production was that we could sleep on something for a month and really mull it over, think about the best choice, get more information. We explored every possible option, we looked at black-and-white, we looked at more Technicolour intensity, trying to do a hand-coloured look, and made a variety of different palettes of colour approaches with old photos and paintings and postcards. We were drawn to this palette I’d probably call ‘dusty’ – the colour of the grass, the cattle, the timber of the buildings. Those sun-bleached colours, with the idea that Rose would stand out with her pastel pinks and yellows.”</p>
<h3>On working in widescreen</h3>
<p>“We thought about 16:9, because as much as Jane is a romantic she’s also a realist and knows that so many people enjoy watching things at home. We explored whether we should make it the perfect shape for the home experience, or go more 4:3, do something totally unexpected for a film set in such a vast landscape. Then we started doing storyboards, and as Jane was drawing she kept going off the edges of the rectangular board templates. Eventually, we realised this film really wanted to be widescreen. We did think about the fact it would have a home on a streaming service, but I think people are open to a cinematic experience at home.”</p>
</div>

        <div class="text__block"><h3>On the interior language of the film</h3>
<p>“In many ways it’s like a monster movie. We wanted the audience – and Rose and Peter – to be constantly aware of Phil’s presence, and thinking about where he is. What they&#8217;re going through, it&#8217;s never gonna end – it&#8217;s their life now. They&#8217;ve entered into this world. On the surface there&#8217;s visual elements of the western, but as a film I don&#8217;t think it quite fits, just because the typical themes of the western were not so much things that we were interested in. In westerns, the danger often comes from the outside, whether it’s the sheriff or the outlaw or someone that wants your land. In our film the danger comes from within the family unit, within the house. Nowhere is safe. We kept the house quite dark, so there’s a feeling Phil could be around any corner. For example, we knew we wanted it so that from Phil’s room you can see the piano, like that kind of visual connection. There’s so many doors everywhere in the house, but it’s impossible to feel really safe there.”</p>
<h3>On working with cattle</h3>
<p>“There was no getting around the cattle. Some of the guys who play cowboys in the film were real ranchers: there was one guy Jane met at a rodeo in Montana; another who works in Northern Queensland where there’s a lot of cattle. We had to get some people who were really comfortable being on a horse surrounded by cattle. You can’t act that kind of confidence. Cattle are interesting because they’re a prey animal – they’re a big animal that’s quite afraid, which makes them hard to train. But they&#8217;re also very curious, and when they&#8217;re calm they&#8217;re really cute.</p>
<p>“It took a lot of planning. Like, how many times do you need to see a lot of cattle to believe and understand that this is what this family does? And what tone and atmosphere do you want that scene to create? In the first scene with the cattle being taken to Beech, we were trying to create a sense of place and scale, as well as a sense of time passing. But the actual through line is Phil trying to get George&#8217;s attention; the cattle are sort of a background excuse for one brother to try and elicit some nostalgic thoughts from the other.</p>
<p>“Then there’s the scene with the castration. It’s really about emasculation and domination, and it’s no coincidence it happens just before Peter arrives at the ranch. It&#8217;s a real moment of male-on-male violence, and foreshadows this idea of the space not being big enough for more than one male presence. We had a great visual effects supervisor too, Jay Hawkins, who we worked with very closely to understand to what extent we could do digital cows, never as the main event but as an addition. There&#8217;s actually a lot of real cows, but then a lot of cow clones. You can’t see them! I’ve even forgotten which cows are what.”</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Justin Chon’s melodramatic tale of immigration and injustice in present-day America is undermined by a clichéd script.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>T</span>here’s no doubt that the subject matter at the heart of Justin Chon’s Blue Bayou is compelling and prescient – it focuses on the injustice of foreign-born adoptees in the United States being deported due to a legal loophole as a result of the Child Citizenship Act of 2000.</p>
<p>Despite having spent the majority of their lives in America with no family or life in their native country (and potentially having endured abuse at the hands of their adoptive families) these people are forced to endure lengthy and expensive legal battles, else accept deportation.</p>
<p>For Antonio LeBlanc (played by Chon) this means leaving behind his pregnant wife Kathy (Alicia Vikander), adoptive daughter Jessie (Sydney Kowalske) and his job as a tattoo artist, after the immigration department rule he must leave America for his native South Korea – a country Antonio has no relationship with.</p>
<p>Chon gives a strong performance as Antonio, and the supporting players are equally charming, but the script is weak and often clichéd, featuring a tangle of subplots which don’t quite mesh. Advocacy group Adoptees for Justice claim Blue Bayou utilises real-life stories without consent and have called for an apology from the director who’s heart appears to be in the right place by highlighting this devastating issue of displaced adoptees.</p>
<p>But his execution is heavy-handed, with the ending steering into a mawkish spectacle which undercuts the seriousness of the topic at hand.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>This anthology film from director Mohammad Rasoulof explores the social consequences of Iran’s death penalty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>U</span>nfolding across four divergent stories, Mohammad Rasoulof’s Golden Bear-winning anthology film There is No Evil presents a potent tapestry of perspectives informed by capital punishment in present-day Iran. Rather than being caught between poetry and censorship, Rasoulof strays from the stronghold of allegorical aesthetics and instead adopts a necessary and uncompromising antagonism against governmental oppression with fearless narrative urgency.</p>
<p>Each short is emotionally draining in its portrayal of the personal responsibility of executioners against a backdrop of authoritarian rule. Depictions of complex family dynamics, mandatory military conscription and corrupt state practices work in tandem to create a textured understanding of violence and its banality, of its immersion in the quotidian and the mundane.</p>
<p>The first two vignettes are captivating and thrilling, making the chest tighten with anxiety, while the didactic dialogue of the third and fourth shorts falter in focus and tonally complicate the whole. Despite an excessive 150-minute runtime, a fair share of abrupt tonal shifts and a somewhat heavy-handed execution of metaphors threatening to rob the anthology of power and cohesion, the dramatically consistent depictions of contempt, grief and rage bring an adequate sense of uniformity.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Paolo Sorrentino bares his soul in this autobiographical coming-of-age story about teenage obsessions.</p>
<p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/the-hand-of-god/">The Hand of God</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://lwlies.com">Little White Lies</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>P</span>aolo Sorrentino loves breasts. This is striking to anyone who has watched <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/the-great-beauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Great Beauty</a>, <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/youth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Youth</a> or <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/loro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Loro</a>, in which naked female flesh is as integral to his set decoration as whooshing dolly shots are to his cinematic language.</p>
<p>Among other things, The Hand of God is the story of the patient zero of boobs, which belong to Patrizia (Luisa Ranieri) aunt to the Chalamet-esque protagonist, Fabietto Schisa (Filippo Scotti). This Naples-set coming-of-age story is a portrait of the artist Sorrentino as a young man, before and after a tragedy of worst-possible-nightmare-so-couldn’t-really-happen proportions replaces boisterous family life with a lonelier path.</p>
<p>We’re introduced to the sprawl of the Schisa family through Patrizia one night as she waits in a long queue for the bus that’s never coming while wearing a white strappy dress – braless, naturally. A limo creeps up beside her, containing a strange old man who knows all about her and whisks her away to see ‘the little monk’, a local urban legend who can, apparently, make dreams come true.</p>
<p>As a result of this unexpected detour, Patrizia is late home and her husband flies off the handle. Cut to Fabietto on a scooter with mum Maria (Teresa Saponangelo) and dad Saveria (Toni Servillo), roaring through the night, cracking jokes.</p>
</div>


        <img src="https://lwlies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/the-hand-of-god-900x0-c-default.jpg" class="flex-fullWidthImage" />


        <div class="text__block"><p>Theirs is a bubble of good vibes despite being en route to a scene of domestic violence. Saponangelo and Servillo cause mini lightning storms of delight for every moment they’re on screen, even in scenes that are otherwise hard to parse. Completing the family is older brother Marchino (Marlon Joubert), an aspiring actor who loses his ambition after Fellini – whose presence looms large off-screen – tells him he looks like a waiter from Amarcuri.</p>
<p>Like the sport played by the icon hanging over its title, The Hand of God is a game of two halves. In the first, there is rarely a quiet moment in vignettes that span Maria’s incorrigible appetite for pranks, brotherly bonding, such as Marchino asking Fabietto to choose between having sex with Patrizia and Maradona being signed by Naples and – more weightily – the discovery of an affair. An extended family is drawn crassly, with Sorrentino othering physical difference, reaching for cheap jokes that are clearly inspired by Fellini, and yet Fellini himself could not have carried them off in today’s world.</p>
<p>Still, the dynamic of the central four is a pleasure incarnate. Equal parts funny and warm, each actor brings a specific dynamism that, when combined with the rest, crackles with life and love. Time passes like a rippling summer breeze in a mode that does not quite equal the cinema of Mia Hansen-Løve but is comparable to the way she makes forward momentum feel like a delicate pleasure. Then comes the transformative incident. The film quietens down and in Fabietto’s words, “I don’t like reality any more.”</p>
<p>The Hand of God is the autobiographical origin story of a filmmaker that exudes the warm intimacy that such personal storytelling enables. It’s this intimacy that coaxes audiences in-the-know to be forgiving over gauche streaks, such as Sorrentino’s view of female flesh as either sleekly pornographic or ridiculously grotesque.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>W</span>ith most film festivals celebrating the long-awaited return to in-person screenings, <a href="https://artekinofestival.arte.tv/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ArteKino</a> remains a torchbearer for virtual viewing. The festival takes a love for cinema and opens it up to the European public – with no advance Covid tests required – by offering another edition of robust programming to discover.</p>
<p>Europe-based audiences with the inclination to seek out exciting new films and catch the hot new auteurs before they’ve exploded onto the scene have a selection of 12 features to choose from in the 2021 ArteKino line-up: from festival favourites to unsung gems that, despite critical success garnered at festivals, haven’t had the ease of finding distribution in movie theatres.</p>
<p>From 1-31 December, viewers across 32 European countries, including the UK, can explore the selection in six close caption languages (French, German, English, Spanish, Italian, Polish) accessible through arte.tv and ARTE Cinéma on YouTube. Being entirely free and unequivocally promoting participation, viewership lies at the heart of this collaboration between cultural programming channel ARTE and screening platform Festival Scope, giving viewers the chance to vote for our favourite film to win the ArteKino Audience Award. So all there is left to ask is, what does this year’s programme have in store?</p>
<p>The curated selection combines poetry and politics, subjectivity and authenticity, innocence, loneliness and struggle for survival, offering a snapshot of the eclectic spirit at the core of contemporary European cinema.</p>
<p>Gender and hardship are central to this year’s thematic undertakings. Call Me Marianna is Karolina Bielwka’s first feature-length documentary, and it swept four awards at Krakow before winning the Zonta Club Prize at Locarno. We enter the private sphere of a 40 year old Polish trans woman who has legally had to sue her parents in order to pursue sex reassignment surgery. The film expresses the turmoil of being trapped in a prison of flesh that doesn’t feel yours, as much as the solace that gender affirming surgery can offer to a trans person living in Poland.</p>
<p>Another emotional documentary on women whose courage doesn’t waver lies in Masha Kondakova’s documentary Inner Wars, which takes the filmmaker directly into a warzone. The ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia is presented through the eyes of three Ukrainian women on the frontline who are also consistently fighting on the front against patriarchal standards and the media’s caricatured representations of women in the army.</p>
<p>An unexpected relationship forms the basis of Nathalie Biancheri’s kitchen-sink drama Nocturnal, in which an emotionally stunted yet sensitive brute in his 30s forms a precarious friendship with a 17-year-old student, providing a compelling portrait of flawed masculinity and a remarkable performance by British actor Cosmo Jarvis. In Süheyla Schwenk’s Jiyan, a similar unlikely relationship develops between a young mother and her aunt-in-law, after a young couple moves from Syria to Berlin to provide a better life for their unborn child.</p>
</div>


        <img src="https://lwlies.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nocturnal-900x0-c-default.jpg" class="flex-fullWidthImage" />


        <div class="text__block"><p>With an intimate portrait of her brother and mother, Paloma Sermon-Daï’s Petit Samedi looks at a painful relationship with addiction and dependence which intertwines the personal and familial. A family living in the idyllic Southern Italian countryside, where Sara Summa’s The Last to See Them takes place, lives its last moments of quotidian simplicity with an overarching sense of foreboding. Maternal love and its shifting meanings are also explored in Jonas Bak’s atmospheric Wood and Water, a psychological investigation of a woman who, upon entering retirement, abandons her solitary life in rural Germany to travel to protest-ridden Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Political critique frames the hybrid doc Uppercase Print, a 2020 Berlinale favourite by prolific director Radu Jude. A forgotten piece of Ukranian history is dramatised through the theatrical conceptualisation of a Romanian teenager’s protest against the dictatorship of Ceausescu. Theatrical reconstruction is juxtaposed with archival footage and looks at state surveillance, the banality of dictatorship, and the vitality of Romanian youth.</p>
<p>Astute explorations of adolescence are to be found in LOMO: The Language of Many Others by Julia Langhof, a portrait of online coming of age and computerised teenage angst, as well as Ivan Ikić’s Oasis, where an unanticipated love triangle forms between three teenagers navigating feelings of desire and envy in a special needs institution. Blossoming teen friendships in the suburbs of Zurich is Karin Heberlein’s contribution to coming of age with Sami, Joe and I, while Marysia Nikitiuk’s tactful portrayal of innocence, fragmented identity and tragic romance in When the Trees Fall, looks at rural Ukraine through a lens of magical realism.</p>
<p>As you can see from this line-up, this is a selection of engaged and engaging works which seeks to explore the trials, tribulations and traumas of contemporary Europe. Watch them all and vote for the one which speaks to you the loudest.</p>
<p><em><strong>ArteKino 2021 runs from 1 to 30 December. For more info visit <a href="https://artekinofestival.arte.tv/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">artekinofestival.arte.tv</a></strong></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>F</span>rom the turbulent adolescence of Thumbsucker through to the found family of <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/20th-century-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20th Century Women</a>, Mike Mills creates thoughtful portraits of complex relationships. The same goes for his fourth feature, <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/cmon-cmon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">C’mon C’mon</a>, in which radio host Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) forms a bond with his nine-year-old nephew Jesse (Woody Norman) after family strife brings them together.</p>
<p><strong>LWLies: <a href="https://lwlies.com/reviews/beginners/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beginners</a> and 20th Century Women are very much rooted in your familial experiences. Is the same true of C’mon C’mon?</strong></p>
<p>Mills: It definitely started with my kid, Hopper. There’s lots of scenes of things that happened between me and my kid, but it’s a little different this time as it’s the first time I’m dealing with someone who’s alive, and someone who’s a child. I had to find a way to create distance, like the uncle part of the story, and the idea that Johnny and Jesse don’t really know one another. But there are nuggets that are very much my kid.</p>
<p>The weird, spiritual craziness of writing means you’re not in control of what’s happening and things are coming and you don’t know exactly why. The way I work with actors, I need them to make it theirs. So I’m doing everything I can do give it to them. Woody is not my kid, but there’s something beautiful about that exchange, with him bringing his soul and psyche and history and timing and humour. Taking my version of my own kid and running with it.</p>
<p><strong>How did Hopper react when you explained you were going to make a film about your relationship?</strong></p>
<p>My kid never met my parents and hasn’t seen any of my films. They consider me and my kid’s mom [Miranda July] to be pretty good filmmakers, but Wes Anderson – there’s a <em>real</em> director. At some point I told them about my parents and those films, and I said something like, ‘A human being is a crazy, complicated, fluid, ever-changing, multi-layered, contradictory cosmos,’ and in each of those films, if I can get just one slice of them, I’m really lucky. But it’s just a slice. There’s so much more going on. When I told Hopper, I said, ‘I’m thinking of making a film that starts with us,’ and they said, ‘You mean like when a person is really huge, like a cosmos, and you only get a slice?’ So Hopper completely understands what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>It must be nice for Hopper to have this film to come back to when they&#8217;re older and see this version of them.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s as much Woody as it is Hopper, but who knows&#8230; You know the whole story of Christopher Robin and his Dad?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>Christopher Robin hated his father, hated all the Winnie the Pooh books. He thought that they stole his likeness, his name and his childhood. He never wanted anything to do with them, didn’t want to talk to his dad, all that. So that’s my huge fear, that something like that happens. I hope Hopper doesn’t care too much. I hope they understand the love that was there, and how much I adored my time with them. But I also hope they’re their own filmmaker, and think, ‘Dad, you were cute, but I’m making much better films now.’ That&#8217;s the goal.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned a moment ago the collaborative process between you and your actors being integral to your films. How early did the cast come into the creative process this time?</strong></p>
<p>I wrote the whole script, and I thought I was done, but I&#8217;m never really done. I&#8217;m always hunting for a way to make it better. I wanted Joaquin, but you can&#8217;t think you&#8217;re going to get Joaquin. I have friends who have worked with him, I know from Spike [Jonze] how difficult it was to get Joaquin. So we met and he very nicely told me he couldn’t figure out how to do it justice; therefore, no. And I just completely fell in love with him. Luckily, he was interested in the terrain. I kept him engaged, and we just kind of hit it off. I think we made each other laugh, it’s as simple as that.</p>
<p>Eventually, he was sitting here in my house, and we were reading through the script over and over again, with me acting out all the other parts. Totally intimidating. But we would experientially feel it through, and one of us would have a question every few inches of text. We just kept working on it, questioning everything. That was rad. I didn’t do that so much with Gaby [Hoffman], because by the time she came on board I’d done it so much with Joaquin. But Gaby and Joaquin were my first choices. I’ve loved their work for many years and never knew either one of them, so it was a sweet thing.</p>

        <blockquote>
	&ldquo;To me, remembering is one of the more precious human behaviours. And remembering something together – that’s love.&rdquo;

    </blockquote>


        <div class="text__block"><p><strong>There’s this incredible intelligence and warmth but also world-weariness to Woody Norman’s performance. You really understand him as a fully-fledged human being. It&#8217;s like watching a 40-year-old in the body of a nine-year-old.</strong></p>
<p>You described that really nicely; that’s what it feels like to be with my kid, and a lot of other kids, as an adult person. Developmentally they&#8217;re different, but they&#8217;re not less than. That&#8217;s one of the themes of the film, with the other kids we interview and with Woody&#8217;s character. The premise of the film is growing enough to treat children as completely valid and legitimate and equal. I think our culture does so many things to make that not so; we make kids cute, we make kids dumb, we make kids simple. And they’re not any of those things.</p>
<p><strong>C’mon C’mon is so much about families wanting to understand each other, and be seen and heard by each other. A lot of that is in the film’s sound design, too, and the fact we’re constantly being asked to listen to the city, to take a breath and just be present.</strong></p>
<p>It’s just sound, but space, too. I love the Wim Wenders film Alice in the Cities, and there&#8217;s a lot of space in that film. A big hero for me is Erik Satie, I love his piano pieces – to be able to walk between the notes and not be sort of domineered by the music. I’m trying to do Satie moves at all times. There’s this film by [Ermanno] Olmi, The Fiances, which is amazing. There’s no tense ropes in that movie. Everything’s kind of relaxed, like a fabric. It’s part of the editing, part of the sound; wanting to hear real things. My sound mixer, Zach Seivers, has a gentle touch and is a real naturalist. There’s actually more sound added in this movie than in my last two movies combined.</p>
<p><strong>And you worked with Aaron and Bryce Dessner again, after collaborating on The National’s ‘I Am Easy to Find’.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, luckily they’re very patient, because it is a long process. You know, in some ways I think they understood the film better than I did. The gentleness and the heart. I was trying to move it to do other things and they were like, ‘You can relax, Mike, you can have it be this very gentle, minimal thing.’ When I hear it now I feel like I’m hearing the sound of Johnny and Jesse together. The sound of their relationship. Emotions and sound are really interrelated.</p>
<p><strong>What insight did going to these locations and meeting all these kids give you into how it is to be young in America at the present moment?</strong></p>
<p>In the film you hear one thing from each kid, but we did a 40-minute interview with each of them, so it’s just the tip of each iceberg. Sometimes it’s kind of misleading&#8230; The girl in New Orleans who says she wishes she could change her anger, it’s kind of a funny moment, but what she’s angry about in real life is incredibly tragic and intense. We did those interviews almost every day throughout the shoot. We started off with a list of questions, but the conversation always took its own turns. Film production is often ‘Go go go! Get get get!’ but this was not that – it was practising ‘being’.</p>
<p><strong>There’s a really beautiful moment towards the end of the film where Jesse says to Johnny, ‘Am I gonna remember any of this?’ Do you think every film you make is an act of self-preservation?</strong></p>
<p>Hell the fuck yes. To me, remembering is one of the more precious human behaviours. And then remembering something together – that’s love. It’s as intimate and meaningful as it gets. Because memory is fucked up. It’s not a fact. It’s very fragile and fluid, and a lot of my films come from memory, so I spend a lot of time trying to remember. But the more you try to remember the more it goes away. All my films are me communing with someone I really love, who really confuses me, and is a real mystery. I’m trying to understand them a little bit better. It’s presenting a version of myself to a person I love, and trying to hold them with my best self.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="post__content">

        <div class="text__block"><p><span class='dropCap'>T</span>his weekend, the BFI Southbank will host <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=bustingthebias&amp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Busting the Bias</a>, a series of screenings, talks and presentations showcasing Disabled practitioners’ work. The programme aims to create ongoing discourse for improved access for Disabled talent to work in the screen industries, and advocate for authentic on-screen representation and leadership off-screen. All screenings will be presented with subtitles for the D/deaf and people experiencing hearing loss.</p>
<p>Love, directed by Jane Ashmore and starring Jules Robertson, is a great example of what can happen when the industry eschews ‘cripping up’ (where disabled parts are played by non disabled actors) and you get a sense of the lived experience the actor can bring to the role. This bittersweet film tells the story of Oscar, a complex character with unique needs but the same hopes and desires as anyone. The ‘straight’ manner in which Oscar’s lines are delivered might seem comedic to a person that does not have autism, but they are not meant as such – in this sense the film accurately conveys the way autism is often misinterpreted.</p>
</div>


        <img src="https://lwlies.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/the-multi-900x0-c-default.jpg" class="flex-fullWidthImage" />


        <div class="text__block"><p>Next up is The Multi, a short film that tackles how a Black woman uses the order in her life to hide the trauma that was inflicted on her by her father during childhood. This trauma rears its head when her sister’s wedding has to relocate to her father’s house due to the pandemic. Chats over Zoom with her sister about her upcoming wedding capture the loneliness and isolation that comes from your office space being the same as your personal space. The film was made semi-remotely with a majority d/Deaf cast and crew. The standout performer is Natasha Ofili, who also wrote and produced the film.</p>
<p>Another film that was made remotely is Aimee Victoria, a deaf queer love story made during the height of lockdown in 2020. It poses the question that many of us have asked since March last year – how do you celebrate special occasions virtually? For this reason, the film really strikes an emotional chord. The answer for Aimee is to create a beautiful poem for her girlfriend, Victoria, which she performs for her as she stands on her balcony, like a modern-day deaf queer version of ‘Romeo and Juliet’.</p>
<p>These films are free from the stereotypes of disabled people that you often see on screen – we are to be pitied, to be feared, to be reduced to our disabilities like caricatures. We are complex people with our own flaws, desires and hopes, and these films portray us as such. As someone who is passionate about accurate representation of disabled people in film and media, Busting the Bias feels like a real game-changer.</p>
