But let&#39;s get it out of the way.</p><p>When I was getting married to my amazing wife, Jamie, it really was the best day of my life, don&#39;t get me wrong.</p><p>But the thing is, I actually left the wedding a little bit early.</p><p>I left to go play football … <em>really</em>.</p><p>There’s more to it than that (promise), but I’m telling you because I want you to understand just what playing for the England powerchair football team means to me. </p><blockquote>But the thing is, I actually left the wedding a little bit early. I left to go play football … really.<cite>Jon Bolding</cite></blockquote><p>So first, I think we have to go back a bit to give you some context. Let’s go right back to the beginning, in fact.</p><p>Baby Jonathan Bolding was born on the 14th of October, 1987, to my parents, Jon and Sue. I was the youngest in a family that already had three girls. Everyone was delighted.</p><p>Except, soon they realised that something was not quite right with this baby. </p><p>After two years, my parents got the three words that made their world crumble: central core myopathy. I had been diagnosed with a rare condition that meant my muscles didn’t grow at the rate of your average person’s. </p><p>The doctors told my parents that because the condition mainly affects my legs, my muscles wouldn’t ever ever be strong enough to keep my body weight up.</p><p>In other words, they said I wouldn’t ever be able to walk.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fnyda638avn0aamagt.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Tommy Milanese/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Tommy Milanese/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>But my parents being my parents, they simply didn’t accept that. They understood the seriousness of the condition, of course, but they are fighters, strong-minded and full of love. Basically, they are the sort of people that aren’t good at taking no for an answer — haha!</p><p>From the age of just two, they got me a pair of calipers that locked my legs into place. The result wasn’t perfect — I moved like a penguin, from side to side — but the calipers kept me up. I could <em>walk</em>. </p><p>From the first diagnosis, my parents kept setting objectives to make sure their son had the best possible chance in life to do and enjoy everything just like any other kid. And one thing my dad in particular didn’t want me to miss out on was football. </p><p>Through him I quickly became a football obsessive, and later I even converted him from a Brentford into an Arsenal fan. We would go to games together but, of course, more than anything, I wanted to <em>play</em>.</p><blockquote>I couldn’t run. I couldn’t jump. I couldn’t tackle. I could barely kick the ball.<cite>Jon Bolding</cite></blockquote><p>So, my dad took me down to Wimbledon, where they had a disability football team that met up for training sessions once a week and the odd friendly tournament at the weekends.</p><p>If you can imagine these sessions, there were people with all kinds of disabilities and conditions. At one end of the spectrum, there were lads who were missing an arm but who are still very good with their feet … and then, at the other end, there was me with my big metal calipers.</p><p>I couldn’t run. I couldn’t jump. I couldn’t tackle. I could barely kick the ball.</p><p>I was basically just an on-pitch spectator as the games happened around me, hoping for a pass that came <em>directly</em> to my feet.</p><p>If you ask my parents now, they’ll tell you it was properly heartbreaking for them to see their son like that. But they kept on taking me down to Wimbledon because it was <em>football</em> and I loved it. And, for a while, I never imagined it could get any better than that.</p><p>As I got older, the curve in my spine I’d had since birth got worse. This is not uncommon for people with disabilities like mine, but the curve was getting so bad that by the point I was 13, my parents had a decision to make.</p><blockquote>I technically died for a minute or so on the operating table.<cite>Jon Bolding</cite></blockquote><p>Without an operation, I risked getting worse to the point where I might become fully wheelchair-bound and my lungs could eventually be crushed. </p><p>But, an operation this serious was <em>a lot</em> for a 13-year-old, especially one with weak muscles and asthma. Let’s just say, it was no sure thing I would make it out alive. Even if it was a success, my movement was likely to be further restricted.</p><p>I didn’t really understand the magnitude of the situation at the time. How could I? I was barely a teenager. But the doctors laid out all the pros and cons to my parents. And in the end, the curve was getting so bad that my parents chose to operate.</p><p>(Just FYI, anyone squeamish might want to skip the next few paragraphs.)</p><p>Basically, the operation to fix the curve involved having two metal rods placed on either side of my spine. </p><p>How it works is that they take the disks out of the spine and allow it to go all floppy, and then they fuse the spine to these rods. </p><p>So, the surgeons had to go in through my side, break one of my ribs and deflate my lungs, in order to get to the spine to take the disks out. </p><p>And then a week later, they would then go back in for a second surgery to fuse the rods. </p><p>On top of all that, the really scary part was I actually had an allergic reaction to the anesthesia, and I <em>technically</em> died for a minute or so on the operating table. All I remember is I was getting very hot and flustered and then all of a sudden I passed out. When I regained consciousness, I had this <em>massive</em> needle in my neck. Haha!</p><p>(O.K., squeamish people can come back now.)</p><p>After the operation, I spent three weeks in the hospital and I was off school for over six months (which was great as a teenager). For the whole time, I had to wear this weird kind of plastic body-suit thing (less great) to make sure that nothing came out of place. I remember that summer was one of the hottest on record and there I am in this plastic sweatbox for seven or eight hours a day! </p><p>But what kept me going throughout it all was the thought of powerchair football.</p><p>You see, not long before my operation, I had spotted something randomly on a table at school. It was a leaflet:</p><p>POWERCHAIR FOOTBALL TOURNAMENT. </p><p>I’d never heard of “powerchair” before and had no idea of the rules. My dad had taken me to try wheelchair basketball before, but I didn’t have the upper-body strength. This was essentially football, but played by knocking the ball about with your chair. </p><blockquote>I was actually playing football. And yeah — wow — I was actually good at it.<cite>Jon Bolding</cite></blockquote><p>In order to make the modifications I needed, my dad ended up cutting up a car tire and tying half of it to the front of my NHS-issue chair with string to act as a bumper. (Fortunately, my chairs have gotten a little more sophisticated since then!)</p><p>Once there, on the basketball court at the rehabilitation centre with all the other players, one of the first things that struck me was that I’d never really been around so many disabled people in one place before. There were a couple of people at my school, and obviously I’d played at Wimbledon, but this felt <em>different</em>. It was like we were all the same, on a level playing field. I met people that day that have remained my friends ever since.</p><p>The rules were pretty simple — no huddling, only one-on-one tackles allowed, etc. — but the idea was mainly just to have fun and get a feel for the sport.</p><p>My team won the tournament and I scored a few goals. It was the first time in my life that I’d felt like the person who could be the dribbler, the creator, the goal scorer. Forget standing around awkwardly at Wimbledon, I was actually <em>playing</em> football. </p><p>And yeah — wow — I was actually good at it.</p><p>Two or three weeks after that first experience, my parents got a call from someone at Middlesex FA. She explained that they had seen my potential that day and wanted to know if I’d be interested in taking part in a trip they were putting together to send a team of powerchair players to play a few friendlies … in Japan.</p><p><em>JAPAN</em>.</p><p>This was <em>major</em>. I’d only played one tournament as a 13-year-old and now this! You better believe I told <em>everyone</em> I knew that I’d been selected to go over to <em>Japan</em> to play football — hahaha!</p><p>I still remember that trip like it was yesterday. It was the first time I’d been away from my parents and I was traveling halfway around the world to <em>represent my country </em>… O.K., it wasn’t “official” England duty, but to me it was as good as! And the best bit came right before our first game, when we got handed a bag of England shirts to play in. As I say, this wasn’t officially sanctioned, we just needed team kits that differentiated us from the opposition. (And I think these ones had been donated to charity — they were a mismatch of different years and styles.)</p><p>I got a shirt from the 2002 World Cup, if you remember that one? With the single red line down one side? </p><p>And on the back of that shirt? </p><p>8. </p><p>Gerrard. Lampard. <em>Bolding</em>. </p><p>It’s been my number ever since. I have this hope that maybe someday someone else will pick number 8 because it’s Jon Bolding’s number.</p><blockquote>We get to wear the white kit. That official white kit. The same kit that Harry Kane and Steph Houghton pull on.<cite>Jon Bolding</cite></blockquote><p>From that experience, powerchair quickly took over my life. It gave me a new set of objectives. A new purpose.</p><p>I played every opportunity I could. I learned everything about the game and its quirks. </p><p>I picked up quickly that aside from bolts and pieces of your chair coming loose, the main thing to worry about is your battery. I’ve been caught out by forgetting to charge it the night before and it’s cost me! (These days, I use a manual chair for daily life and the electric one is for football only.)</p><p>I learned that inflatable tires are better for grip on the court and, personally, I prefer mine quite deflated for added control and movement.</p><p>In the early days, I learned that every country had its own rules, before we all got together in Atlanta and standardised them in 2006. France played with barriers at the side of the pitch (no throw-ins), while the Americans’ game was more like American football with blocking.</p><p>It’s an amazing sport and community that I’m proud to have helped build into what it is today.</p><p>Things really went to another level once the FA got involved in 2013. Up until that point, all our tournaments had been self-funded. We were representing England, but we had to raise money for travel and better chairs by ourselves.</p><p>Now, it’s more professional. We have funding and the same treatment as any other England team. We get caps, we play under the national anthem, and of course we get to wear the white kit. That <em>official</em> white kit. The same kit that Harry Kane and Steph Houghton pull on. It’s an honour and a responsibility I never could have imagined back when I was a teenager. It still gives me goose bumps, you know?</p><p>Now that you have some idea of just how much playing for England means to me, I can finally tell you about my wedding.</p><p>In 2012, I proposed to Jamie (the love of my life, who I met one drunken night in the old Liquid nightclub in Windsor haha) and we set a date for our wedding of July 18, 2014 — <em>specifically</em> avoiding the European championships that year, which were scheduled for spring time.</p><p>Then we get an announcement that the dates of the tournament are being changed. First game? You guessed it: July 18.</p><p>Damn.</p><p>The wedding was already booked and paid for, so Jamie and I had the conversation and it was like, “Well that sucks, but I <em>guess</em> I just can’t go to the Euros….”</p><p>But I kept training with the team in the lead-up to the tournament, and as it got closer and closer, the thoughts started creeping into my head like, <em>How can I miss this? This is everything I’ve ever dreamed of since that first trip to Japan. We’re going to play as England </em>officially<em>.</em></p><p>So, I wrote a long, awkward text to Jamie that went something like: “Babe, you know how much this sport means to me ... is there <em>something</em> that we can do to allow me to go play football? And, <em>of course</em>, this wedding means the world to us both ... it&#39;s just I <em>really</em> need to make this tournament.”</p><p>Long story short, it cost me one (very expensive) Mulberry handbag, <em>but</em> we agreed that I could do the wedding then rush off to the airport to join the rest of the team in Ireland for the tournament!</p><p>Throughout the wedding day, before and after the <em>I do’s</em>, I was glued to my phone checking the scores of the day’s games. (I mean, who needs memories when you&#39;ve got the wedding video anyway? — sorry, Jamie!).</p><p>At one in the morning, mid-party, I slipped off into the toilets to change from my suit into my England tracksuit before racing to Stansted with my dad for the flight the FA had booked me.</p><p>I didn’t drink the whole day, but fortunately Jamie was battered by the time I left and I don’t think she even knew I was gone in the end — haha. ;)</p><p>The very next day I was playing in the Euros. Just to be a part of that first tournament, to see BOLDING 8 on the back of an <em>official</em> England shirt … well, seeing that was worth the price of a handbag.</p><p>We made it to the final against France, and by Sunday night I was flying back and getting ready to go to New York on my honeymoon!</p><blockquote>I blamed myself for being disabled and putting my wife and unborn child in this position.<cite>Jon Bolding</cite></blockquote><p>To be honest, I probably don’t tell Jamie enough, but I couldn’t ask for a more amazing wife. She has supported me throughout everything and helped me live my dreams. Back when I was young, even before I discovered football, I set three goals for myself. <br/><br/>I was going to: get married, have a house of my own and become a father.</p><p>Thanks to Jamie, I completed those goals with the last one coming with the birth of my daughter, Halle, in 2015. </p><p>It is my proudest moment. That sounds like the obvious thing to say, but you have to understand that, because of my condition, it was 50-50 whether she would inherit the same disability.</p><p>During the early weeks of the pregnancy, waiting for the results of the screening test to find out whether the baby was like me or not was the worst week of my life.</p><p>I blamed myself for being disabled and putting my wife and unborn child in this position. I’m a positive person, I like to find upside in everything, but all the feelings I had growing up of, <em>why me?</em> before I found football, came rushing back.</p><p>Fortunately in the end, I’m pleased to say Halle took Jamie’s genes rather than mine. We&#39;ve got a very special one. </p><p>Since that first Euros under the FA in 2014, the wedding to Jamie and Halle’s birth, it’s been a whirlwind of incredible memories. </p><figure><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8AtQUHETm/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:16px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8AtQUHETm/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" background:#FFFFFF; line-height:0; padding:0 0; text-align:center; text-decoration:none; width:100%;" target="_blank"> <div style=" display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"> <div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display:block; height:50px; margin:0 auto 12px; width:50px;"></div><div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style=" color:#3897f0; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:550; line-height:18px;">View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding: 12.5% 0;"></div> <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; margin-bottom: 14px; align-items: center;"><div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(0px) translateY(7px);"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; height: 12.5px; transform: rotate(-45deg) translateX(3px) translateY(1px); width: 12.5px; flex-grow: 0; margin-right: 14px; margin-left: 2px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; height: 12.5px; width: 12.5px; transform: translateX(9px) translateY(-18px);"></div></div><div style="margin-left: 8px;"> <div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 20px; width: 20px;"></div> <div style=" width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 2px solid transparent; border-left: 6px solid #f4f4f4; border-bottom: 2px solid transparent; transform: translateX(16px) translateY(-4px) rotate(30deg)"></div></div><div style="margin-left: auto;"> <div style=" width: 0px; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-right: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(16px);"></div> <div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; flex-grow: 0; height: 12px; width: 16px; transform: translateY(-4px);"></div> <div style=" width: 0; height: 0; border-top: 8px solid #F4F4F4; border-left: 8px solid transparent; transform: translateY(-4px) translateX(8px);"></div></div></div> <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;"> <div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"></div> <div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;"></div></div></a><p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx8AtQUHETm/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Jon Bolding (@jbolding8)</a></p></div></blockquote></figure><script async defer src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script<p>We won the Euros in 2019, beating our old rivals France on penalties in the final after coming back from 2–0 down during normal time. I’ll never forget the madness after the last penalty — my dad literally jumped the barrier and was on top of me in seconds, crying haha!</p><p>Those things stay with you.</p><p>The way people celebrate at powerchair football, it’s not your standard clapping and cheering like at Sunday league. I think because of the way everyone involved is so invested in the sport, they just lose their minds like <em>out of their skin</em> celebrating. It’s madness in the best way. </p><p>I want more of that and I have plans to win the World Cup and Champions League — those are the only biggies missing from my medal collection. But I also want to keep helping to grow the game, help it get maximum coverage and more TV time. (Hey, if badminton can get airtime, then why not powerchair?!) </p><p>I also love that as an older player, I can be there for the community as someone who’s seen and done it all and can even provide advice to young players and parenting tips as a disabled man.</p><p>I’ve always said I’ll keep playing as long as my dad — who’s been coming along with me since the beginning and seen me from those tough times at Wimbledon up to becoming a European champion — is able to come. </p><p>And when I’m finally retired, I want to be able to pass down all my medals to Halle, watch her grow up and, someday, marry whoever treats her best.</p><p>That wedding will be very special to me.</p><p>And this time, I promise I won&#39;t leave early.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2898,h_1630,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fnyespyy65n7r9nxe6.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><hr /><p><em>To learn more about the opportunities to participate and play in disability football, visit </em><a href="http://englandfootball.com/footballyourway"><u><em><strong>englandfootball.com/footballyourway</strong></em></u></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><category>England</category></item><item><title>My Rock Bottom</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/jordan-poyer-buffalo-bills-nfl-football-alcoholism?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Jordan Poyer</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fjm7psbd9g</guid><description>Jordan Poyer opens up about alcoholism.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 15:14:22 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2500,h_1406,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fnhp5vj7qwcr2nkbm8.jpg" caption="Taylor Baucom/The Players&#39; Tribune"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Jordan Poyer"></flatplan:author><keywords>NFL,Buffalo Bills,football,Jordan Poyer </keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is not easy for me to do. </p><p>But I need to do it. </p><p>I need to do it for my daughter. For my wife. For my whole family. For my teammates. And most of all for myself. </p><p>I’m Jordan Poyer, captain of the Buffalo Bills, and I am an alcoholic. </p><p>Damn, you know what? It honestly feels good to say that. </p><p>A big part of my sobriety is to lean into the truth. To be comfortable with who I am. And I’m actually surprised by how easy it’s been to open up to people. I had built it up into this big thing in my mind. Even when I got sober and went to my first AA meeting back in March, I was so nervous that someone was going to recognize me that I didn’t even open my mouth. I just sat there listening the whole time, on the low. </p><p>But I slowly started to realize that truth was a kind of freedom. When I saw some of my Bills teammates for the first time over the summer, they had no idea that I was four months sober. </p><p>I’ll never forget, we were chilling, just catching up and everything, and some of the guys were drinking, and I just came right out and told them the deal. I said, “Look, I know y’all have seen me drunk as <em>hell</em> before. But I want you to know that I have a problem. And I’m taking the steps to address it. I’m not drinking anymore. So I hope everybody’s cool with that. I’m trying to be a better me.”  </p><p>And, man, I was so nervous to see how they’d react. I really thought they might bust out laughing, thinking I was messing with them — because they’ve seen me out at the club, getting <em>lit</em>-lit, you know what I’m saying? </p><p>But that wasn’t their reaction at all. Everybody just took it all in and immediately showed me 100% love and respect, no questions asked. I was blown away by their support and their brotherhood.

Just showed up in <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/collections/our-michigan" target="_blank">Ann Arbor</a>, without any clue what’s about to happen to me pretty much overnight.</p><p>Rich Rodriguez was the Michigan coach at the time, and the night before our opener against Western Michigan he walked the team over to the <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/michigan-football-the-big-house-from-where-i-see-it" target="_blank">stadium</a>.</p><p>“This is our house,” he said, after gathering us on the field. “It’s the greatest place in the world to play a football game. Look around. This is the place where you can make your dreams come true.”</p><p>As he spoke, I remember turning my head and looking at the bleachers from every angle I could, just kind of taking it all in. After a few seconds, Coach went on.</p><p>“I want each one of you to go find a seat somewhere. Pick out a place in this stadium, sit down, and just take a few minutes to envision yourself out on that field. Close your eyes and visualize yourself doing something special out there tomorrow.”</p><p>As soon as Coach finished speaking, I knew exactly where I was gonna go.</p><p>Some guys headed into the stands and sat down right away. First row, great view. Other players headed to the 50, and sat halfway up the bleachers, basically right in the middle of the field.</p><p>Me?</p><p>It was never even a question</p><p>I was headed straight to the top.</p><blockquote>The field was soooooo green. The lines and numbers on the turf were super bright. The bleachers seemed to go on forever. Everything was absolutely perfect.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>I stretched my legs for a second or two, and then I started to climb.</p><p>Ninety-eight rows later, I turned around and looked down….</p><p>It was the most beautiful sight I’d ever seen.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3504,h_1971,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn7nn321eq0zjbkq47.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Tom Pidgeon/Getty Images"><figcaption>Tom Pidgeon/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The field was <em>soooooo</em> green. The lines and numbers on the turf were super bright. The bleachers seemed to go on forever. Everything was absolutely perfect — like what a football field would look like in a dream, or in some movie.</p><p>After taking a few moments to look out over the wall at the top, I grabbed a seat and gathered my thoughts.</p><p>I felt like I’d had a solid training camp, and that even though I was just a freshman, maybe some people on the staff had taken notice. So, sitting there, I remember saying to myself, <em>If you somehow get a shot in the opener, be special. Do something amazing!</em></p><p>When I closed my eyes, I saw myself running past defenders, getting into the open field, and scoring a touchdown. It was as clear as day. Like I could actually see it happening right there in front of me.</p><p>My whole body felt like it had goose bumps.</p><p>Then, about 18 hours later, on the very first snap of my Michigan career, the first time I ever touched the ball, this happened….</p><hr /><p>Now, before I go any further, let me just say: I get why people ask the question.</p><p>I really do.</p><p>It doesn’t get me mad. I’m not bitter about it.</p><p>I understand.</p><p>A few years back, you couldn’t turn on your TV without seeing me make some crazy play like that run I had against Western.</p><p>That first touchdown in the Big House set it off, and then everything just kind of blew up from there. Huge games. Everyone watching. Tuning in to see what I might do. Notre Dame comeback No. 1. Notre Dame comeback No. 2 — with bonus points for it being under the lights at the Big House and going 80 yards in the last 30 seconds to win the game. Five total touchdowns in a win over that team down south. And on and on. Highlight after highlight. Stats for days.</p><p>At the grocery store, there I am, smiling back at you from the cover of a magazine. ESPN won’t shut up about my shoes being untied. Interview requests coming in from stations all over the country. It was like Denard Robinson overkill.   </p><p>At one point they even put me on the front of a video game. </p><p>I was pretty much everywhere you looked for a while there. And then, just a few years later, it was like….</p><p>Dude is nowhere to be found.</p><blockquote>I was pretty much everywhere you looked for a while there. And then, just a few years later, it was like…. Dude is nowhere to be found.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>So people started asking.</p><p>“Where’s Denard at?”</p><p>“What’s Denard doing these days?”</p><p>“Yo, what ever happened to Denard Robinson?”</p><p>And for me, hearing that, and knowing what I know, and having lived through both the extremes — the highs and the lows — when I hear it, I kind of just shake my head and chuckle at that. Because, it’s like….</p><p><em>What’s up with me?</em></p><p><em>What happened to Denard Robinson?</em></p><p>I mean, what can I tell you, man?</p><p>Life.</p><p>That’s what happened.</p><p>Life happened.</p><hr /><p>Back when I was at Michigan, people always told me that I made things look easy.</p><p>They’d come up to me and say that, and then talk about a specific run, or some game where I made four guys miss on a certain play.</p><p>“<em>Sooooo</em> smooth,” they’d say. “So easy.”</p><p>I’d hear it and just smile.</p><p>But the truth is, it wasn’t always as easy and seamless for me as it might have looked.</p><p>In fact, that first TD I had is a perfect example. On that one, not a lot of people know this but ... I actually forgot the play. </p><blockquote>I was so worried about getting everyone lined up properly and not messing up the snap count that I forgot what I was supposed to do.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>I was so worried about getting everyone lined up properly and not messing up the snap count that I forgot what I was supposed to do. And then, of course, I also forget to … actually <em>catch the snap</em>.</p><p>I wasn’t even supposed to keep the ball on that play. I was supposed to pitch it to a receiver on a reverse. But as soon as I dropped it, it was like: All bets are off. When I picked up the ball, in my head it was like: <em>You can’t let your first play at Michigan end like this. You’ll never see the field again</em>.</p><p>I basically had no choice but to score. I couldn’t mess up a play that bad, and then get chased down from behind by a DB or something.</p><p>It was score or go home.</p><p>And, yeah, I scored.</p><p>But that definitely wasn’t how things were supposed to go.  </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn7w14ejzyc08c1jz5.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Leon Halip/Getty Images"><figcaption>Leon Halip/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Off the field, things weren’t always smooth and easy, either.</p><p>Michigan was my dream school, and I loved everything about it — still do! — but it was never a situation where I was on easy street and everything just fell into place for me because I was scoring touchdowns at the stadium. I’m a small-town guy. I wasn’t looking for any special treatment or fame. I kind of just wanted to make people happy and greet everyone with a smile and represent for Michigan as best I could.</p><p>Sometimes it just wasn’t meant to be, though. </p><p>Once things really got rolling for me, and the highlights started to make the rounds, people would be coming out of the woodwork.</p><p>This one night, I left our team study hall, hopped in my car, drove back to my apartment, and as soon as I opened the door and got out, this guy I didn’t know jumped out of his car and ran up on me.</p><p>He’d been following me the entire time I was driving.</p><p>This guy had somehow found out I had study hall at a certain place, waited for me to come out, and, without me noticing, followed me home and parked his car right behind mine. Then he was all up on me like, “Yo, Denard! What’s up man? Can you sign this stuff for me real quick? It’ll only take a minute.”</p><p>It had me shook, I’m not gonna lie.</p><p>It was legit scary to me. Because … I don’t know this dude, and, I mean, you just never know, right?</p><p>Fortunately, it turned out that he was mostly harmless — just looking to make a quick buck, I guess — and I signed his stuff. But I had to be like, “Yo, never again, man. Please don’t do this to me again.”</p><p>That incident really changed everything for me at Michigan. After that, I was constantly looking over my shoulder, worried about who might be jumping out next. And I didn’t even tell my parents or brothers about it because I knew they would’ve been really, really worried for me.</p><p>When that went down, I just remember being like, <em>This is getting out of hand</em>.</p><blockquote>It had me shook, I’m not gonna lie.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>At one point, things got so crazy that I couldn’t even go to class anymore. Like I literally had one of my professors come up to me in private and ask me to stop showing up because me simply being present had become too much of a distraction. There’d be this chatter in the room, or people would be constantly coming up to me or whatever. And the professor had just had enough.</p><p>She was super nice about it, and I understood. But I’m someone who learns better in person, so having to do everything online wasn’t great.</p><p>Not how I would’ve written it up, for sure.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4423,h_2948,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn7vrrh56eswcbegpa.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Chris Graythen/Getty Images"><figcaption>Chris Graythen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And, you know what, the same can definitely be said for how things went down at the end of my college career.</p><p>During my time at Michigan, I set big, concrete goals for the future. It was: I’m going to be a star quarterback in the NFL and rewrite all the record books and be in the Hall of Fame. That’s where my head was at, and I had total confidence that I could make that happen. To me, it was going to be another one of those situations like I had before my first game at the Big House.</p><p><em>See it in your mind. Say it. Then — poof, just like that — it will happen.</em></p><p>But this is where the <em>life-happened</em> part of this article comes in. Because real life doesn’t always match up with what you visualize for yourself. And you definitely never envision injuries happening when you close your eyes and imagine what the future will hold.</p><p>Injuries are pretty much the mortal enemy of dreams when it comes to football. And, with me, that’s what my story turns on.</p><blockquote>Injuries are pretty much the mortal enemy of dreams when it comes to football. And, with me, that’s what my story turns on.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>Midway through my senior year, against Nebraska at their place, I sprinted out to the left, made some cuts and then dove for a first down. I landed with all my weight on my right arm and hand — just absolutely smashed them both into the turf — and then one of their guys accidentally stepped on my arm.</p><p>From there, everything changed for me.</p><p>Everything.</p><p>The next day, I headed into a doctor’s office back in Michigan, and the doc pulled up some scans and told me I may never play football again.</p><p><em>What????????</em></p><p>It didn’t even really hurt all that much when it happened, but now I’m hearing stuff like….</p><p>“Severe nerve damage.”</p><p>“This may not go away.”</p><p>“You may not ever be the same again.”</p><p>I went from lighting up teams on national TV and setting all kinds of records … to crying in some random doctor’s office.</p><p>And I couldn’t grip the ball.

That wasn’t what happened with me.</p><p>It was literally just me getting hurt, and still wanting to play football and help my team win. Since I couldn’t throw, playing a position other than quarterback was the only way I could do that at the tail end of my Michigan career.</p><p>So that’s what I did.</p><p>That’s why I switched to being a running-back-slash-receiver.</p><p>If I don’t get hurt in that Nebraska game … I never change positions. I ride or die as a quarterback into the league. That’s the honest truth. I was committed to making a name for myself in the NFL as a QB, and turning heads, and lighting up the scoreboard, just like I did at Michigan.</p><p>I was all in on that plan.</p><p>Now, could I have done it? Could I have been a great NFL quarterback? I guess that’s open to debate.</p><blockquote>If I don’t get hurt in that Nebraska game … I never change positions.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>You can have your own thoughts on that.</p><p>The fact is that … I <em>didn’t</em> do it.</p><p>What I did do is get hurt and move off quarterback and get picked up in the fifth round of the NFL draft.</p><p><em>Life happens.</em></p><hr /><p>At the time, I’m not gonna lie, as positive a person as I am — as much as I just want to be happy and optimistic and smiling — I was <em>hot</em> about falling all the way down to the fifth round of the draft. I really thought I’d put myself in a good position to be taken high. And seeing some of the random dudes who got picked up before me was super frustrating.</p><p>But, looking back on it now, I’m actually fortunate that I got drafted when I did.</p><p>I’m grateful that the Jaguars were willing to invest a pick in a player suffering from nerve damage in his hand who was also trying to learn a new position at the highest level.</p><p>And once I got over the initial frustration about my draft position, I was able to let that gratitude fuel my work in Jacksonville. I could be myself again and just appreciate the fact that, even if it wasn’t exactly as I’d envisioned things going, I was still doing something pretty special.</p><p>It was super fun trying to learn a new position, and seeing the progress happen on a week-by-week basis. You know what was the most fun thing of all, though?</p><p>Just knowing that I was an NFL player.</p><blockquote>Seeing that shield on my jersey? Getting to practice with NFL players? Running through the tunnel onto an NFL field? I ate that stuff up.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>That was something I had dreamt about ever since I was a kid.

So no longer being able to play? That was rough.</p><p>I really struggled with it for a while there. I found myself having a hard time being my usual positive self. There were definitely some low points, some moments when I was in my feelings and allowed them to drag me down.</p><p>But one good element of that whole <em>life-happens</em> thing is that … it works both ways.</p><blockquote>Football had been a special part of my life ever since I was five years old.

That was rough.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>Sometimes, when you least expect it, something happens that turns your life around and completely changes things <em>for the better</em>. </p><p>For me, that something was the birth of my son, Denard Xavier Robinson Jr., in the fall of 2017.</p><p>That little guy, he was my saving grace.</p><p>At the time, I was going back and forth to tryouts, looking to prove to teams I could still play — basically grinding like crazy, but with nothing to show for my efforts.

I didn’t miss anything he did. Him lifting his head for the first time, him rolling over, crawling, taking his first steps, his first words, I was there for all of that.  </p><p>Those experiences, being present for those moments, that made me forget about all the stuff in my life that wasn’t going right.</p><p>It didn’t make the bitter taste disappear completely — I still got down and frustrated at times that I wasn’t playing anymore — but my son, spending time with him, it made everything O.K.</p><p>He gave me something to be joyful about again, and now, thanks to him, I’m happier than ever.</p><p>The smile is all the way back.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2682,h_1788,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn7wcha6qznbqqtgdh.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Gregory Shamus/Getty Images"><figcaption>Gregory Shamus/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And hey, it’s not like football isn’t a part of my life anymore. It’s not like I hung up the cleats and then swore off football for good.</p><p>After my playing days came to an end, almost immediately I got into coaching.</p><p>I started out at Jacksonville University, when coach Ian Shields gave me my first big opportunity. I was helping out with the running backs and working with the special teams units. Then, last year, I linked back up with my former team, the Jaguars, as a member of the coaching staff. Doug Marrone, Dave Caldwell and Marcus Pollard were instrumental in bringing me in, and being back with the Jags has been a wonderful experience. The team’s owner, Shad Khan … I love that guy. He’s always been so great to me, and I can’t thank him enough for bringing me on.</p><p>I started out doing quality control work with the offense, learning a ton from Coach Terry Robiskie. Recently, I’ve begun to focus more on scouting. I’m out there trying to uncover those diamonds in the rough — small-school dudes, guys lighting it up at FCS schools. Just really trying to learn the ins and outs of as many parts of this profession as I can.</p><p>I’m super grateful to Trent Baalke and Urban Meyer for keeping me in the organization. And guys like Tom Gamble, Mike Davis, DeJuan Polk, Ricky Thomas Jr., Regis Eller, Joseph Anile, Lamar Sorey, Tyler Walker and Drew Hughes, they’ve been passing down their knowledge to me, and I couldn’t be more appreciative. I’m learning from the best. </p><p>And I’m having fun doing it. </p><p>In terms of my career, my profession, what I do for a living, that’s my new passion. I’m loving everything about it, and I’m just happy to be back in the NFL again.</p><blockquote>I’m definitely not someone to feel sorry for. I’m blessed, truly, truly blessed.<cite>Denard Robinson</cite></blockquote><p>So yeah, I’m doing good.</p><p>I’m definitely not someone to feel sorry for. I’m blessed, truly, truly blessed.</p><p>I have such an incredible, supportive family that I love more than anything, people who have always been there for me through thick and thin — my parents, Thomas Sr. and Dorothea; and my siblings, Thomas Jr., Tiara, Daniel Sr., Durrel, Timothy, Tevin, and Steven Corker. They made me who I am, and I am so fortunate to have them in my life.</p><p>Some people play to prove their haters wrong. But me? I always played for the people who supported me and showed me love over the years. I cannot thank them enough.</p><p>Also, from the very beginning, my hometown of Deerfield Beach has always had my back. I just hope that I made everyone there proud over the years. </p><p>And then, of course, there’s Michigan!</p><p>I still get back to Ann Arbor for games whenever I can. And every time, it’s like going home again. The memories come flooding back, and all the Michigan fans in town always show me so much love.</p><p>It’s like having a second family … only with 110,000 aunts and uncles and cousins.</p><p>When I’m not there in person on game day, I’m watching our games on TV and getting fired up like it was me out there on the field. I’m still over here hating that team from Ohio and cussing out Michigan State, and pulling for Coach Harbaugh and the guys with everything I’ve got.</p><p>Denard Jr. is all in now, too.</p><p>Obviously.</p><p>So when we play that team down south in a few days, you better believe the two of us will be watching the game together, fully locked in.</p><p>Lighting it up at the Big House was amazing. No one can ever take those memories away from me.</p><p>But when it’s just me and my son at Our House, chilling on the couch, watching the game together, rooting like crazy for the Maize and Blue?

Three world championships, seven All-Star Games, an MVP season, a batting title, five Silver Sluggers, three no-hitters caught, and on and on. He’s one of the greatest players in baseball history.   </p><p>But Buster Posey, for me, first and foremost … he’s my friend. </p><blockquote>Buster Posey, for me, first and foremost … he’s my friend.<cite>Brandon Crawford</cite></blockquote><p>Not long after he called me up to let me know he was going to retire, I knew I wanted to do something to show my gratitude and pay tribute to him. I needed to take some time to let it sink in, though. To get my thoughts together. I wanted to make sure I did this right. Because writing out something like this … let’s just say it’s not in my wheelhouse. So I’m going to do my best to get my points across here, but please stick with me if it doesn’t come out perfect or whatever. </p><p>I want to start out by saying how happy I am for my friend, because I know he’s completely content with this decision and is now going to be able to spend more time with his family.</p><p>Buster loves baseball for sure — loves the Giants, his teammates, our fans — but to be honest with you, that pales in comparison to how much he loves his family. And I truly admire and respect him for that.  </p><p>Kristen and those kids, they’ve been his top priority from Day One. And that’s never changed over the years. </p><p>It’s awesome to know that he and Kristen are going to be able to experience so many cool family milestones together as the kids grow up. All the memories that he’ll be making at home — while his former teammates are off ordering bad takeout in some hotel all the way across the country — that’s something you really can’t put a price tag on.   </p><p>So, at the end of the day, I’m mainly just super happy for my friend.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn6mq16epv9g6g5wmp.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Paul Kitagaki Jr./The Sacramento Bee/AP Photo"><figcaption>Paul Kitagaki Jr./The Sacramento Bee/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, though, it’s definitely going to be tough not having him around. It won’t be the same.</p><p>Buster’s been there my entire professional career. We were part of the same 2008 Giants draft class. And we go back even further than that. We actually played against each other in a summer tournament in high school, so we go all the way back to 2004. He was on Team Georgia, and I was on Team California. This was before either of us had gotten too much hype, and I won’t say who won, but I distinctly remember him being on the other team because, well….</p><p>You don’t forget a name like Buster Posey. </p><p>There just aren’t too many Busters walking around these days. </p><p>We crossed paths again four years later during rookie ball in Scottsdale and then played our first full season in the minors together in San Jose. Right away, I could tell he was going to be an exceptional player. Everyone who watched him could tell. </p><p>His talent as a hitter was clear as day. And because I was always at shortstop, playing behind him, I had as good a view as anybody at the passion and skill he brought to the catcher’s position. I saw how he was able to work with all different types of pitchers, understand their strengths and weaknesses, and then partner with them to give our teams the best shot to win. You could almost see his brain working sometimes when it came to pitch selection and setting guys up, and it was just a very cool thing to watch.  </p><p>But what really stood out to me was how Buster went about his business. How he carried himself, and prepared, and worked, and … just the mindset he took out onto the field every day.  </p><p>It was like the guy was a walking baseball clinic or something, the perfect example of how to do everything the right way when it comes to playing the game. </p><blockquote>Buster loves baseball for sure — loves the Giants, his teammates, our fans — but to be honest with you, that pales in comparison to how much he loves his family.<cite>Brandon Crawford</cite></blockquote><p>Buster’s someone who never seeks attention or praise. In fact, he actually prefers <em>not</em> to be the center of attention. He always just wanted to do his job and help his team win baseball games. </p><p>And what I started to notice, both in the minors and early on in my career with the Giants, was that his approach to the game, and the seriousness and attention to detail that he showed … that stuff trickles down to everyone on his team. </p><p>When you see your catcher, your leader, showing up every day with a singular focus of doing everything he can do to help his team win, without wanting any credit for it? When it’s not about ego? When it’s like: “This is what I’m supposed to do. This is my job. And I’m going to do it as well as I can”?</p><p>That perspective is contagious.</p><p>It’s definitely how I approach the game, too. And I could tick off a bunch of other guys who are the exact same way — Brandon Belt, Matt Cain, and on and on. So the younger players who join the Giants, they’ve seen the leaders on this team be that way for years. They just hop on the train, and it keeps rolling.   </p><p>I honestly think Buster’s approach to the game is what you’d point to as the definition of “Giants baseball” during his time in the Bay. That’s the brand of baseball we played. </p><p>He was like the walking embodiment of the <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/brandon-crawford-giants-fan-kid" target="_blank">San Francisco Giants.</a></p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2880,h_1920,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn6n3bgz8447rhyndv.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Christian Petersen/Getty Images"><figcaption>Christian Petersen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>One thing everyone talks about with Buster, of course, is how he’s always super calm and remains even-keeled at all times. He doesn’t get too high or too low, and never lets his emotions get the best of him.</p><p>But some of the Buster memories I cherish most are the ones where that emotion actually <em>did</em> sneak out somehow. In fact, what is maybe my all-time favorite Buster Posey moment is an example of that.</p><p>2012. NLDS. During what ends up being an absolutely magical run to the world championship. We lose the first two games to the Reds, but fight back to force a winner-take-all Game 5. And Giants fans, you remember this well, I’m sure. I don’t need to tell you guys that what Buster did in that game was special. </p><p>You guys know.</p><p>Goose bumps, right? Just straight up goose bumps. </p><p>But, for me, it’s not even the homer, or the clutch-ness of it that sticks in my mind the most. It’s Buster’s emotion and excitement and just his.… </p><p>Joy.</p><p>After he hit that grand slam against Latos, he was <em>definitely fired up</em>.</p><p>What I remember most about it is Buster rounding the bases and getting to home plate where the three guys he drove in were waiting for him, and then Buster just slapping the s*** out of their hands. And then him coming down into the dugout and doing the same thing to all the rest of us in there because he was so jacked up about giving us a six-run lead in such a big game. </p><p>And that last part, that right there is the key here. Because <em>why</em> he was fired up is really what makes it a signature Buster Posey moment for me. It wasn’t about, “Hey, look at what I just did.” This wasn’t one of those deals where a guy hits a huge home run, watches it, does a bat flip, then takes 60 seconds to circle the bases. This wasn’t that kind of emotion. It honestly wasn’t even about <em>him</em>.</p><p>With Buster, it was always all about the team.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn6ngre30ceqsnbm4m.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images"><figcaption>Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So, yeah, it goes without saying that the Giants are going to miss Buster Posey. </p><p>It’s going to be difficult not having him out there leading the charge next season. It’ll be different for sure.  </p><p>But, again, for me, the toughest part about this is going to be not seeing my friend for 162-plus days of the year. Not having those conversations, those moments that all good friends share — the little inside jokes, the laughs, the companionship. We’ve played together for so long, been through so much together. So, over the years, all those things have become part of what playing baseball means to me. </p><p>Even just sharing stories about our kids every day in the clubhouse — the dad stuff — as lame as it might sound, I’m really, really going to miss that.</p><p>Our families are super close. I’ve been to a bunch of his kids’ birthday parties. Our wives are good friends. When you play with somebody for such a long time, and your personalities are so similar, that person pretty much becomes like family. And I know we’ll still stay in contact, and hang out, but yeah … it’s gonna be tough. </p><p>You know what, though? Enough of me getting all emotional over here. Let me just end by saying this.</p><p>Buster Posey absolutely loved the San Francisco Giants. And every time he ran out onto the field in that Giants uniform, he gave all he had for this team and our fans. He’s a Giants legend, an all-timer for sure.</p><p>Buster was a special player. And he’s an even more special human being. </p><p>A few years from now, it’s going to be so cool to see my friend enshrined in Cooperstown, and then to visit the Hall of Fame and see that bronze bust of him wearing the San Francisco Giants cap.</p><p>I mean, you want to talk about special?</p><p>And lastly, Buster, if you happen to be reading this, I just want you to know that I am so proud of you, and that your friendship means the world to me.</p><p>I miss you already.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fn6nsphgfr9sv2ppck.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>MLB</category></item><item><title>The Guy with the Tie</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/maro-itoje-england-rugby-saracens?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Maro Itoje</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fm4zwt897n</guid><description>Maro Itoje&#39;s dream was to play for England Rugby. </description><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 12:40:50 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4800,h_2700,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm31vtjffavjym8f9r.jpg" caption="Dan Sheridan/INPHO/Shutterstock"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Maro Itoje"></flatplan:author><keywords>Rugby,maro itoje ,England</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Before we get to my 50 caps for England, I just want to tell you how this all started. I am aware that I’m supposed to talk about how this landmark was always a goal of mine, how playing for England was a dream I’d had since I was a child. </p><p>But I never <em>really</em> had any such grand visions per se. When I started out, I didn’t know whether I was going to be any good. I didn’t even know the rules. </p><p>Why was I playing? Three reasons, mainly. </p><p>1. I wanted to make friends at school. </p><p>2. I loved being part of a team. </p><p>3. I was <em>obsessed </em>with wearing the county club tie.  </p><p>Hahaha. I know it sounds silly, but the tie really did light a fire in me. I saw it when I was playing rugby at St George’s School just north of London. I already <em>liked </em>rugby. I was a lot stronger and taller than my peers, so I was obviously decent. The school had A, B and C teams, and I loved saying, “Yup, I’m part of the <em>A</em> team.” It sounded like I was part of some special unit. </p><p>However, I never got serious about rugby until I saw the ties. </p><p>In case you don’t know, rugby players at my school were allowed to wear representative honours ties. If you play for the county team, you wear a county tie. If you play for South East England, you wear a South East England tie. It’s essentially a piece of attire saying, <em>Look who I’m playing for. </em>Same as being on the A team, only you don’t have to communicate it. People look at the ties and go, <em>Ah. These guys are good</em>. </p><p>One day when I was 14, a group of students went away to play for the county team, and when they came back they were wearing these Hertfordshire county ties. I swear, my jaw dropped. My eyes popped out of my head. I was like, <em>Oh my goodness, that’s amazing. I want that tie. </em></p><p>Hahaha. I <em>had </em>to have that tie!!</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3236,h_2157,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm334h1vhkqcazmcs7.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="VoltaxImages" data-licensor-name="VoltaxImages" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Maro Itoje"><figcaption>Courtesy of Maro Itoje</figcaption></figure><p>So when the county trials came up for my age group, I was no longer playing for fun. I was no longer playing to make friends. This was my opportunity to get that tie. </p><p>I was like, <em>When we come back, I am gonna be </em>that<em> guy. </em></p><p>We went off for the trials, and soon I was strolling into school all like, <em>Yep, I’m here. I’m here with the tie</em>. </p><p>Hahaha. What a silly, silly moment. </p><p>(But deep down, I still think that tie was pretty cool.)</p><p>The crazy thing is that those trials led me to sign for Saracens, the team that I have played for ever since. I was chasing that tie so hard that their scouts took note of me. After the trials, this guy named Matt Davies came up to me and said, “Hey Maro, I’d like you to come to the Saracens Academy training. Would you be O.K. with that?”</p><p>I was so shocked, all I could say was, “Yeah.…” </p><p>Of course, I was super pumped. </p><p>But I knew that a lot of kids train with the academies and don’t make it, so I still didn’t know if rugby could become a career for me. That only really hit me when I was 16, and the academy manager invited me to train with the first team. I was like, <em>Oh, my goodness. </em>I got off the phone, ran upstairs and found my mum. She was on the phone, too. </p><p>I was like, “Mum, Mum, Mum! I’m gonna train with the first team tomorrow!!”</p><p>She moved the phone away from her ear, raised an eyebrow and said, “Oh. Is that meant to be a <em>good </em>thing?”</p><p>HAHAHAHA.</p><p>I was like, “<em>Yeah.</em>” Duh.</p><p>My parents, wow  … where do I even start?? </p><p>You have to know about them to really understand my trajectory. They were born in Nigeria, and even though we lived in London, once you stepped into our house you felt more like you were in Lagos. I’m talking about the culture, the customs, the quantities of food — I don’t know <em>how </em>many fridge-freezers my mum had. She was very popular, so all these relatives would come to our house to see her, and being Nigerians they would never call. They’d just turn up. My job was to open the door and tell my mum who it was.</p><p>I would shout out all these names as loud as I could.</p><p>“<em>Muuum</em>? Auntie Bissie’s at the door.”</p><p>“Uncle Balogun’s at the door.”</p><p>Add to that all the phone calls, and I was basically part doorman, part secretary. And everyone wanted to speak to my mum. Poor Dad, he was left all alone!</p><blockquote>Even though we lived in London, once you stepped into our house you felt more like you were in Lagos.<cite>Maro Itoje</cite></blockquote><p>Now, if there is one truth about Nigerian households, it is that they all have the same vision for their children. They want you to become a doctor, businessman, engineer or lawyer. They will still talk to you if you become a dentist. And if you descend into politics, maybe you can come home for dinner once in a while. </p><p>But everything else, forget it. They want professional jobs, <em>reliable </em>jobs. Jobs with a track record of success. </p><p>The worst jobs you can go for are in art and music. I don’t think they consider sports to be a particularly stable profession either.</p><p>Especially not sports that are virtually unknown in Nigeria. </p><p>When I told my parents that I had started playing rugby, they just saw it as a hobby. Then one day my housemaster called my dad and said, “Mr. Itoje, your son is quite good at rugby. He might have a future there.”</p><p>You might expect that my dad’s reaction would have been just pride. But instead my<em> </em>dad got worried. He’s old-school: strict, disciplined and <em>very </em>focused on my career. So he called me over — and you have to imagine this stern, Nigerian accent here….</p><p>He said, “Maro, I hear you are playing rugby now. I’m O.K. with it, but make sure that it doesn’t affect your schoolwork….”</p><p>Then the killer line. </p><p>“… because if the grades drop, the rugby stops.”</p><p>Hahahaha. </p><p>That was him in a nutshell.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm3bhb85kx4q7g0wbt.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="VoltaxImages" data-licensor-name="VoltaxImages" data-portal-copyright="Eliot Blondet/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP Images"><figcaption>Eliot Blondet/Abaca/Sipa USA via AP Images</figcaption></figure><p>I’m actually glad that my parents saw it that way, because they never put any pressure on me to do well in rugby. They were never going, “Make sure you wake up on time, make sure you eat this and that.” Whether things went badly for me, or even extremely <em>well</em>, it was never the be-all and end-all. They never saw my worth through the sport that I was playing. Rugby was never <em>really </em>part of the plan. </p><p>So it took a while for them to understand that it could become a career for me. Once they did, they were incredibly supportive. But they still had certain expectations that had to be met — above all that I got a degree. </p><p>My goodness, I don’t know <em>what</em> would have happened to them had I not gone to university. </p><p>Or actually, I kind of do, because one year, on April Fool’s day, I sent my dad an email. It went something like this…. </p><p><em>Dear Dad, </em></p><p><em>As you know, I want to be a rugby player and only that. So I don’t want you to put any pressure on me to go to uni, because I’m not going. </em></p><p><em>This is my decision. Hope you respect it. </em></p><p><em>Maro. </em></p><p>I smirked and pressed <em>send</em>. </p><p>My dad didn’t talk to me for three days. </p><p>He was so agitated. He called my mum in despair, but I had already told her to play along. He was like, “Have you <em>seen</em> what your son is doing?</p><p>Hahahaha. I was <em>her </em>son now. </p><p>She played her role superbly. She was like, “I know, he doesn’t want to go to uni. But what can we do? Can we <em>force</em> him? This is his decision.”</p><p>My dad was up in arms! He was like, “You are <em>supporting</em> this behaviour?!”</p><p>He was so embarrassed. He couldn’t sleep. He was pacing around the living room all like, “What am I going to do? What am I going to tell my friends?”</p><p>Hahaha. This is what it’s like to grow up in a Nigerian household. </p><blockquote>They never saw my worth through the sport that I was playing.<cite>Maro Itoje</cite></blockquote><p>That’s why I say that going to uni wasn’t <em>really</em> a choice. If I were stubborn, <em>maybe</em> I could have chosen not to. But I ended up doing a B.A. in politics at the University of London’s School of Oriental and African Studies, and I’m really glad I did. It made me appreciate the times I was<em> </em>playing rugby, and it exposed me to people I would not have met inside the rugby bubble. I became a more rounded person and, I would even say, a better player.</p><p>My schedule was mad for the first two years though, because I was studying full-time. My weekdays went something like this:</p><p>5:50 a.m. — Get up; bike to Saracens Academy (I couldn’t drive at the time)</p><p>6:50 a.m. — Weigh-in</p><p>7 a.m. — Gym</p><p>8:30 a.m. — Breakfast</p><p>10 a.m. — Training: four units of scrums, walls, etc.</p><p>1 p.m. — Squad meeting</p><p>2 p.m. — Cycle to station, catch train to uni in London</p><p>3 p.m. — Lectures </p><p>5 p.m. — Home </p><p>That was Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. But I was also on loan at a club called Old Albanian, so I would play a game there every weekend. As for Tuesdays, add this part:</p><p>6 p.m. — Catch lift to Old Albanian; if nobody’s driving, get on the bike</p><p>7 p.m. — Training</p><p>9 p.m. — Home; sleep</p><p>So yeah, it was a bit much. I<em> </em>would really struggle to do that now. But even though I was cooked when I got home, I didn’t consider it intense at the time like, <em>Ugh, I have to go training. </em>It was just what I had to do to get what I wanted. And I wanted to get my degree. I wanted to be good in a hurry. I didn’t want anyone to tell me that uni was taking away from my rugby, or vice versa. </p><p>I do think that if you <em>really</em> want something in life, you’ll always find a way to get it done.</p><p>The graduation ceremony made me prouder than I had expected. I missed it the year I was supposed to do it due to the 2017 Lions tour, which was probably a fair excuse. When I finally walked on stage and got my little thingy, all the work seemed worth it. </p><p>As for my parents, you can only imagine what it meant to them. </p><p>It’s funny how they have become these huge<em> </em>rugby fans now. They have gone everywhere to watch me play: Tokyo, New Zealand, South Africa. Their social lives are built around the rugby calendar. They even come to watch the Saracens second team on Monday nights. Earlier this year they asked me for tickets to the first games of the season. I said I wasn’t going to play many of them, because I had finished the previous season quite late.</p><p>My dad was like, “Get us those tickets. They need to know that we are there to <em>support! </em>Through thick and thin!” Hahaha. </p><blockquote>If you really want something in life, you’ll always find a way to get it done.<cite>Maro Itoje</cite></blockquote><p>My parents were also there for my most memorable moments, like when I got my first England call-up in 2016. I was in bed when Eddie Jones called me. I wasn’t <em>quite </em>sleeping, but I was drowsy. </p><p>Eddie said, “Maro, I wanna pick you for the Six Nations. Get ready to work.”</p><p>He hung up. That was it. </p><p>I jumped out of bed, ran downstairs and told my parents. This time they understood how big it was. I had wanted to be an England player for so long. When I ran onto the field against Italy, I was like, <em>That’s it, I’m an England player now. </em></p><p>It was official, you know? Nobody could take this away from me. It felt similar to when I had turned up at school with the county tie. </p><p>I was <em>that </em>guy. </p><p>Maro Itoje, England international. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2497,h_1664,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm3c19aanfk4q7zbwr.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="VoltaxImages" data-licensor-name="VoltaxImages" data-portal-copyright="David Davies/Press Association via AP Images"><figcaption>David Davies/Press Association via AP Images</figcaption></figure><p>I had to keep it up though, because nobody wants <em>one </em>cap, right? It’s almost worse than having none. I needed a few more to be at least semicomfortable. I also realised that you have to really commit your life to playing for England, otherwise you’re not going to keep your place. You can’t train like Tarzan and live like Mick Jagger, you know what I mean? </p><p>Then you find out that no matter how many caps you get, you always want more. When I was younger, I would always go, <em>What is the next goal? </em></p><p>At first it was breaking into the Saracens first team. </p><p>Then you turn to international honours. </p><p>Play for England. </p><p>Be a Lion. </p><p><em>Win </em>as a Lion. </p><p>Then you want more Premierships, more European Cups, more Lion tours. There is no final destination. </p><p>There is always another tie to chase. </p><p>And you <em>have </em>to think like that, because this sport moves very quickly. Not long ago the Lions tour was the biggest thing in the world for me. Now all roads lead to France 2023, and my ultimate goal of winning a World Cup for England. </p><p>Dwell too much on the past, and you might get stuck there. </p><p>And anyway, the exciting story is the one that is yet to be written, right? </p><p>All of which means that I shouldn’t talk too much about getting to 50 caps. But let me just say that I am very proud of them. They mean that I have had a long and sustained career for England. Not many people get to that number, and I never thought I would be one of them. </p><p>This is just a landmark, though. I’m by no means done yet.</p><blockquote>Not long ago the Lions tour was the biggest thing in the world for me. Now all roads lead to France 2023.<cite>Maro Itoje</cite></blockquote><p>Sometimes I get asked what I would have told my younger self if I could go back in time. If I had told that kid that he’d get 50 caps for England, what would he say?</p><p>It’s an interesting question, but you know what? I wouldn’t have told him that in the first place. I fear that it would have reduced his hunger. </p><p>When you are certain<em> </em>of success, there is a chance that you’ll slow down.</p><p>So I would rather have told him to just keep getting up early. </p><p>Do your homework. </p><p>Learn the rules.</p><p>Get that tie. </p><p>And then one day, maybe you’ll get somewhere.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm339sa8xhpg33awgy.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="VoltaxImages" data-licensor-name="VoltaxImages" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>Rugby</category></item><item><title>Eddie Kingston Got No Business F***ing Being Here</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/eddie-kingston-aew-wrestling?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Eddie Kingston</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fkkcxyj6m8</guid><description>This is the story of Eddie Kingston: “I have been everything in this life.

Insane. Psychotic. Violent. Sick. </p><p>“Oh, come on, Eddie. You’re bullshitting. This is a work. We get it. It’s part of the character.” </p><p>My guy, you really don’t understand. I’ve been out of my mind since before I can remember. When I was in the 10th grade, I got into a beef with this kid over some stupid neighborhood bullshit. I literally couldn’t even tell you what it was about. The next day, I’m sitting in class and I see the dude walking in the hallway. I’m full of testosterone, piss and vinegar, so I pop right up out of my chair like, “What’s up?”</p><p>Now, this is Yonkers, so we’re not meeting outside in the parking lot after lunch or whatever. No, bro. It’s <em>on</em>. Dude drops his books and charges into the room and straight up bull rushes me. Right in the middle of class — papers flying everywhere, teachers screaming, kids jumping up on the desks. Pandemonium. And we were in <em>religion </em>class, as a matter of fact. Right hand to God, I snapped. I blacked out. I’m throwing haymakers. I’m smacking the dude with books, folders, everything. They’re trying to teach us the New Testament and I’m trying to German suplex a motherf*cker into the chalkboard. It was out of control. </p><blockquote>I wanted to fight the world.<cite>Eddie Kingston</cite></blockquote><p>The only thing that saved me from jail was the fact that I was so young. I was just an angry, angry, angry kid. I wanted to fight the world. I never felt like I fit in anywhere. I was half Irish, half Puerto Rican, so I was getting it from all sides. When I was in the Irish part of the neighborhood it was, “Hey, what’s up spic.” And when I was in the Puerto Rican part of the neighborhood it was some other nonsense. Seriously, in the second grade I remember hearing, “Hey, get this spic outta here.” </p><p>That leaves a mark on you. It either makes you soft or it makes you into a maniac. Well, guess what it made me? From the minute my uncles taught me how to throw a punch when I was 11 years old, I was out on the streets swinging for the fences. The only thing that could keep me calm was wrestling tapes. We’re talking about the old VHS tapes. My mother used to go to VideoVision in the Bronx — not Blockbuster, we’re talking VideoVision, the mom-and-pop shop with the cat behind the counter and the ADULT section — and she didn’t know what she was doing so she’d grab anything that said <em>wrestling</em> on it. On Fridays, if I made it through the week without trying to choke anybody out in my elementary school, my reward was Chinese food and a wrestling tape. </p><p>I remember she brought home this random tape one night, and you gotta remember back in the ’90s you didn’t know WHAT you were getting into with the VHS tapes. When you rented something, they gave you that hard plastic mystery box with no cover on it. So I hijacked the living room TV (My Irish dad is screaming out, “I wanna watch the NEWS but the BOY got the WRESTLIN’ on again!!!” My Puerto Rican mother is screaming back from the kitchen, “Relax!!! He was good this week!!!!”). I popped in this random tape and after the static and the tracking and all the fuzz and everything, these three words flashed up on the screen. </p><p>MEMPHIS’ BLOODIEST BRAWLS</p><p>From the minute I saw that tape, I was obsessed. It was like something beaming in from another planet. Another crazy-ass dimension. This tape had everything. It had the infamous Tupelo, Mississippi, concession stand brawl from ’79. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, YouTube it. It’s a normal tag team match that starts in the ring. Then the guys fight their way through the crowd all the way back to the concession stand area, and they start smashing each other with popcorn machines and pots and pans and hot dogs. And the whole time the lady working the concession stand is screaming, “Stop! Stop! Stop! Security!!!!!!!” </p><p>It blew my mind. Picture it. I’m this half-Irish, half–Puerto Rican little maniac sitting on the couch in the Bronx eating wonton soup, watching old school Memphis wrestling, looking at my mother like, <em>Are you seeing this? Can you believe this??? </em></p><p>This tape had everything. It had Eddie Gilbert running over Jerry Lawler with his car in the parking lot outside the arena. It had guys getting busted open, bleeding out onto the mat. I barely even understood what wrestling was, but I knew at that moment what I wanted to grow up to be. </p><p>I didn’t want to hit a home run at Yankee Stadium. </p><p>I didn’t want to throw a touchdown pass at the Super Bowl. </p><p>I didn’t wanna be a f*cking astronaut. </p><p>I wanted to be a professional wrestler. </p><p>As the years went on, and I grew up and got to middle school, I discovered All Japan Pro Wrestling and Internet message boards and the tape-trading scene in New York City. You’d be waiting MONTHS to get your hands on some All Japan Triple Crown tape through a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy in Queens or something. You had to have something good to trade though. It was kind of like Pokémon cards, except you had to meet a random dude from the Internet on some street corner. You would show up somewhere and swap tapes with a random dude, and yo — <em>anything</em> could be on there when you popped it in the VCR. You didn’t know what you were getting into. You just were hoping that the dude was legit. Praying you didn’t get<em> got.</em> Praying you’d get home and pop the tape in and see some Japanese characters on the screen with flames shooting out and a dude in a suit screaming out incomprehensible nonsense from the announcer’s table. Praying you got an All Japan tape and not an old episode of <em>Martin</em> or something.  </p><p>I’ll literally never forget the first time I got my hands on Kawada vs. Misawa, June ’94. That’s all you gotta say to the true fans. Just say the date. June ’94. Everybody knows. These dudes were chopping one another so hard you could still see the sweat flying off them on the grainy VHS tape. The echo was so loud that I couldn’t believe it. The back suplexes, my God. It was so violent, so real. I’m watching this match in our little apartment in Yonkers, and I can’t even sit down. I watch it <em>now</em>, to this day, and I can’t sit down. I’ve probably seen June ’94 more than 1,000 times — hand to God. I’ll be sitting in an airport, waiting for my flight to board, and I’ll pull it up on YouTube and I’ll just be <em>gone. </em>I’ll be <em>in</em> it. I’ll be <em>living</em> it. </p><p>I’ve almost missed so many flights over that match. Dude from Delta will come over to tap me on the shoulder like, “Sir!” And I’m not even there, bro. I’m in Tokyo, feeling every clothesline. </p><blockquote>You’d be waiting MONTHS to get your hands on some All Japan Triple Crown tape through a guy who knew a guy who knew a guy in Queens or something.<cite>Eddie Kingston</cite></blockquote><p>Watching wrestling was always my escape. It was like my little sanctuary, man. It was probably the only thing that kept me out of jail. In high school, my friends used to be calling me up at night to come out and get up to who knows what, and I’d stay at home by myself to watch <em>Raw</em> or watch the Super J-Cup or ECW. To all my real New Yorkers: Remember ECW used to come on the RELIGIOUS CHANNEL at like two o’clock in the morning for some reason? You used to be fighting to stay awake, and one minute it would be some nice lady talking about healing or forgiveness whatever, and then all of a sudden it was…. </p><p>EEEEEEE SEEEEEEE DUBBLE-YEEEEWWWWWWWW!!!</p><p>Guys are getting hit with the barbed wire baseball bat. They’re getting Dudley Death Dropped through tables. They’re <em>moonsaulting</em> into the crowd. </p><p>On the <em>religious </em>channel. </p><p>I’m saying, it was like a message from another dimension. The devil was taking control, bro. I remember when I first discovered ECW, I felt like I was watching guys I <em>knew</em>. I mean I watched WWF like everybody else, but it always felt kind of soft to me. ECW, it wasn’t characters, it was like real guys I knew from the street corner. </p><p>I <em>knew </em>guys like New Jack. I <em>knew</em> guys like Dreamer.</p><p>When those guys went through the table, it was like your uncle going through the table. </p><p>To be honest with you, the only thing that kept me from getting depressed was wrestling. I either had to be fighting in the neighborhood, or sitting at home watching a match. Otherwise, I’d fall into a depression. Back then, I didn’t even have the words<em> </em>for it. I was trying to be such a hard-ass that I didn’t want to hear about no mental health, no therapists, no<em> feelings.</em> </p><p>“Depression? The f*ck is a depression?”</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3236,h_2157,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm0gsprnnw6qsv890r.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Mary Mathis/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Mary Mathis/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>When I couldn’t control it, I’d end up throwing hands with dudes in the middle of class. The Religion Class Brawl got me kicked out of my high school, as a matter of fact. At 18, my life was going nowhere. Thank God, my father and all my uncles were ironworkers, and they knew I could handle myself with grown men, and they knew I could ball-bust, which is definitely key, so they got me into the Ironworkers Local 580. These were the guys who were down at the World Trade Center going through the wreckage after 9/11. Just some real, blue-collar, New York tough guys. Not like the movies. <em>Real life</em> tough guys. Guys who used to pack a flask and two packs of cigarettes with their lunch every day. </p><p>I’ll never forget, one day I was on a jobsite 50 stories up. Columbus and 59th. I’m sitting on a steel beam, looking out over all of Manhattan, and I turn over my shoulder and I see this guy, he’s maybe 70 years old, and he’s eating his sandwich and he’s smoking his cigarette, and he’s talking about how he’s just gotta hang on a few more years so he can save up some more money and get his kid into the union, and it was like everything stopped. Everything went silent. And I had this realization. </p><p><em>This is not what I want to do with the rest of my life. I know what the hell I want to do. I’ve always known. </em></p><p>I went home that night and I got on the computer and I prayed that the little yellow AOL guy would connect, and when he did, I typed in “Pro Wrestling Schools NYC.”</p><p>That was the start of a journey that changed my life. Three years later, I was a star. I was making millions. I was walking out through the curtain at WrestleMania. </p><p>Hahahahahah. *Raspberry fart*</p><p>Are you kidding me? Three years later, I was dead broke, overweight, depressed, and wrestling in front of eight people in a bingo hall. I remember there was this place we always used to do shows in Palo Alto, Pennsylvania. Me and a buddy used to drive out there, wrestle, hopefully get paid, and then drive back. You’d spend your whole check on gas and a meal afterward. So we get up there to do the show, and we’re backstage getting ready, and we could all tell it was kind of quiet. Lace up the boots, go through the curtain, look out into the crowd….</p><p>Eight people. </p><p>Three on one side of the ring. Four on the other. One weird dude sitting alone. </p><p>My first thought was, <em>Welp, we’re not getting paid tonight. Let’s make the best of this.</em></p><p>The thing about wrestling in front of eight people in a bingo hall is that the spots still hurt. The chops still hurt. Your body still hurts the next day. But when you love wrestling, it doesn’t matter. You do it for the pride and the respect of the business. So I gave everything I could, and I’ll never forget there was this one lady in the crowd who was just going <em>nuts</em>. She was standing up, yelling at us, talking shit. And that fired me up, and I was turning to her and calling her all kinds of names. Don’t cancel me, please, but I think I called her Large Marge. She was throwing popcorn. It was incredible. </p><p>The match ends, we get backstage, and of course the promoter can’t pay. I remember the guys were sitting around talking about where we were gonna go eat, and I was so broke that I had to lie and say I wasn’t hungry. </p><p>Doing that bullshit thing like, “Ah no, I’m good. I’m good. I’m <em>full</em>. I’ll come sit with you guys and have a water or something.” </p><p>And my tag-team partner and buddy was such a good guy, he would always pay for me without telling anybody. So after the show, we’re all out in the parking lot packing up the truck, and I’m feeling pretty depressed about everything, when all of a sudden I hear this voice shout, “Hey!!!! Hey guys!!!!”</p><p>It’s Large Marge. </p><p>She’s like, “Guys, that was<em> awesome</em>. I had such a blast. You guys rock. Thank you!!!!”</p><p>I spent 20 years on the road in the indies, never quite making it, getting bitter, getting self-destructive, getting depressed, having to ask my parents for money so I could make rent. And to be honest with you, sometimes I have no idea why I kept going. </p><p>But I think it probably has something to do with that lady. </p><p>Sometimes, it just takes <em>one</em> person. You make their night, and it keeps you going. So I kept going, for 16 more years, wrestling all over the country, doing shows in ice rinks and VFWs and Elks Clubs and parking lots, and never making it to the big time. I used to call ironworking my hobby and pro wrestling my real job. The union guys got a kick out of that. When I started getting older and my body started breaking down, I got heavy into painkillers. I started drinking more. Then I got so down on myself and so angry and depressed that I ended up kicking the pills just because I thought, “Hey, you know what? What am I spending all this money on pills for? Shit, I’d rather spend it all on booze!”</p><p>Ain’t that sad? </p><p>So I drank. Christ, did I drink. I became a bouncer just so I could drink more. On the weekends I’d start drinking at 1 p.m. on Saturday, bounce at the bar until 7, go and wrestle somewhere, then come back to the bar after and drink til 7 in the morning. Then I’d wake up the next day and it was football Sunday, so I’d drink from noon till 2 a.m. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm0fnqwrx1xmzcgbnm.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Michael Watson"><figcaption>Michael Watson</figcaption></figure><p>I was sick. I hated myself. I would sit at home drinking whiskey, watching guys who I’d come up with in the indies wrestling on national TV in the big promotions, and I’d just sit and stew until I blew up. I’d punch holes in the walls. I’d smash bottles. I was a danger to myself and others. One week, I ended up going on a bender that was so bad that I just kind of disappeared. I was supposed to be doing shows and I just didn’t show up. I smashed my cell phone and no one could get ahold of me. People were scared that I was dead. I woke up one afternoon and there were just beer bottles smashed everywhere in my apartment. For some reason, I checked my mailbox, probably looking for a miracle check or something, and I had a letter. I’m like, “A letter? The last person that ever wrote me a letter was my grandma.” </p><p>I opened this letter, and it was from my friend Alex Whybrow, aka Larry Sweeney. Longtime indie wrestler, amazing dude. He wrote me a letter as a last resort. He said everyone was really worried about me and he begged me to reach out. And I’ll never forget, this one line at the end, it said….</p><p>“I feel like I’ve lost my best friend. Please call me.” </p><p>For some reason, that woke me up. I called Alex and I crawled up out of my hole. I just always felt like nobody ever cared about me. I felt like a failure, a loser, a bad friend. It’s something that’s been with me since I was a kid. If Alex hadn’t sent me that letter, I don’t think I would be here today. I probably would have drank myself to death. He saved my life. </p><p>And the saddest part about it is that those words that he said to me must have come from a very deep place within himself ... because he ended up taking his own life just a few years later. I think he knew the pain that I was going through. He knew that darkness. </p><p>And that’s why I’m telling this story, and I’m not pulling any punches, and all the old-school guys who don’t want to hear this stuff, and think that we shouldn’t talk about it, those guys can respectfully kiss my ass. If I wasn’t on Zoloft, if I wasn’t getting help for my mental health, if I was too afraid to talk about this stuff, I’d end up killing myself. Period. I’ve lost too many friends in this business to shut my mouth and bury all of these emotions with pills and booze. </p><blockquote>If I wasn’t getting help for my mental health, if I was too afraid to talk about this stuff, I’d end up killing myself. Period.<cite>Eddie Kingston</cite></blockquote><p>In memory of Alex, I’m telling this story. He saved me. But he couldn’t save himself. So many days, I just didn’t wanna be here anymore. I had so much guilt and anger and shame. After Alex’s death, I slowly started to get help and clean myself up a bit, but I looked up one day and I was 37 years old, and I realized that it was just never going to happen for me. The big boys were never going to give me a shot. I’d burned too many bridges. Told too many promoters to go to hell. Had too much of a reputation. </p><p>I was done. One day my brother was over at my house, and I told him that I was thinking of moving to Alaska. Work with my hands. Start a new life. I wasn’t married. Didn’t have any kids. I’d given my whole life to the business, and I was a failure, and it was time to call it a day. </p><p>He just looked at me, like only a <em>brother</em> can look at you, and then he took a sip of whiskey and he paused. Then he said, “Alright. Hey, you do you. It’s your life. What am I gonna tell my son, though?” </p><p>My nephew had just been born. </p><p>I said, “What the hell are you talking about?” </p><p>He said, “How am I gonna tell my son not to be a quitter when his uncle quit on his dream?” </p><p>And I just looked at him like: “You son of a bitch. How <em>dare </em>you help me? How <em>dare </em>you.”</p><p>I had this vision of my nephew in the first grade, talking to his friends at school, like, “My uncle’s a wrestler!”</p><p>And you know how little kids are: “What??? No he’s not!!! Your uncle’s not a wrestler!!!”</p><p>I decided in that moment that I couldn’t quit. I had to keep going for a few more years, just so that my nephew could be old enough to pull up YouTube on his phone at school and show that kid a clip of his old Uncle Eddie suplexing some dude in the middle of the ring. I knew it wasn’t going to be in the WWE or AEW or anything like that. But I didn’t care. As long as it was in a bingo hall or a VFW — as long as his uncle was really a wrestler, I didn’t care. </p><p>So I kept going. Then, a year later, COVID hit. I was wrestling overseas in the U.K. when everything shut down, and I had to spend my last $2,000 just to get home when the borders were closing. All the indies were shut down for months, and I immediately knew what it meant for me. I could see the end. I had to sell some of my wrestling boots to make my mortgage payment. I had a month left to start making some scratch or I’d lose the house. I called up my mom and told her the deal. It was humiliating. I was going to have to move back in with her and my dad in Yonkers if things didn’t work out. </p><blockquote>I had to sell some of my wrestling boots to make my mortgage payment.<cite>Eddie Kingston</cite></blockquote><p>Then I got this call to do an outdoor match in New Jersey. They got permission to set up a ring in the middle of a parking lot and to have people watching from their cars. I couldn’t say no. I went up to Jersey to do the show thinking that it could be the last match I ever did. I was about to lose my house. I was desperate. </p><p>So, after my match, for some reason, I just grabbed the microphone, and I just started doing what I do best. I started talking trash. I called out all the champions of the big-time promotions. And I didn’t even think anything of it. I was just being me. I was doing what I love to do. But then, somehow, someone captured my rant and posted the clip on social media, and it made it all the way to Cody Rhodes and AEW. I guess they thought it was funny or crazy or I don’t know what — but I got a call out of the blue from AEW talent relations, and they said, “Hey, we saw your clip. We want you to come in and wrestle Cody.” </p><p>And I’m so depressed and down on myself at this point that the first thing out of my mouth was, “How much does it pay?”</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9yJVfKIWdXk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>I didn’t think it was a tryout. I didn’t think it was a miracle. I didn’t think about anything except, <em>I need to pay my mortgage. </em>To me, it was just a booking. A paycheck. I’m 38 years old. They’re not going to sign me. This is just some bullshit stunt. I swear to you, when I got to the show and I was backstage, I was just numb. I wasn’t talking to anybody. I wasn’t excited. </p><p>There was no <em>8 Mile </em>moment with me in front of the mirror. I was literally thinking, <em>Let me just get this over with so I can get my check. </em>I remember Cody was so great about everything — and he actually asked me what I wanted for my walk-out music and I told him the truth: I said, “Why would I have music? I don’t work here. I wouldn’t have music. I should just run out and start beating the shit out of you, like I’m some guy. Because I am just some guy.” </p><p>And he said, “Alright, but let’s give you a microphone then.” </p><p>I said, “A mic?”</p><p>He said, “Yeah, just come out with the mic and start tearing into me.” </p><p>I mean, this is Cody Rhodes. This is <em>the guy</em>. And he’s telling me to come out and shit on him. I think about that now and I get goose bumps. I didn’t even deserve it, but he let me have that moment, and it changed my life. </p><p>Another guy who changed my life in that moment ... and damn, I am going to get emotional just thinking about this, because he’s not with us anymore….</p><p>But another guy who changed my life was Brodie Lee. (Rest in peace.) I had known Brodie for years from the indie circuit. Just the best guy. A true pro. He was standing backstage right before I was about to go out through the curtain, and he could see that I was just numb. He walked up to me all serious, and he goes, “Hey, where’s the Eddie Kingston I know?”</p><p>He shoved me hard. I stumbled back. And it’s like he woke up the beast. </p><p>I looked him right in the eyes and I shoved him back. </p><p>He stumbled back a couple of steps and then he looked at me and said, “There he is.”</p><p>We just started cracking up. </p><p>I walked out through that curtain that night a very broken man. Thirty-eight years old. Bitter. Self-destructive. About to move back in with his mother.</p><p>I cannot explain to you what happened next. I still don’t understand it. I am still waiting for someone to wake me up from the dream. </p><blockquote>I walked out through that curtain that night a very broken man.<cite>Eddie Kingston</cite></blockquote><p>I wrestled Cody, like I’ve wrestled 10,000 guys, 10,000 times before. I did my job. I beat him up. He beat me up. I powerbombed him onto some thumbtacks. I  tried to tell a story. I tried to make somebody out there watching <em>feel </em>something. Even if it was just one person who was having a shitty day who was using our match as an escape. </p><p>I just did my job, and he pinned me, and then I walked back through the curtain. </p><p>And that’s when I saw Brodie Lee and Jon Moxley. They weren’t jumping around. They weren’t clapping. They weren’t telling me that I was the man. That’s not them. I just noticed that they were smiling. </p><p>I said, “Was it alright?” </p><p>Mox said, “You did good. You beat him up good.” </p><p>And that’s when I realized, <em>Oh man. Hey, you were just on national television. That’s pretty cool. If I’m done, then at least I have this. </em></p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3236,h_2157,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm0fv0z4c970cn4d48.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Mary Mathis/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Mary Mathis/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>When the match aired on TV, something weird started happening with my phone. Twitter, social media, all that stuff — I still don’t really get how it works. It’s not my thing. So I saw all this shit start popping up on my phone with that little bird, but I was confused. Then I started getting all these text messages, and then someone from AEW texted me, “Eddie, you’re trending.” </p><p>And I said, “Trending? What is that? Does that mean I get paid more?” </p><p>She hit me back, “No, this is a big deal. They’re tweeting #SIGNEDDIEKINGSTON. It’s everywhere. There’s thousands of people. They’re begging AEW to sign you.”</p><p>It’s still so weird to me, even now, because I have such a hard time accepting love. I’m a hard-ass New York guy. I don’t trust it. I’m suspicious. I’m always waiting for the other shoe to drop. So when all these random people were standing up for me, I was just numb. I was uncomfortable. I didn’t get it. Even when AEW called me and told me that they wanted to offer me a contract, it just didn’t sink in. It was too surreal for a guy like me. </p><p>It wasn’t until two weeks later — I was on vacation out in Montana with my girlfriend, and we were just sitting in the car, about to go inside her friend’s house, and I paused for a second and I turned to her and said, “Hey wait.”</p><p>She said, “What’s wrong?”</p><p>I said, “You know I’m signed right? I’m on national television. My nephew can watch his uncle on TV. Like, I’m really signed. I mean, 20 f*cking years in this. I was about to lose my house. I was about to….”</p><p>And I just started crying. This wave came over me, and I finally understood what was happening, and I started bawling right there in the car. </p><p>I have been everything in this life. I have been an angry kid. I’ve been a depressed teenager. I’ve been an addict. I’ve seen so many holding cells it would make your head spin. I’ve messed up and self-destructed and burned bridges. I’ve been down to my last dollar. </p><p>The only reason I’m still doing this, and really the only reason I’m still on this earth is because of all the friends who never stop having my back. </p><p>I’m so lucky to have had a friend like Larry Sweeney. </p><p>I’m so lucky to have had a friend like Brodie. </p><p>I’m so lucky to still have a friend like Mox. (And I’m so proud of him for showing real courage right now. I got you, brother. Keep your head up.)</p><p>You know what’s crazy? Back in the day, me and Mox used to wrestle each other at the Elks Lodge in Brooklyn in front of 85 people. It was so surreal to walk through that curtain with him in Jacksonville at AEW’s first big live show after COVID, in front of 5,000 screaming people, wrestling against the Young Bucks on national television. I remember right before Mox kicked open the door and we walked down the aisle, he looked at me and he said, “Hey, get ready to be a f*cking star. Now let’s go kick these guys’ asses.” </p><p>I still have my struggles. </p><p>I still have a hard time accepting all this love and attention.</p><p>I still have to take my Zoloft. </p><p>I still have panic attacks. </p><p>As a matter of fact, I had one right after I fought Miro at the <em>All Out</em> PPV. My phone started blowing up with all these people telling me great job, just showing me love, and I just couldn’t handle it. I got overwhelmed. My chest got tight. The walls started closing in. I started to go numb. It felt like I was breathing through a straw. But I was able to calm myself down and slow my breathing, because I’d been strong enough to reach out and get professional help, and I know what to do now. I know how to live with my anxiety and depression. And I’m not afraid to talk about it. I don’t care what the old-school guys in the business have to say about it. It ain’t 1987 no more. </p><p>I know that I am not fixed. I am not perfect. I still have some really dark days, to be honest with you. But when I wake up in the morning, no matter how bad I feel, I know one thing for sure, and I’m damned proud of it….</p><p>I know that no matter how this all turns out from here, I can always look my nephew in the eye and tell him that his old, broken, beaten-up Uncle Eddie never quit. </p><p>And when he grows up a little more and he gets to the first grade and some punk kid tells him, “Your uncle’s not a wrestler. You’re lying,” he can whip out his phone and show him a video of his Uncle Eddie walking out through the curtain in front of 20,000 screaming fans at Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens — right down the block from where he used to trade Japanese wrestling tapes and get into street fights and run from the cops. </p><p>My nephew can look that little punk dead in his eyes and say, “See?” </p><p>His uncle ain’t a New York Yankee. </p><p>He ain’t a doctor or a lawyer. </p><p>He ain’t a f*cking astronaut. </p><p>He’s a wrestler. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fm0fyetymp5pd1jnc6.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>AEW </category></item><item><title>St. Louis </title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/matt-carpenter-st-louis-cardinals-mlb-baseball?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Matt Carpenter</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fkr4qcmpa6</guid><description>Matt Carpenter says goodbye to the St. Louis Cardinals: “No matter where we go next, St. Louis is and always will be home.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:48:14 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2496,h_1404,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fkycgjayfn180hhmhx.jpg" caption="Rob Tringali/MLB via Getty Images"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Matt Carpenter"></flatplan:author><keywords>MLB,St. Louis Cardinals,BASEBALL,matt carpenter </keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s something about home plate at Busch Stadium. It might just look like another batter’s box to you. But it’s different, man. It really is. When I was up to bat, I could feel the rhythm of the park — the heartbeat of a baseball city. On a fall night, 45,000 in the stands, I could feel all of St. Louis right there under my cleats. In my chest. There’s nothing like it and I can promise you I never <em>ever </em>took that feeling for granted. </p><p>Every time I stepped into that box, with the birds on the bat stitched across my chest, I was reminded of what it meant to be a Cardinal. I could close my eyes and see all the greats who put on this jersey before me. I <em>cherished</em> that feeling. I cherished it all the way until the end. </p><p>But the end is here. </p><p>My time wearing that iconic uniform is over. Goodbyes can be really hard. And I really felt like I owed each and every member of Cardinal Nation something. Because these last few months, once people started to understand that I might not be back next year, that this might be the end, I’ve been getting a lot of “thank you” messages. And I appreciate that. I really do. But I’m hearing them, and I’m reading them, and I’m thinking about it like….</p><p>No, man. <em>I’m </em>the one that should be saying thank you. <em>Y’all </em>are who need to be thanked. I’m the one who is filled with nothing but overwhelming gratitude.</p><p>Because this should have never happened. If it weren’t for the Cardinals organization — if it weren’t for St. Louis — my baseball career probably would have ended 12 years ago on a field in Austin, Texas.</p><blockquote>I’m the one that should be saying thank you.<cite>Matt Carpenter</cite></blockquote><p>I was a fifth-year senior at TCU. That’s right — 23 years old in his fifth college baseball season. Not exactly a can’t-miss prospect. We had just lost to Texas in the NCAA super regionals. And as I walked off the field, and looked my dad in the eye…. I knew what he was thinking. I could see it. He didn’t have to say it. Mom didn’t have to say it. But I think we all thought the same thing: There was a pretty good chance that I had played my last ever baseball game. </p><p>I’d been in love with the sport since I can remember. Heck, holding a bat on my shoulder is probably the very first memory I have. I spent countless hours with my dad working on my game, playing catch with my brother. I thought about the game all the time. I <em>dreamt</em> about the game. It was just … it was <em>all we did. </em>I really mean that. So on that field, wearing my Frogs jersey, it was hard not to be emotional. </p><p>I hadn’t heard from a scout my entire college career. Not one phone call. I didn’t have an agent. I split playing time as a freshman. I was nothing spectacular as a sophomore. And then my junior year, when most college players start their pro careers, mine was derailed by Tommy John. (I know what you&#39;re thinking: “You&#39;re not a pitcher….” Trust me, I know.) I was challenged in ways I never thought I would be as a college player. Both on and off the field, I took many lumps.</p><p>My coach, Jim Schlossnagle, made it very clear to me the day before my surgery that I had two options. One: keep going down this road of mediocrity and let my career play out with no chance of going anywhere. Or two: rededicate myself to the game. Find that passion I had when I was a kid. Get better every day and finish my career here strong.</p><p>I did just that. I came back leaner, stronger and with a reignited passion for being the best version of myself that I could be. I had a great senior year, and a really strong super regionals against Texas. And it gave me a glimmer of hope that, just maybe, somebody was watching somewhere.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fkybfr23crv9rfkg1z.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Chris Carson/AP Photo"><figcaption>Chris Carson/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>I didn’t know that anyone actually <em>was</em> watching until my aunt texted on June 10, 2009. </p><p>“Congratulations!”</p><p><em>Congratulations? Huh?</em></p><p>I thought on that for a split second.</p><p>And then it hit me.</p><p>I was packing up my place at college that day to go back home and move in with my parents and figure out what was next for me. But I had the MLB draft open over on my computer, so I ran over to refresh. And I’d never been more upset at my crappy WiFi than I was at that moment when the page wouldn’t load. I’m staring at the bar like, <em>not now, not today. </em></p><p>Then, like a dream, there it was. </p><p>PICK #399 — MATT CARPENTER — ST. LOUIS CARDINALS</p><p>A <em>dream</em>. </p><p>But the thing is … a couple days passed, and I hadn’t heard anything from anyone with the Cardinals. I kept checking the draft results. Making sure I was reading it properly. <em>Did they mean … me? Maybe there’s another Matt Carpenter? It’s gotta be me, right?</em> </p><p>But then, right on time, Aaron Krawiec, the scout who had drafted me, called and welcomed me to the organization. I was a professional baseball player. I still don’t know how it happened — but the Cards saw me, and they saw something <em>in </em>me. They gave me a chance. And for that, I’m forever grateful. </p><p>I also knew I had to prove them right. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fkybm1b8acz225f7xb.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Taka Yanagimoto/St. Louis Cardinals"><figcaption>Taka Yanagimoto/St. Louis Cardinals</figcaption></figure><p>From the moment I set foot in Batavia, New York, with our short-season A ball club in 2009, I knew that I needed to hit the ground running. The good news was, I felt I was around the smartest people in all of baseball. But then I went to the Quad Cities, and it’s funny, as soon as I get there I’m like,<em> No, THESE guys are the smartest people in all of baseball. </em>And each stop along the way it was like that. I knew I needed to soak all of this up. I had a burning desire to be the best player I could be, and I was surrounded by great baseball minds that could help me achieve that. I was fully engulfed in “the Cardinal way.”</p><p>Quick story about my first MLB game. It was June 4, 2011. I had just got the call the night before that I was headed to the big leagues. We were a couple games up on the Brewers for the division lead and we had a weekend series at home against the Cubs. Tony La Russa put me in the lineup Saturday after we won the opener Friday. I’m looking around the clubhouse at guys like Albert, Yadi, Matt Holliday, Lance Berkman … all these legends. It was surreal. The game goes pretty well, it’s a close one, I get my first hit — a double off Kerry Wood. Didn’t make any big mistakes. All good. </p><p>And then in the 12th, Albert walks it off with a bomb. The place goes nuts. It’s the coolest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.</p><p>I’m watching <em>Albert Pujols</em> run around the bases toward <em>me </em>after walking off the Chicago Cubs.</p><p>It took me hours to fall asleep that night. I just kept replaying every moment over in my head.</p><p>So I come back the next day, and I’m in the lineup again. Another close game. Packed house on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. </p><p>And guess what?</p><p>I mean, you already know.</p><p>He does it <em>again</em>.</p><p>In the 10th, Albert walks it off with a homer. </p><p>The roar is even louder. Albert is flyin’ around the bases, he’s high-stepping from third to home. It’s unbelievable, man. I felt like I’d died and gone to heaven. I left the stadium that night … and all I wanted was to experience that feeling over and over and over again. I don’t know if there’s a certain day that I fell in love with St. Louis, or something like that, but that weekend I knew there wasn’t a better ball club for me to be a part of. This place was special.</p><blockquote>I left the stadium that night … and all I wanted was to experience that feeling over and over and over again.<cite>Matt Carpenter</cite></blockquote><p>I remember watching from home that year when David Freese became a hero, and I swear I was just like y’all — jumping off my couch, screaming at the ball to get over Cruz’s head, the whole deal. It was awesome. And getting to experience that run as a player and a fan, I think it just gave me extra motivation to help this city have more of those kinds of moments. </p><p>That’s really all I’ve ever wanted to do, you know? During my 11 years wearing the birds on the bat, all I’ve wanted is to work my tail off for you guys, and represent you all in a way that made you feel proud. And I hope I did that. </p><p>I think that’s what so many of the guys in our clubhouse want. Guys like Yadi, who — man, how lucky are we to have Yadi? I wish you all could see him from behind the scenes. What he puts his body through to compete like he does ... it’s even more remarkable than what you’ve already seen. He represents the best of Cardinal Nation. Guys like Waino, who I mean, come on!! He might pitch forever, a Cardinals treasure. I’m so grateful to all the amazing teammates I’ve had while I was here. I’ve really been blessed to have some great people around me, both on and off the field. This city, this club, it’s been everything to me. </p><p>And that’s why I’m so glad I was able to start my family here, too. I got married as a Cardinal. Had two kids in this uniform. My daughter was even born during a Cubs-Cardinals series. Being able to bring my wife and kids down on the field for my last game at Busch Stadium, it was special. They’re pretty young, so they might not totally get it. But just to have them down there, to show them a place that meant so much to their dad — I’ll remember that forever. They do know one thing though, and that’s for sure.  </p><p>No matter where we go next, St. Louis is and always will be home.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fkyc0dx5516hqmmnwr.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Taka Yanagimoto/St. Louis Cardinals"><figcaption>Taka Yanagimoto/St. Louis Cardinals</figcaption></figure><p>I’ve tried to soak up these last few months as best as I could. I knew the end might be coming, and I wanted to really feel every last moment I had as a Card. The things that had become monotonous, like the pregame stretch or batting practice, I tried to pretend it was my first ball game again. I looked around the stadium as much as I could, taking mental pictures at every step along the way. Man ... just thinking about what an honor this has been. </p><p>Just thinking about what an honor it’s been to have represented <em>this city</em>. </p><p>Thank you to our ownership, to our front office, to every single worker at Busch Stadium: You guys really make it the best home field in the world, and the best organization in all of sports. And to Cardinal Nation: Y’all are unmatched. The love you showed, not only in St. Louis, but wherever we went … incredible. Really incredible. Thank you. We shared it all together — the postseason, the curtain calls, the walkoffs. We even shared the salsa. </p><p>We shared a lot of incredible moments together. I’ll remember all of them. </p><p>And I’ll remember the feeling I had every time I put on the Cardinal jersey: gratitude. </p><p>I love you, St. Louis. </p><p>—Matt</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_vDGYKce5FE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fkyce3mramry79y9gg.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>MLB</category></item><item><title>It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/carli-lloyd-uswnt-soccer-retirement?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Carli Lloyd</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fjw7dsvvfe</guid><description>Carli Lloyd says goodbye to soccer: “How can I sum up what 17 years actually feels like, and what it means to me?”</description><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:58:27 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjwk5c20racvw3f0z8.jpg" caption="Ira L.

As a matter of fact, I actually keep a list of these little digs in the Notes app on my phone. It’s a long one. In my 17 years playing this beautiful game at the professional level, I’ve heard so many ugly things. A lot of athletes will tell you that they ignore the comments. That the words don’t sting. That it’s all just white noise. Well, I’m telling you now, as I prepare to say goodbye, that some of those words hurt me deeply. </p><p>I am — and I know this might come as a shock to some people — a human being. I’ve felt every emotion you can feel in this game. I’ve felt the highest highs, but I’ve also been sad, anxious, depressed, devastated, defeated. I’ve felt not worthy. I’ve felt misunderstood. I’ve felt <em>everything</em>. </p><p>And it’s funny because I know that when people hear the name Carli Lloyd, they probably think about someone who is ice cold. A killer. Maybe even a robot. But that’s not me. That’s never been me. I feel like <em>that </em>Carli Lloyd, the killer, was almost like a mask that I had to put on in order to survive all the things that were being thrown my way. </p><p>The thing the grown-ups don’t tell you when you’re a kid with a dream is that it’s not really about the ball. That’s the easy part. The game is the game. But the <em>other </em>game? The one that happens off the field? That game is a whole different beast. The politics, the media, the favoritism, the fakeness, the jealousy, the opinions, the travel, the empty hotel rooms, the loneliness, the unrelenting grind, the injuries, the slights, the disappointments….</p><p>It’s only a matter of time. Eventually, this game will break you. </p><p>The question — maybe the only question that matters — is whether or not you’re able to use the pain and the heartbreak as fuel. </p><blockquote>Eventually, this game will break you. <cite>Carli Lloyd</cite></blockquote><p>I’ll never forget when I had a meeting with my first coach on the USWNT before the 2007 World Cup and he asked me what my goals were. And at that point, I was still a kid. A nobody. A bench player. I think I had scored once in my first 24 matches. And so, my coach asked me, “What’s your goal?” </p><p>I said, “I want to become the best player in the world.” </p><p>He just started chuckling. He thought I was either joking or delusional. And I don’t know why, but that moment really marked me. It made me realize how people saw me. I was never “in the plans.” I was never meant to be in the spotlight or on the cover of the magazines. I certainly was never meant to be the face of U.S. women’s soccer. </p><p>I was supposed to be a squad player. I was supposed to be a below average player. I was never meant for greatness, in the eyes of a lot of people. </p><p>I was just Carli Lloyd. Laser focused, with a chip on my shoulder, trying to prove people wrong. I made it my mission in life to make every single person eat their words. To do the impossible.   </p><p>It&#39;s so surreal to me now when people show me all this love. When I see little girls holding up my jersey in the crowd. Or when I see people call me one of the GOATs, one of the legends of this game. A decade ago, I was so far away from that. </p><p>I had just missed my PK in the 2011 World Cup final, and then I’d gotten benched right before the 2012 London Olympics. In that moment, I actually thought my national team career was over. The coaching staff was doubting me. I was bottling up everything inside, not talking to anyone about the pressure I was feeling. And then one day I was doing a workout in the gym in my garage, and out of nowhere, I just started bawling. Everything became too overwhelming, and I broke. I probably cried for two or three days out in that garage, going through my workouts all alone, feeling like my time was up. </p><p>The fear of not knowing my future was eating away at my core.</p><p>But I still kept getting up every morning when the alarm went off. I kept dragging myself into the garage, onto the field and onto the track. I kept training three times a day before I left for London. Sometimes I was sobbing, feeling worthless, feeling like I was done. But I kept putting one foot in front of the other. I stayed the course.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjwmt31yevb4psrcan.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Catherine Ivill/FIFA via Getty Images"><figcaption>Catherine Ivill/FIFA via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And that’s the thing. I truly don’t think people understand the sacrifices involved in pursuing greatness, especially in sports,<em> </em>especially in soccer. It’s a trade-off. And it’s not a very fair one. You trade literally everything in your life — your significant other, your friends, your family, your free time, anything else you ever loved to do — and in return you get the chance to <em>maybe</em>, if everything goes right, represent your country in a World Cup or an Olympics every four years. </p><p>I put all my chips in. I had just turned 30. And it looked like it was over. </p><p>The only reason that my journey turned out the way it did was because of an injury.  Shannon Boxx went down 16 minutes into the first match at the Olympics against France, and Pia called me off the bench. I didn’t even have a second to warm up. I had to seize the opportunity. This was my moment. This was my turning point. I never looked back from that point on. In fact, I never came off the field again in that tournament. </p><p>The rest, as they say, is history. I scored two goals in the final and we won gold.  Three years later, at the World Cup, I scored a hat trick in the final against Japan, and all of a sudden, people were calling me “the GOAT.” I was America’s hero. I was in the spotlight. On the magazine covers. The late-night shows. I was this person that everyone wanted to talk to, overnight. </p><p>And it’s still so surreal to me, because three years before that, I was in my garage crying my eyes out, feeling like I was a failure, feeling like the dream was over.</p><p>I was not <em>supposed </em>to be who I became. </p><p>It wasn’t in the script. </p><p>And that’s what made it all so sweet. </p><blockquote>Three years before that, I was in my garage crying my eyes out, feeling like I was a failure<cite>Carli Lloyd</cite></blockquote><p>You know, it’s really hard to say goodbye. It’s tough to find the right words. I’ve thought a lot about what I wanted to leave everybody with, as I prepare to pull on this national team jersey one last time. How can I sum up what 17 years actually feels like, and what it means to me?</p><p>The word that I keep coming back to is <em>hard</em>. </p><p>Hard. </p><p>It wasn’t a fairy tale.</p><p>It was really freaking hard. </p><p>And that’s the thing….</p><p>People see the glory. They see the parades. But they don’t see everything that goes into it. </p><p>Every single woman who pulls on that USWNT jersey and represents their country, they have sacrificed things that you wouldn’t imagine. We give our lives over to this game. Personally, I have gone through a lot of tough times. I have witnessed people close to me take advantage of me for their own benefit, I have been brainwashed and manipulated by some, and I even became separated from my family for 12 years — missing out on so many things. I pissed a lot of people off for being true to myself and not following the crowd. For not saying all the right things. I read and heard a lot of really hurtful things. I cried a lot of tears. </p><p>I put off starting a family. I put off having any semblance of a normal life. I gave every ounce of myself to this game for 17 straight years — never ever switching off. </p><p>And you know what? I would do it all again. In an instant. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2198,h_1465,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjwwpnhem71hvx803d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images"><figcaption>Atsushi Tomura/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Call me what you will. </p><p>Selfish. </p><p>Complicated. </p><p>Infuriating. </p><p>A black hole. </p><p>The weirdest world-class athlete ever. </p><p>Say whatever you want.

I enjoyed playing for the Cubs, enjoyed the city, enjoyed Wrigley….. plus I’d already changed teams <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/joc-pederson-los-angeles-dodgers-mlb-baseball" target="_blank">last offseason</a>. I wasn’t exactly dying to do it twice in a year. So when I saw Jed’s name pop up on my caller I.D. over the All-Star break, my heart kind of sank a little. We’d been losing, and I’d heard the same rumors as everyone else — that the Cubs were going to be sellers.</p><p>Turns out the rumors were true. Jed thanked me for my time with the club, and told me that the Braves had come after me hard. So they were moving me to Atlanta.</p><p><em>Atlanta???</em> Man, I was pretty surprised. At the time, the Braves were a game under .500. They were third in the division — 4½ back. And they’d just lost Acuña, an MVP–caliber player, for the rest of the season. In my mind, I was thinking, you know, <em>No offense.… but shouldn’t these guys be sellers, too??</em> I actually remember one of the first things that somebody said to me when I got there: “Don’t get too comfortable.”</p><p>Translation: <em>If things don’t turn around, you might be getting traded all over again.</em></p><p>Slowly but surely, though….. things turned around.</p><p>It wasn’t anything crazy at first. No huge winning streak out of the gate. No dramatic changes. It wasn’t like in the movies where the music hits and the team just rips off a bunch of W’s. It was more of a gradual thing, you know what I mean? It’s like at some point we just started winning a little more than we were losing.</p><p>And then it’s funny — I remember about a month after the trade, we’re a few games over .500 and on a long road trip. And I was playing cards on the plane with some of the pitchers. The plane ride ended, and then from there it’s like, the team has two buses: one for pitchers and one for position players. I wanted to keep playing cards with those guys, though — so I hopped in with them instead. And we’re on the bus, playing cards, talking trash, you know….. when at some point someone asks me, “Wait. Why are you on the pitchers bus?” And I wasn’t really even thinking about it. We were just having a good time, I guess, and I was in one of those moods.</p><p>But I said: “Because y’all are the motherf*ckers who are going to win us a World Series.”</p><p>I think we won like six games in a row after that.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjy3q7dzymfpncmwp1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images"><figcaption>Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And I’m bringing that story up, not because I’m trying to say that that’s what jump-started all of this. Obviously not. We’re here because this is one hell of a baseball team — and guys have been playing great when it’s mattered most.</p><p>But I also think, in terms of looking at success, that sometimes some of the “other stuff” can be underrated.</p><p>Like…. baseball seasons are <em>long</em>, man. They’re a serious grind. Things can get stale. And I think over the course of a long season, it’s stuff like culture, like swagger, like vibes, like whatever you want to call it — it’s stuff like that that can actually make a pretty big difference. Stuff like that can get everybody’s energy right.</p><p>And if there’s one thing that I think I’ve been able to bring to this team, beyond just my bat and my glove, I’d say it’s that energy — and that belief: That nothing is as dangerous in baseball as a team with a ton of confidence.</p><blockquote>Y’all are the motherf*ckers who are going to win us a World Series.<cite>Joc Pederson</cite></blockquote><p>I’ll give you another example real quick. So we’re in L.A. for a series near the end of the summer — and my wife has this great stylist there who comes to the house to do hers and the kids’ hair. And since I’m around, the stylist asks if I want to do anything with mine. I probably would have just said no.… but then I remember something. </p><p>So, back when I was in Chicago, <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/arizzo" target="_blank">Rizzo</a> had this idea: that halfway through the year, we needed to go blonde. “Trust me, good things happen when you go blonde.” Not sure if he fact-checked that, or where it came from, but he’d always be saying it. Then I got traded, though, and he did too, so it never happened. But now flash-forward — it’s late August, I’m kind of grinding, not hitting like I should be….. and I remember the blonde thing with Rizzo. So I’m like, alright — why not. I tell my wife’s hair stylist, “Let’s switch it up.” Went blonde.</p><p>The guys in the bullpen saw it, and had my walk-up song changed to “The Real Slim Shady.” The fans caught on to it, and of course did their thing. The whole team got a kick out of it. And then also….. it kind of <em>worked???</em></p><p>Very next game, I hit a home run off Buehler.</p><p>Rizzo texts me right after, thrilled — as if I proved his theory, and we discovered a major breakthrough in science or something. And I’m not saying we did…...</p><p>But at the same time: It really has just been <em>that</em> kind of season, man.</p><p>Like, it’s been an incredible run — game in, game out. It’s been so many different guys stepping up in so many different moments. It’s been us getting MVP–type seasons from Albies and Riley. It’s been Soler legitimately carrying us for stretches. It’s been Freddie taking Hader deep to send us to the NLCS. It’s been Adrianza coming through with that pinch-hit double.… then Eddie hitting the bomb that changed everything. It’s been Matzek, in an elimination game, giving us two of the most ridiculous shutdown innings you’ll ever see. It’s been Will slamming the door on some of the best lineups in baseball. It’s been <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/dswanson" target="_blank">Dansby</a> flashing the glove to get that final out. It’s been the entire pitching staff, frankly. </p><p>It’s been championship-level baseball, up and down the roster.</p><p>But when I look back on these last few months, and when I look ahead to this World Series in front of us — what stands out to me, just as much, is the little things. </p><p>What stands out to me is the stuff that you can’t see in a box score. </p><p>It’s the front office believing in this group just crazily enough to be buyers at the trade deadline with a team that was under .500. It’s our security guys coming up to me during my very first batting practice, and saying how glad they were to have me on board. It’s Ian Anderson convincing me to change my walk-up music to “Way 2 Sexy,” and then promising, “It’s gonna bang.” It’s the white pearls becoming….. whatever the white pearls have become (shoutout to Gabe, my jeweler). It’s “Wine Club,” this thing that me and a few guys have started, where after each big playoff win we’ll crack open a new bottle. It’s Poppy, my three-year-old daughter, running out onto the field after we clinched the pennant and letting me know, “Dada, the Braves won! You played good defense!” It’s a couple of former teammates I’m really close to, coming up to me postgame and saying, “Hey — I love you. Now go beat the Astros for us.” </p><p>And it’s the city of Atlanta, being absolutely electric, every single night at Truist, and matching our energy when we’ve needed it most.</p><p>Obviously I don’t know what’s coming next — it’s impossible to predict what’s going to happen over these next four, five, six, seven games.</p><p>I like our chances, though.</p><p>Because, yeah — we might not be a superteam. We might have only won 88 games. We might have had our share of injuries, and slipped below some people’s radars, and taken an unconventional path to get to this stage.</p><p>But we also <em>just might be</em> those motherf*ckers.</p><p>And no one’s beat us yet.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjy41hsawns60550fw.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>MLB</category></item><item><title>Addiction </title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/colin-wilson-nhl-hockey-addiction?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Colin Wilson</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fjn0z7z0wt</guid><description>Colin Wilson opens up: “When I shared my story here last year, I was holding something back.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 12:57:06 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjn1q9yyvyz2nmkc8m.jpg" caption="Cody Glenn/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Colin Wilson"></flatplan:author><keywords>NHL,colin wilson ,Hockey</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wasn’t fully honest with you.</p><p>When I shared <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/colin-wilson-nhl-hockey-mental-health" target="_blank"><u>my story here</u></a> last year, I was holding something back.</p><p>I opened up about my OCD. My retirement from hockey. My successes and my failures. But I left something out. And I justified it in my head because I didn’t want it to dilute my message — or my goal to help<em> </em>people. I told myself it wouldn’t make sense, that it wasn’t necessary. But I was lying to myself. The truth is … man, the truth is simple: I was <em>ashamed</em>. Deeply ashamed. I held it close, scared of what people might think of me.</p><p>The truth is, I was an addict.</p><p>And when I saw the story in <em>The Boston Globe</em> about Jimmy Hayes’ autopsy, everything that I’d suppressed about my own addiction came flooding into my mind. I’m two-and-a-half years sober — and in a way, I guess, I thought I had beat it. But you never beat it. You just live with it. And what happened to Jimmy … it could have happened to any of us. It could have happened to <em>me</em>. </p><p>I texted his dad and his wife, Kristen, the morning that article came out, and I let them know how powerful it was — how brave they were to share what they did. I’ve known Jimmy since I was 16, and he was a great, <em>great</em> person. Everyone cared about him so much. I can’t speak highly enough of the Hayes family. They are all great people.  And I know they want to help, just like I do. Because we’re in the middle of a massive opioid and mental health crisis. Those two things are inherently connected. And I believe the first step toward change is honesty and vulnerability. </p><p>I let myself down the last time I did this. I won’t do it again.</p><p>So this is my truth.</p><p>In October 2018, I was lost. And for those of you who didn&#39;t read my first story, I can give an extremely quick recap here, because I think it’s important.</p><p>I’ve had OCD for as long as I can remember. </p><p>It’s a severe case that impacted my life, my hockey career and everything in between. I had these intrusive thoughts that pushed me into dark corners of my mind, where I no longer knew who I was, or what I wanted to be. </p><p>And it ultimately led to what came next. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjten7r42fmf6cz5cc.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Chris Brown/Cal Sport Media via AP Images"><figcaption>Chris Brown/Cal Sport Media via AP Images</figcaption></figure><p>I was with the Colorado Avalanche in 2018, and my OCD had completely taken over my life. It had driven this deep hole inside of me. This void. I didn’t feel normal. I hadn’t felt normal in a long time. When I was around other people — even my friends — I couldn’t relate to them. Because I knew their mind wasn’t at war with itself like mine was. Whatever they had, whatever sense of self-worth they felt ... it didn’t exist in me. I would look over people’s heads, or at their shoulders when I spoke to them, because eye contact scared me. I didn’t want to see them, to see how normal they were — to see what I couldn’t be. I felt blessed to have the life I did as an NHL player. I really did. But it isolated me even more. I was Colin, the guy who <em>made </em>it. </p><p>I was constantly searching for something to block my pain. To make me feel good. For peace.</p><p>I was put onto Ambien when I was just 20, and it became this crutch in my life. I couldn’t sleep without it. And if I couldn’t sleep, I couldn’t play like I wanted to. My career — my <em>everything</em> — was tied to this pill. I wouldn’t call it addictive … but it was an introduction to an abusive relationship to a remedy. I was vulnerable, and Ambien instilled in me this idea that, my regular self? The one who tries to go to sleep sober? There’s something wrong with him.</p><blockquote>My regular self? The one who tries to go to sleep sober? There’s something wrong with him.<cite>Colin Wilson</cite></blockquote><p>I tried a more therapeutic option in weed when I was 22, and I found something I’d never felt before: Normalcy. I remember, as the high rolled through me, I wondered, <em>Is this how everyone feels? </em>My OCD, my intrusive thoughts — they’d fade into the background when I was high. I called weed my best friend because it <em>truly</em> felt like when I was smoking I was with a friend I never knew I had. </p><p>But weed couldn’t save me from what was happening in my brain. My OCD was growing, evolving. And as I got older and further into my career, nights out became traps. </p><p>Look, if I’m going to do this…. This is where I need to be honest. </p><p>I feel like people don’t want to have this conversation. </p><p>But, man — to me?</p><p>This <em>is</em> the conversation.  </p><p>When I used to go out, it felt like there was cocaine everywhere.</p><p>It seemed like when I was out for the night in NYC or L.A. or Vegas, somebody always had cocaine.</p><p>So, when I was 22, I did it. Because like so many cocaine users, I was just a lost kid who wanted to feel something. What I wanted to feel, what I <em>needed</em> to feel, might be different from the guy beside me. But there it was, right in front of me — offering me control over my mind, my feelings, if just for the night. I didn’t do it often at first. Once or twice per year. But by the time I was 28, I was doing it every few weeks. And those nights ruined me. Because those nights became the only ones when I could feel anything. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjtf6wmj2z7dbjx1w1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Bruce Bennett/Getty Images"><figcaption>Bruce Bennett/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>What they don’t tell you about cocaine, or ecstasy or any similar drugs, is that they undo years of your brain’s wiring in seconds. The chemicals released in our mind when we succeed, when we fall in love, when we have that amazing moment — cocaine and other drugs will bypass all that and release them immediately. It hammers on that button, that feel-good button, and it presses it a thousand times a minute. Buttons that should only be pressed a few times a week, or a month. It hijacks our natural physiology.</p><p>And if you have deficits in these parts of your brain, from either past traumas or underlying mental health issues, and if you never really get those buttons pushed naturally?</p><p>Man….</p><p>Cocaine makes it so you finally feel like you’ve come home. </p><p>Like you’re finally feeling what everyone <em>else</em> is feeling. </p><p>Love. Life. </p><p>Peace. </p><p>But it ends. And it hits you square in the chest. Like I said, those nights ruined me. I’d be so afraid of the comedown that I’d bring a sleeping pill with me to the club. Xanax or Seroquel. I’d take it before I got home so I could just fall asleep. It was such an awful cocktail of drugs and alcohol that I’d be in a cab home, and I’d look out the window and think….</p><p><em>Am I going to wake up tomorrow?</em></p><p>I had one of those nights earlier in my career. </p><p>I wrote a note in my journal in case I didn’t wake up. </p><p>I don’t remember doing it. </p><p>But … man, it just breaks me up thinking about myself in that moment.</p><p><em>How could I do that to myself?</em></p><p>I just ... I was just an addict. I was in the NHL. I was scoring goals. Playing in a Cup final. Living a dream. But I was an <em>addict</em>. And I didn’t even know I had a problem. <em>I only party every couple weeks, </em>I’d tell myself. I’d go weeks without doing anything, then I’d start back up and I’d get afraid of who I’d become when it got dark — when my mind needed peace. It was a slow process. It was insidious. But at some point I crossed this invisible line where I couldn’t find the off switch anymore. I couldn’t curb the feeling of wanting to be high. </p><blockquote>I wrote a note in my journal in case I didn’t wake up. <cite>Colin Wilson</cite></blockquote><p>In October 2018, I had another one of those nights. </p><p>It’s the last one I ever had. </p><p>I had it all in my system. Alcohol. Coke. Sleeping pills. More than ever before. And I had a practice the next morning. I almost never did that. But that night, for whatever reason, I couldn’t take it — my life, my mind, everything. I knew the light would come, and the dark would fade, and morning would bring hell. </p><p>Hell. </p><p>That’s the only way I could describe waking up that next morning. <em>Hangover </em>doesn’t even come close. I hadn’t taken anything in over eight hours and I couldn’t see straight. I could barely see my hand in front of my face. Walking into the rink … I thought I was going to pass out. I decided right there that I couldn’t do it anymore. There was no alternative. I was going to talk to our coach, Jared Bednar, and I was going to tell him everything. I was going to get help. </p><p>But a few minutes after I got to the rink, our coaches said practice was optional.</p><p>I turned around, went home, and went straight back to bed.</p><p>I didn’t end up getting help until the end of that season. </p><p>I fought my mind so damn hard the rest of that year. </p><p>I’m lucky I didn’t end up having another night like that. And it <em>was</em> luck. Because I wasn’t in control that year. I hadn’t been in control in a long time. If I had another night like that…. I don’t know, man. I don’t know. </p><p>I’m lucky to be here today. I do know that. </p><p>There are a lot of people who had nights like that, and they aren’t here. </p><p>Addiction is a beast.</p><p>It’s a monster. </p><p>The rise of fentanyl has completely changed what drug addiction means. The most vulnerable in our communities, the ones who are feeling an insurmountable pain and have limited options to cope — fentanyl preys on them. </p><p>Addiction, to so many, is just this <em>thing</em>. It’s the word we say to put a group of people in a box that we don’t understand.</p><p>We see the guy on the street corner shooting up heroin, and we just say in our heads, <em>Oh, he’s an addict. </em><br/></p><p>It’s so much more complicated than that. I know, man, I lived it. I was a regular person just like you. But I got hooked, I got stuck. I didn’t know the way out. I wish I could have said “no” more often, but when you just want relief … “no” doesn’t make any sense to your brain. And I don’t know if that would have even helped. I was just susceptible to it all. I know I have to take blame for how things turned out. I get that. And trust me, nobody is harder on me than me. I just don’t want anyone out there, anyone struggling, to think it’s <em>their</em> fault. </p><p>I’m telling you right now that it’s not.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjtfk1vdt5qfkcsp0k.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Michael Martin/NHLI via Getty Images"><figcaption>Michael Martin/NHLI via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>For me, the way out was hard.

They’ve helped me so much. I’m so thankful to all those who played a role in my recovery. They do so much for so many guys. </p><p>But I do think the league, all major leagues, can do more around what’s happening right now. Sports are just a microcosm of society, and we can all play a part in this. </p><p>And we need to call it what it is. It’s a crisis. </p><p>By the end of December, there will have been more than 100,000 overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2021.

We have to do more to really understand what addiction is, and how it works. I’m not writing this to say that all addicts are victims, I know there is a responsibility on us to take the right course of action. But these substances, there’s a person behind them. A son, a daughter.

I don’t want them to be ostracized by their community, to be left out in the cold. I think our society is making really great strides around mental health and its importance. But, to me, addiction is just as important a frontier. Of course, they are connected, as I said before. Both aren’t clear to see, and both require empathy and patience and love. We need more of all those things. </p><p>I don’t want my role in this battle to just be words. That’s why I’m at school in Boston right now — I’m working toward getting my degree in psychology. I want to be on the front lines. I want to be on the battlefield. What I put myself through ... it can’t be for nothing. I won’t let it be. I am still working <em>every day </em>to survive it. Addiction is for life. And so I’m going to use it now. I want to make a difference. I know I can. </p><p>I just really felt like I had to do this after what Jimmy’s parents did. They are heroes for that. The world needs more people like them, and it needs more people like Jimmy. He was caring, genuine and an incredible friend. I never knew I could feel this type of aching pain until Jim passed. We are all going to miss him.</p><p>So I hope you’ll forgive me for leaving out my addiction. </p><p>I’m still learning. I’m still working toward my peace. This is a part of my story. </p><p>But I hope you know that this wasn’t the story of a bad person. This wasn’t the story of someone who should have known better. This was the story of someone who couldn’t find peace. </p><p>And I know I’m just one of many.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjtdr1cvht3wy6jnng.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>NHL</category></item><item><title>Chicago!!!

I mean, I know we just won a WNBA championship — but it still hasn’t fully set in for me yet. Hasn’t set in yet that we THE CHAMPS. The <em>champs</em>. It’s crazy. We HERE.   </p><p>And I won’t lie.… it’s been a long road for me to get to this point.</p><p>It all starts in North Philly. Like, if you ever want to know why I play with so much intensity, well I got two words for ya: North Philly. Right on 32nd and Berks. Both of my grandmas lived close by, and since we didn’t have a court, it was only one thing we could do — create one. At first, we played with a crate as the basket. But eventually somebody (I don’t even remember who, but somebody) stole a rim from the park and we used that instead. </p><p>North Philly is <em>different</em>. It’s a place I love, the place where I learned how to play tough. Being on that makeshift court, the boys would let me play — but that means I had to <em>play. </em>They weren’t going to take it easy on me. And I didn’t want them to. </p><p>Early on, I wasn’t really thinking about the WNBA. It just wasn’t on my mind in a serious way until I got to Rutgers. That’s when I realized that Coach Stringer’s program <em>breeds</em> pros. I immediately jumped on the bandwagon. My goal became to get my picture on the wall of the locker room where the pros were — because that means you MADE IT. </p><p>But I knew I had to work my way up — I knew I had to start <em>living</em> in the gym.<em> </em>I would get up at 5 a.m. with my teammate Tyler Scaife, and we’d be getting that work in. After that workout we would eat, relax, and then 12 o’clock would hit and we’d go play pickup with guys at Werblin. Then we’d head back to the gym that night. We were grindin’, man. </p><p>And the grind paid off. </p><p>I got drafted by the Mystics — and I enjoyed playing with them, and for Coach T. I was coming off the bench, but I think I played pretty well. Then one day I’m overseas…. and I get a call from Coach T. </p><p><em>Damn.</em> I’m traded. Now I have to pack up and move to Chicago.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3262,h_2174,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjjdwg08j2nz2b7m06.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I was completely starting over.</p><p>And yet the minute I arrived, it felt like <em>home</em>. Philly is the city forreal — so when I got to Chicago, just seeing the skyscrapers and the neighborhoods and how it reminded me of Philly, I was so grateful for that. I embraced the city, and it embraced me back, which made the transition so much easier. </p><p>Those first few seasons though with the Sky I was super quiet haha. I was still just trying to figure it all out, and I wasn’t playing. I was getting humbled..... and truthfully, I’d already been humbled so many times. It was hard.</p><p>But I understood my role. And the biggest question I had to ask myself was, <em>If you’re not coming off the bench….. then what are you bringing to the team? </em></p><p>I figured out that one of the best things for me was to bring some <em>life</em> to the team. At that point it was kind of a dead energy — like they just weren’t having the vibes yet. Nobody was dancing or doing that cool stuff that makes a team’s personality show. So, that’s when I became kind of the organizer of Sky handshakes. I started coming up with all types of secret handshakes with everybody, and just bringing some excitement to the team. It wasn’t the biggest role, but taking it on was big for me, because I knew it helped in some way. And eventually the minutes followed.</p><p>Then comes 2019, and I’m a free agent….. so I’m wondering what’s next. </p><blockquote>If you’re not coming off the bench….. then what are you bringing to the team? <cite>Kahleah Copper</cite></blockquote><p>Coach Wade and I go to a cafe downtown to talk about the upcoming season. He starts by saying that he wants me to come back, and to get ready to play a bigger role on the team. That’s exactly what I wanted to hear — because I was READY. Like, don’t get me wrong, I didn’t complain about not playing more minutes. But Coach Wade knew I wanted more for myself. And so did he.</p><p>Then COVID hits, and puts a pause on everything.</p><p>And by the time the bubble season got started….. that was tough. A lot of heavy feelings. A lot of mixed emotions. But I knew it was my opportunity to show the league what I could do. I went out there and had what some people would probably call a “breakout season.”</p><p>But I still wasn’t satisfied. Offseason comes, and I’m already thinking of things to improve on. Finishing at the rim, passing better, defending better — anything to help this team get to the next level. </p><p>Then Candace comes….. and everything changed after that. </p><p>I mean, EVERYTHING. She immediately started challenging me in practice. <em>Run harder, cut harder, get a stop on D</em>. Everything you could think of, she was challenging me to do it. </p><p>And I accepted the challenge — because, let’s be real: Who’s trying to disappoint Candace? </p><p>Nobody. </p><p>It’s so funny, because she said how she saw something special in me — and that she hated playing against me. I was like <em>what???</em> Candace Parker is saying she hated playing against <em>me???</em> I HATED PLAYING AGAINST <em>HER</em> haha.</p><p>I was always a fan of Candace’s on the court, but I didn’t know her much personally. The more I got to know her off the court, though, the more I got to know how amazing she is. She’s one of the most selfless people you could meet, and a real leader. The way she took me under her wing this season….. that meant a lot.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjjdmzxezmn4vz450z.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The regular season was tough for us. We started off 2–7, and it’s like we just couldn’t find that consistency. </p><p>It was frustrating…. and at the Olympic break we hit our breaking point. We were fed UP. And Coach must have been fed up, too — because he was WORKING us. Had us doing full-court one-on-ones, drills, everything. It was <em>crazyyy. </em>We wanted to kill each other…. hell we wanted to kill James haha. But that break made us know who we were. And it made us know the kind of team we could become.</p><p>Going into the playoffs, everyone was underestimating us. We knew it. </p><p>But we didn’t care. </p><p>All we cared about was that everyone was 0–0 now. Clean slate. So we wiped our minds clean, and got to work. </p><p>Those single-elimination games against Dallas and Minnesota, they were the best things that could’ve happened to us. I saw us lock in and have a sense of urgency I’d never seen in us before. Everyone was embracing their role on offense….. we were running new schemes on defense….. I&#39;m telling you, we were a <em>different team</em>. </p><p>I didn’t feel any jitters in the semis against Connecticut. It was a big moment, obviously — but I think we were just ready to compete. I don’t know how else to say it. It was like, <em>to get to the finals, we have to beat them.</em> So we beat them. Sometimes it’s hard but it’s simple.</p><p>And then in the finals….. O.K., that’s when I started to feel some jitters. Game 1, I was fine. But then Game 2 came — and literally, in the middle of the game, I’m thinking <em>what the heck are we doing???</em> We were all just beating ourselves.</p><p>And that game is also when the infamous Philly Kah picture was taken (big shoutout to Joe Camporeale, the photographer, because the picture is FIRE). I say that “Philly Kah” was in the photo because that’s almost like my alter ego that I can tap into when I’m on the court. Like, I’ll get fired up and then that <em>Philly</em> starts showing. I’m a different person — I’m ready to go. </p><p>And people can say what they want, but that’s just finals basketball. I’m trying to get an extra possession for my team, and I’m going to do whatever it takes. Even if that means sacrificing my body. I wasn’t trying to harm anyone, and I think everyone knew that. </p><p>But at the same time…. one thing I won’t allow is disrespect. </p><p>And when I got up from trying to get the ball, all I was trying to say there was, Hey, we’re all competing — that’s what the game is about. But <em>this ain&#39;t that.</em></p><p>Losing Game 2 like we did, it really flipped the switch for me and the team. It lit a fire, man. I’m always going to be frustrated about losing, but now I had a chip on my shoulder as well. </p><p>I went into Game 3 with a lot of passion and emotion. I found that raw energy — we all did. We got back to playing <em>Chicago Sky basketball.</em></p><p>And earned a damn W.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjjczvhhjczzfjyx1g.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Joe Camporeale/USA TODAY Sports"><figcaption>Joe Camporeale/USA TODAY Sports</figcaption></figure><p>The day before Game 4 is when I knew we’d be champions. </p><p>We were at the facility for film — and the minute film is over, it’s like: everybody’s <em>out of there</em>. But then right as I’m heading out, I see Allie walking onto the court. So I ask Sloot, you know, “What is she doing?”</p><p>“Oh. She said she’s about to shoot since there won’t be a shootaround tomorrow.”<em> </em></p><p>Yup — that’s when I knew. Because what Allie was up to, right then, that’s just what champions <em>do</em>. Everyone else is at home….. and one of the greatest shooters in the league is still in the gym getting her game-time shots up. </p><p>The crazy thing is, I couldn’t sleep at all that night. I guess Candace couldn’t sleep either — so me and her end up texting around 3 a.m., just about the game and how bad she wanted it. Seeing those texts really hit home for me, and I think gave me this energy of, <em>O.K…. we have to do whatever it takes to win this game.</em> I didn’t know how we would do it, and I didn’t care. All I could think about in that moment was how much Candace had sacrificed. How much she’d sacrificed to come to this team. And how much she’d sacrificed to show us how to win.</p><p>So now we had to win this for Candace and Chicago.</p><blockquote>Everyone else is at home….. and one of the greatest shooters in the league is still in the gym.<cite>Kahleah Copper</cite></blockquote><p>That day of Game 4, I’m texting everybody like, “Yo — are y’all eating??” Allie replies, “I can’t eat anything.” I’m like, <em>great…. at least I’m not the only one.</em> It was those kinds of nerves.</p><p>We were just <em>ready</em> for that game — and even though we fell behind in certain moments, we still had a calm and collected mood to us. We knew we were never out of it. Coach made a lot of boxing analogies during the playoffs, and in Game 4 we were exactly like a boxer: taking those hits, and giving ’em right back. </p><p>Oh yeah, and remember I told you how Allie was taking her game-time shots the day before? Well she showed up BIG in Game 4. Y’all saw her. She could not miss. That’s why we call her the greatest shooter, it’s games like that. We were down and out — Allie shot us back in.</p><p>And then once that clock hit zero….. <em>whew.</em></p><p>All I could think about was what we’d endured throughout the season. What we’d gone through to get to this moment of being champs. </p><p>Being in front of that crowd and feeling that energy in the arena was CRAZY. Y’all saw Chance wearing my jersey and just going wild for us. It was a surreal feeling. It’s something that I’m still trying to process. Because our team FOUGHT for this, you know what I mean? We fought all season for it. We believed in each other when nobody else believed in us. </p><p>It was Chicago against the world.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1432,h_954,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjje4s2y37h4dy7zk2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Shaina Benhiyoun/Sipa USA via AP Images)"><figcaption>Shaina Benhiyoun/Sipa USA via AP Images)</figcaption></figure><p>I said in our press conference that Coach Wade knew I’d be MVP before everybody else did — and I meant that. Coach, and everyone else on the Sky, they believed in me from the very beginning. They put all their confidence in me to do what I do on the court. So to get named the MVP of the WNBA finals.…. that’s a rewarding feeling. </p><p>And I hope that my success helps show that everyone’s success can be different. That you gotta celebrate other people — and sometimes you even gotta stay down until it’s your turn. But the work pays off. I worked <em>hard</em> for this moment. I <em>deserved</em> to raise those trophies. </p><p>I wouldn’t trade the road I took to get here for anything.</p><p>And now it’s a few days later, and I’m trying to think of how to put this all in words….. and I guess the way I look at it is: This team and this city, we showed up and showed out <em>for each other</em>. And we’re going to keep on doing that. We aren’t even close to finished.</p><p>So on that note, Chicago — y’all ready for another run at this thing??</p><p>We the CHAMPS, man<em>.</em> The <em>champs.</em></p><p>Tell ’em to move that sh*t out the way!!!</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjje95c6yw0tt9ncf3.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>WNBA</category></item><item><title>This Should Make You Uncomfortable</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/gwen-berry-olympics-usa-track-and-field-racial-injustice?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Gwen Berry</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fjaq72addg</guid><description>Gwen Berry on her protests, the importance of Black lives and why the IOC needs to change.</description><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 12:49:02 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2712,h_1525,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjfjj8yewntz0qckf1.jpg" caption="Becca Estrella/The Players’ Tribune"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Gwen Berry"></flatplan:author><keywords>USATF ,Team USA,running ,gwen berry </keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s the summer of 2019, and I’m representing Team USA at the Pan American Games in Peru. </p><p>I’d just won the hammer throw, which came down to the final throws, so initially I was riding high off that adrenaline. But by the time the medal ceremony came around, and I stepped up on that podium, something felt ... <em>off</em>. This was the biggest win of my career — if anything, I should’ve been extremely happy. But I wasn’t filled with pride to be standing at the top like I thought I’d be. </p><p>The thing is, the minute the national anthem started to play, I felt uneasy. </p><p>I’m on the podium, and I’m jittery. I’m swaying back and forth, the fatigue from the competition is finally catching up to me. And as I’m listening to the anthem, I&#39;m in my head thinking about all of these things — the song’s history, what it really stands for and <em>who</em> it’s really speaking to. I’m thinking about Michael Brown, and Laquon McDonald, and Freddie Gray. I&#39;m thinking about police brutality and cycles of violence and ... basically what it really costs to be Black in this country. Whether we really all have the same freedoms. </p><p>And eventually, I just think like, <em>You know what? This song doesn’t speak for me. This anthem doesn’t represent me. It’s hypocritical. </em></p><p>I decided I was going to be true to myself. I wasn’t going to respect something that disrespects people who look like me. </p><p>So, when the song reached, “... the land of the free and the home of the brave,”<em> </em>I slowly raised my fist in the air. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1692,h_2256,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjfhc199wx49fpr09n.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>I was put on probation for 12 months by the USOPC and the IOC for my protest. I was confused — and I was also enraged. I didn’t take away from anyone else on the podium. I didn’t attack anyone, and I didn’t disrespect anyone. </p><p>I used that moment, my moment, to let my voice be heard without having to say anything at all. </p><p>My own Olympic Committee didn’t fight for me. They just continued to enforce a rule that had silenced athletes for years. So, that was really, really hard to swallow. I felt like I was being punished for speaking up about something that has been swept under the rug for so long. And there was other backlash, too. I had to watch my career be defunded. I was losing financial support left and right, and if the racial justice organization Color Of Change had not stepped in to sponsor me, I would have been forced to quit the sport. </p><p>In the year that followed, however, I watched how quickly the world changed. </p><p>When George Floyd was killed by police in May 2020, it was like all of a sudden something clicked for people — something that they had maybe been ignoring their whole lives. It was like the world did a 180. People stopped and started paying attention to the issues that had always been there: police brutality, systemic racism, and the oppression of Black lives. </p><p>You know, the <em>very things</em> that were racing through my mind when I raised my fist that day in Lima.</p><p>The very things that <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/rematch-etan-thomas" target="_blank">John Carlos</a> and <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/articles/tommie-smith-remembering-muhammad-ali" target="_blank">Tommie Smith</a> were thinking about more than 50 years ago.</p><p>All of a sudden, white America “woke up.” And all of sudden, I started receiving apologies. But I wasn’t bitter about it. I got to use my platform with Color Of Change to make sure that athletes like me weren’t going to be punished anymore for our activism. </p><p>When the USOPC finally changed its rule against protesting, allowing all Team USA athletes to respectfully demonstrate in support of racial and social justice, all I could feel was relief. My sacrifice had been worth it. The sacrifices of those before me, across sports, had been seen and respected. My voice had been<em> heard</em>.</p><p>Well, at least that’s what I thought. </p><blockquote>All of a sudden, white America “woke up.” And all of sudden, I started receiving apologies.<cite>Gwen Berry</cite></blockquote><p>Flash-forward to the Olympic trials this year, and all that fell apart <em>quick</em>. </p><p>After fighting to make the team, I finished in third place and secured my ticket to Tokyo. I wasn’t even thinking about any kind of controversy, because I had been told the national anthem would not play while I was on the podium. Then as soon as I walked up onto the platform … what did I hear?</p><p>The anthem.</p><p>Here’s where it gets a little complicated. At the trials, the national anthem isn’t played during all of the podium ceremonies — it only plays once a day at a prescheduled time — and on this particular day, I guess that just happened to be during the medal ceremony for the hammer throw. But I can’t lie, I definitely felt targeted. How could I not? Part of the reason they even changed the rule to allow for protests in Tokyo was because of everything that went down with me back in 2019. It felt weird, and it hurt me. I’m on the podium thinking, <em>What should I do? Should I walk off? Should I leave? Should I step down? </em></p><p>We weren’t even at the real Games yet, so there weren&#39;t enough people in the stands to pay attention to any of it anyway. So instead of walking off I decided to stay there. I told myself to just chill. To breathe. </p><p>And as I’m trying to calm myself down, I’m turning each and every way. Just like in 2019, I’m jittery, trying to get my thoughts together, trying to contain my anger. But to the people watching on TV, because of the way the cameras were positioned, it looks like I&#39;m intentionally turning my back on the flag.</p><p>Towards the end of the ceremony, I raised my Activist Athlete T-shirt in the air as a reminder to <em>everyone </em>of what I stand for. A reminder to my fellow U.S. track and field athletes, to the fans, to anyone watching at home, that I’m always going to speak out.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1692,h_2256,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjfhdm3wwy14nay3zm.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>The backlash was pretty much immediate. It was like 2019 all over again. Conservative media was running <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/message-sent-berry-turns-away-from-flag-during-anthem">all these stories</a> like, GWEN BERRY TURNS BACK TO U.S. FLAG DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM AT OLYMPIC TRIALS. One story <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/gwen-berry-sponsor-defund-police">called me</a> the “flag-snubbing U.S. Olympian.” Representative Dan Crenshaw called for my removal from the U.S. Olympic team. </p><p>Experiencing the uproar that followed was <em>a lot</em>. All of my social media platforms were flooded with support from my teammates and fans, as well as attacks from the ignorant and opposed. </p><p>I was actually in Houston when I saw Ted Cruz’s comments about me. And by the way, I found it very hypocritical because here he was talking about me not facing the flag, when he literally went on vacation to Mexico while Texas was in a state of emergency during the ice storm last February. (Yeah, we still remember that, Ted!! So you can’t talk to me. You want to talk about standing for a song and a flag, but you don’t even care about the people you swore to protect and govern. Worry about that.) </p><p>While his comments led to a lot of negative backlash from trolls, part of the reason I speak out is to make people uncomfortable. I really want people to pay attention not just to me, but also to what I stand for.</p><p>Being an Olympian, it’s not just about <em>what</em> I represent, but <em>who</em> I’m representing. Who I’m speaking for. Who I’m a reflection of. When I stand on that podium, I am a reflection of teenage mothers. I am a reflection of Black women. I am a reflection of everyone who has had to overcome poverty. </p><p>When you&#39;re a Black mother, the trauma of seeing the murders of young men like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and countless others just hits you differently.</p><p>Knowing that my son, no matter how smart he is, no matter how bright he is, no matter how brilliant he is, there are people out there who will never, ever, <em>ever</em> see him as somebody who deserves to live and thrive in the world ... I know that any time I’m not around my son, he is at risk of being beaten, abused or even murdered by a system of white supremacy.</p><blockquote>When I stand on that podium, I am a reflection of teenage mothers. I am a reflection of Black women. I am a reflection of everyone who has had to overcome poverty. <cite>Gwen Berry</cite></blockquote><p>If you think those fears aren’t justified, if you still can’t see how Black lives are being targeted, then we obviously live in two separate Americas, or you’re willingly blind. I <em>had</em> to use my platform to speak on these issues because it doesn’t matter if I’m a two-time Olympian. It doesn’t matter that I’ve represented my country on international stages. </p><p>My country has shown me time and time again that it doesn&#39;t give a damn about my son. And it doesn’t give a damn about me. </p><p>So, yeah, the media can run with whatever narrative fits the agenda. Ted Cruz and whoever can turn this into their latest talking point. But this isn’t just a lil moment in the spotlight for me. I’m not looking for my 15 minutes of fame. I’d actually rather not have to deal with all this. Whatever you think about my protest ... listen, I’m just glad you’re <em>thinking </em>about it. That’s all I’m trying to do is raise people’s awareness and keep us on topic. Because as quickly as the world changed after George Floyd, it snapped back to normal. Police didn’t stop killing us, and as a country, we went back to business as usual. But Black people don’t have that same luxury, we can’t just turn the channel on the TV.</p><p>This is <em>real life</em>.</p><p>This is bigger than the Olympics. This shit is personal.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1692,h_2256,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjfhf8c5jm0y8bnn6v.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>Things didn’t go how I wanted in Tokyo — I didn’t make it onto the podium. But seeing Raven, my close friend, get up there and call attention to intersectional injustices in the LGBTQ+ and Black community made me so proud. We actually talked before about things to do and ways we could really try to use our moments to bring about change. So to see it actually happening was<em> everything</em>. </p><p>Honestly, I couldn’t be more proud. I know I helped plant that seed, and her just being like a younger sister to me, I’m glad that I was able to influence her in a positive way. </p><p>And how was Raven treated, even after <em>everything</em> we’ve been through this past year, and all the supposed growth we’ve had in sports? She was put under investigation by the IOC. Literally ridiculous. </p><p>It just goes to show that the IOC is made up of a bunch of corporate monsters. Frankly, I think they’re full of shit. They are part of the problem. Somehow, they’re there to oversee everybody else, but there&#39;s nobody to oversee them. Nobody checks them, even though they got a whole list of scandals to their name. How can that be right or fair?</p><p>But regardless of how trifling the IOC is, I’m very grateful to be in a position where I can use my platform to amplify the truth. </p><p>If people hear the name Gwen Berry and immediately think of the national anthem drama — if I’m not remembered for anything else — that’s O.K. with me. </p><p>But while you’re thinking about that, I want you to ask yourself a simple question. </p><p>Think back to what was playing when I raised my first: <em>“... the land of the free…..”</em></p><p>Ask yourself — after everything that’s happened, everything you’ve seen with your own eyes and everything you’ve heard about over the last couple years….</p><p>... Free for who?</p><p>For everybody?</p><p>I know the answer.

Whenever my mind goes back to that<em> </em>night in Amsterdam in 2019, I can find no other explanation. Man, think about it: We’re in a Champions League semifinal, we’re 3–0 down to Ajax on aggregate with 45 minutes left…. </p><p>… and then I score three<em> </em>goals in <em>one</em> half?</p><p>With my <em>left </em>foot??</p><p>And the winner comes <em>after</em> the final minute???</p><p>Come on, man.

It’s got like 750,000 views on the Spurs account on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tY5stQvwkBA" target="_blank">YouTube</a>, and 100,000 of them are probably mine. </p><p>You might have seen the <a href="https://youtu.be/Xxf04xN0Cyo" target="_blank"><u>interview</u></a> I gave Esporte Interativo after the game. They played back Jorge Iggor’s commentary of my third goal on Brazilian TV, and I just broke down in tears. I still<em> </em>get emotional thinking about it. There was something about his words and his passion that just summed up how I was feeling. But what <em>really</em> made me cry was all these moments that flashed in front of my eyes. I could see the time I fell off my bike when I was five years old, and when I hurt my big toe playing football in the streets. I could even recall flying a kite from my neighbour’s roof and setting off fireworks in his mailbox. (Sorry!!)</p><p>I also remembered six dark months in Paris, when I put my future in the hands of God. </p><p>Now, in one game, my faith had been rewarded a thousand<em> </em>times over. </p><p>And that was when I realised that all of these moments had led me to this miracle in Amsterdam. So now I want to share some of them with you here — plus one more that happened to me shortly after. Each one has been part of God’s plan for me. </p><p>Take one of them away, and the whole story falls apart. </p><h2><strong>THE HIGH-COURT JUDGE</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_749,h_499,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd31fce9aaj4tg18x.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Lucas Moura"><figcaption>Courtesy of Lucas Moura</figcaption></figure><p>When I was a kid, my parents had a disagreement about my “professional” career. I put that in quotation marks because I had only just started out. My mum thought that my dad was too focused on football. So my dad took a deep breath, raised his voice and said something that I’ll never forget. It was like he took on the authority of a high-court judge.</p><p>He said, “I don’t think you realise that our kid has the talent to become a professional footballer.”</p><p>Really, he said that. No pressure, huh?? </p><p>Later he came over to me. “Son, are you <em>sure </em>you want to go down this path?”</p><p>I said, “Dad, this is the only thing I know how to do.”</p><p>I <em>was </em>sure. People had always told me that I had something special. Also, I was on a mission to one day play for Brazil. I was a complete fanatic! I was five when Brazil played the ’98 World Cup final, and even though we lost 3–0 to France, I kept running around my neighbourhood with a flag around my head shouting “BRAZIL! BRAZIL!” By the time I was finished, the streets were cold and empty. Everyone else had gone home. </p><p>But it was hard, man. When I was 13 and joined the São Paulo academy, I cried for a week because I missed my parents so much. And when I was 17 and made my debut for the first team, away to Athletico Paranaense, I was so anxious. I had always been the shortest player on my teams, so I was worried about facing the big guys. From my vantage point they were like moving mountains. But as soon as I got onto the pitch, the fear went away. </p><p>After the game I made it official in my head like, <em>Now I can say that I’m a professional football player. </em>My dad was jumping all over the place. </p><p>After all those years, he had been proven right. </p><h2><strong>NEYMAR AND THE PRINCE</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd5yw51ew555419k2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Raul Sifuentes/LatinContent/Getty Images"><figcaption>Raul Sifuentes/LatinContent/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><em>Hahaaa.</em> Look at us. A head full of hair. And a trophy that meant a lot to me. </p><p>I had only made my debut for São Paulo five months before, and here I was playing at the South American U20 championship for <em>Brazil</em>, with <em>Neymar. </em>The atmosphere in that camp was sensational. And the talent? Man, it was unreal. </p><p>Neymar was already incredible. Some people compared us, which was a great honour for me. He’s an amazing guy with a massive heart. He’s one of the biggest stars in the world, but go to his house for dinner and he’ll treat you like a prince. </p><p>On the pitch, he has so much courage. He can screw up a dribble or miss a chance, but the next time he gets the ball he acts as if it never happened, you know? He’s not intimidated by his own mistakes. That’s a type of bravery I admire a lot. </p><h2><strong>THANK YOU, ROGÉRIO</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd63tdb52z008jdtt.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Nelson Almeida/AFP via Getty Images"><figcaption>Nelson Almeida/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>When I signed for PSG, I was obsessed with winning a trophy … with São Paulo. </p><p>This started in summer 2012, when I was close to signing for Manchester United. Their rep came to my house to talk about their plans, and I was very tempted. But at the last minute, Leonardo called me and convinced me to join PSG. They had Ibra, and a lot of Brazilians, like Thiago Silva, Alex, Maxwell and Thiago Motta.  </p><p>Also, I had been to Manchester, and it was <em>freezing</em>. So let’s just say that Paris, for a Brazilian, was more tempting. </p><p>But I wasn’t ready to leave São Paulo. No way, man. You have to understand how much that club means to me. Just talking about it gives me goose bumps. I pretty much grew up at the academy. I made friends there who I consider my brothers. I still stay up late to watch São Paulo play. It’s the club in my heart, the club of my life. I carry it with me everywhere I go. </p><p>But back then, I had never won a trophy for the first team. </p><p>So I told PSG that I would come in winter 2012. I wanted five more months to win a title. Sure, São Paulo would get money for me that they could invest, but how much do the fans care if the training ground is upgraded? What they really want is trophies, right? </p><p>Over the next few months I’d be walking around the training centre and look at these photos of former champions. I was willing to do anything to earn a spot on the wall. Seriously, I really did think<em>, If I have to tear up my contract with PSG to win something here, I will. </em></p><p>When we played the final of the Copa Sudamericana in December that year, I knew it was my last chance. We were playing the second leg in front of 67,000 people at the Morumbi, and before the game I thought about all my memories from São Paulo, all the goals I had scored and all the friends I had made. I thanked God for every moment. </p><p>And, eventually, for the final itself, which was just a blessing. Man ... one goal, one assist and a 2–0 win. It was better than I could have ever imagined.</p><p>I have to say thank you to Rogério Ceni. The guy is the biggest hero in São Paulo history, and that trophy was his<em> </em>to lift. But who did he leave the honour to? Who did he hand the captain’s armband to? </p><p>The kid who was saying goodbye. </p><p>That, to me, is true greatness. </p><h2><strong>THE PEOPLE’S TROPHY</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd6a89s7bkw5hwbsx.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Jasper Juinen/Getty Images"><figcaption>Jasper Juinen/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>What I remember best about the 2013 Confederations Cup is the political situation back home. It was a year before the World Cup and there were a lot of protests in the streets. Oh, and I also remember the way we sang the national anthem. The <em>entire </em>stadium, man! Even when the track stopped, people began singing the second part. The ref couldn’t even move things on, because how was he going to silence the entire Maracanã?</p><p>To beat Spain 3–0 in the final at that<em> </em>stadium was unforgettable. That title belongs to all the Brazilians who came to the games. </p><p>When you hear your people sing the anthem like that, how can you <em>not </em>win?</p><h2><strong>LEARNING FROM BECKHAM</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2640,h_1760,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd6f0r0mspqnebyzr.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="John Berry/Getty Images"><figcaption>John Berry/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Becks! Man, what a top guy. This picture is from his farewell game, which was really emotional. I’m so happy to tell my kids that I played with David Beckham. </p><p>I was shocked when I first met him and Ibra. These guys are superstars, and you kind of expect them to behave like that, you know? You think that perhaps they are a bit arrogant, and maybe they act as if they own the place. They <em>could</em>, because they’re so good. But then you realise that they’re just very hardworking and humble people. </p><p>Beckham was so shy. He barely said anything. He would arrive quietly, settle down and just <em>work</em>. No fuss. That made a big impression on me, especially since I was so young, because it taught me how to behave. </p><p>When even David <em>Beckham </em>stays humble like that, why shouldn’t you?</p><p>We became good friends. He’d joke with me about how much I slept on the team bus. I’d joke with him about how much he ate. He loved French bread, and rightly so. I still don’t know how he stays so slim. </p><h2><strong>THE ANGEL AND THE DEVIL</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2136,h_1424,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd6mpt2gxe2p6spaz.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images"><figcaption>Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>My life changed completely in Paris, and I’m not talking about football. </p><p>Going there at 20 was a shock. The culture, the climate, the tactics, everything was different. I felt this huge pressure to deliver. Then injuries came and I started to miss Brazil. I began thinking, <em>Was I even right to come here? </em></p><p>But then I was introduced to pastor Rafael. We began to talk about God. </p><p>I had had lots of chances to get closer to God in Brazil, but I had never really bothered. What changed in Paris was that people introduced me to Him in a new way. I began to study the Bible, and Rafael invited me to meetings at his home. Alex did, too. I learned so many things, and soon I changed my mind. I was converted. </p><p>Then I met a very special girl, Larissa, and in 2016 we got married. Rafael was the pastor. </p><p>My life has taken on much more meaning since then. It’s funny, because when I came to Paris it looked<em> </em>like I had everything — big club, money, fame — but I had this huge emptiness inside me and I missed my country badly. I think a lot of people feel like, <em>Hey, I’ve got everything, so why am I not happy? </em>The truth is, only God can fill that void. </p><p>I remember hearing the sermon about the man who builds his house on rock and the man who builds his house on sand. As soon as I understood that story, I let God’s voice guide my decisions. It’s like the cartoon with the angel on one side and the devil on the other. Both are trying to make you listen. If you’re close to God, you’re going to listen to the angel. </p><p>This is why Paris is still such a special city to me. I won a lot of things there, but getting to know God was worth more than all my titles combined. </p><h2><em><strong>ADIEU</strong></em><strong>, PARIS</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3890,h_2593,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd6sm0qrgnhg1mt0x.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Jean Catuffe/Getty Images"><figcaption>Jean Catuffe/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The last six months at PSG were the most difficult part of my career, no doubt. The previous season I had scored 19 goals, and then Neymar and Mbappé arrived. I thought I could play next to them, but I wasn’t even in the squad for matches. So I told God, “I’ll fight for six months. If nothing changes, I’ll leave.”</p><p>Luckily my first son, Miguel, was born in November that year. When you come home and lift your son up in your arms, it suddenly seems trivial how many games you’ve started on the bench. </p><p>When Spurs got in touch in January, I went to visit their training centre. London is another great city, and the Premier League is the best in the world. Once God opened that door for me, I didn’t think twice. </p><h2><strong>JUST KICK IT</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd6yem9z87zc15svg.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Dan Mullan/Getty Images"><figcaption>Dan Mullan/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>For the quarterfinals draw in 2019, Julio Cesar was the one picking the balls out of the jar. When he chose Manchester City to play us, I texted him like, “Come on, man. Why did you have to do that?” </p><p>He was like, “Don’t worry, you’ll go through.”</p><p>Once we survived the City tie, I was convinced we’d make the final. But Ajax were the sensations of the tournament, and we lost 1–0 at home. After the game I went over to our fans and shouted, “Come on, believe! Believe!!” </p><p>Then we travel to Amsterdam and go 2–0 down at half-time … hahahaha! </p><p>Man … 3–0 on aggregate. We were done. Toast. But I don’t know why, I just kept believing it was possible. Pochettino told us, “<em>One</em> goal, guys. <em>One</em> goal and we’re back in the match.”</p><p>We were all over them in the second half. Then I somehow scored twice in five minutes. I was thinking, <em>We’ll make it now!! There’s no other way!!!</em></p><p>But the minutes passed and the ball didn’t go in. They hit the post, Hugo made a huge save and the crowd wanted the game to be over. In the final seconds I just thought about staying near the box, because maybe the ball would drop for me. I don’t know how Dele saw me, but suddenly the ball was right in front of me, and man, I swear, I had one single thought. <em>I’m going to kick it</em>. </p><p>That was it!! <em>I’m going to kick it. Doesn’t matter if I hit the grass or the defender’s foot, just kick the thing!! </em></p><p>The ball deflects off a defender and goes in.</p><p>I don’t even know what more to say…. </p><p>For sure, you cannot think clearly in a moment like that. There is this explosion of emotions inside of you that you don’t know how to handle. I didn’t know how to celebrate. When the game was over, I just fell to the floor and cried. I thanked God. I felt this huge sense of gratitude, as if I had received an enormous gift. Everyone came over and hugged me. Inexplicable, man. Seriously, I don’t know how it happened. Ask Him. </p><p>When I got to the dressing room there were bottles flying in the air, water on the floor, teammates jumping around and smashing the table. Then I got on the team bus and called Larissa, who was pregnant with our second child, Pedrinho. She was in tears. I called my family in Brazil, too, and everyone was wearing Spurs shirts, crying and celebrating. </p><p>It was impossible to sleep that night. Impossible. My mind went back to those six months at PSG. Then an angel appeared next to me and said, “See? He had a plan all along.”</p><h2><strong>THE UGLY FINAL</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjd7azgdda75w2eygp.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="TF-Images/Getty Images"><figcaption>TF-Images/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I was told just before we left the hotel. To be benched for the Champions League final was like getting cold water poured down my neck. But I didn’t want to ruin our team spirit, so I stayed quiet. Also, I was sure I’d come on. I had just scored a hat trick, right? </p><p>Finals are hard, man. Often they end up being ugly. Liverpool had a great team, let’s not forget that. So the game was disappointing, but what can you do?</p><p>Football … right? Football. </p><p>When I bump into fans in the streets, they talk about the Ajax game, and then it’s always, “You should have started the final.” But at least I got to the final. Many players don’t even get to <em>play </em>in the Champions League. So I choose to be grateful. I still have my medal. </p><h2><strong>LUCKY ME</strong></h2><p>When I think about these moments, I realise how lucky I’ve been. Even when I didn’t win, I gave everything, and that has made the defeats much easier to accept. If I can get to the end of my career knowing that I did everything I could, I’ll be happy. </p><p>What’s next? My goal is to get back into the national team, because I’d love to play in the World Cup. Also, I really want to win a trophy with Spurs. </p><p>That will be the next moment, I hope.  </p><p>But I realised long ago that these moments do not depend only on me. I’ll make sure to do my part, which is to pray, work hard and play as well as I can. </p><p>The rest, I believe, will be up to Him. </p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CT0B_2BsbS0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fjexqhqhk14q3zyvyf.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>Premier League</category></item><item><title>Dear Mariners Fans</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/mitch-haniger-seattle-mariners-mlb-baseball?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Mitch Haniger</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fhxpjqr51h</guid><description>Mitch Haniger has a message for Seattle Mariners fans: “We’re going to end this f*cking drought.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:49:02 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxrheb5hm8r62txcn.jpg" caption="Rob Tringali/MLB Photos via Getty Images"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Mitch Haniger"></flatplan:author><keywords>MLB,Mariners,mitch haniger,seattle,Seattle Mariners,BASEBALL</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m torn about what to write here.</p><p>On one hand, look, I won’t sugarcoat it. We didn’t get the job done. The goal every year is to end on a W — it’s to win a World Series. And to win the World Series, you need to make the playoffs. We didn’t make it. It’s that simple. Our season ended on an L…. and I’d be insulting all of you guys reading this if I tried to spin it off as anything else. You deserve better than that, and you deserve an honest assessment of things. And I’m at the point in my career where I don’t really feel like being anything other than honest. I respect you guys too much not to speak my mind. And what’s on my mind right now is mostly just: <em>We lost.</em> And that sucks.</p><p>But on the other hand, the reality is, it’s also not that simple. Because while it’s disappointing as hell to have lost that last game, and to have fallen just short of the playoffs…. one loss doesn’t tell the whole story of how I’m going to look back on this season. It couldn’t possibly.</p><p>This season has meant so much to me — in so many different ways.</p><p>Some of you probably know a little bit about how I got here, but for those of you who don’t: It’s been anything but easy, man. It’s been a grind. And I’d say the one lesson I’ve learned from that grind, more than any other, is that progress in baseball…. it doesn’t always happen in a straight line. Success in this game is usually a road full of twists and turns.</p><p>I remember back in 2015, I was in the Diamondbacks system playing Double-A in Mobile — and I just felt like my career was totally stalling out. I wasn’t getting the kind of playing time that I wanted. And I remember thinking to myself, like,<em> It’s now or never. I don’t even care WHERE I play….. I just need to PLAY.</em> So I did something that a lot of people probably would consider career suicide: I asked to be sent down. My agent and I talked with the team, and told them that I’d rather be getting regular at bats in A-ball than riding the bench and catching bullpens in Double-A.</p><p>They agreed, and sent me down to Visalia. Now the pressure was on me to prove myself. I started getting more reps…. and then I started hitting. And then I <em>kept</em> hitting. I kept hitting all the way to a big league call-up by the end of that next season.</p><p>And I think ever since then, really, I’ve just tried to believe in this idea of: Sometimes it can take one step back to take two steps forward. Whether it was after I got traded by the D-Backs, or while I was making changes to my swing, or when I took a 94-mph fastball to the face and had to miss time as a rookie, or whatever else has gotten thrown at me — I’ve just always tried to take that perspective to heart.</p><p>Unfortunately, in 2019, that perspective got seriously tested.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1918,h_1278,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxspt4g5d2507de6z.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Steph Chambers/Getty Images"><figcaption>Steph Chambers/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I was coming off my 2018 season, which was a big year — the kind of year that you dream about having. Played my first full season in the bigs, put up some numbers I was really proud of, made the All-Star team, even got MVP votes. I felt like I was establishing myself as part of our core on the Mariners — and I could not have been more pumped to build on everything in the season to come.</p><p>But then in June of 2019….. well…..</p><p>June of 2019, that was the beginning of a sh*t show.</p><p>June 6th, we’re playing the Astros at our place. I’m up to bat, routine pitch, and I foul it off my thigh. Not just my thigh, though. The ball also ends up clipping my testicle. Somehow I play three more innings through the pain — I just keep telling myself it’s going to be fine, focus on the game, <em>nothing is wrong</em>. Turns out.…. something is extremely wrong. “Ruptured testicle,” not words you ever want to hear. I have to have emergency surgery that night, then a follow-up surgery because of complications from the first one.</p><p>And from there, it’s just one setback after another. First it’s sharp groin pain on the second day I’m back running. Then it’s a bulging disk in my spine, caused by the groin injury, that ends my first rehab assignment. Then I get a second opinion on my back, and I’m told my entire season is over because a compromised groin will only further injure my bulging disk. Then, in January of 2020, after months of rehab and as I’m finally ramping up for the new season, I&#39;m struck with unbearable pain. I go to a core specialist in Philly, get an MRI, and it turns out for the last six months I’ve had what’s called a “torn adductor attachment” in the bottom of my core/groin area. Devastating. So I have surgery in Philly. Then I start rehabbing that surgery…. only I’m having trouble doing any of the basic rehab stuff because my back is killing me, actually more than before. I get another MRI. They tell me that my herniated disk has gotten a lot worse over the last couple months, and I’m going to need back surgery as well. So now I’m looking at my <em>2020</em> season being over before it’s even gotten started — on top of the 2019 season I’ve already missed.</p><p>This one random injury just turned into a whole landslide of injuries.</p><p>And I won’t lie: those two seasons, all that time away, it was brutal. It was incredibly frustrating, and at times overwhelming. I kept thinking about how hard I’d worked to get to where I was as a baseball player — and then how it had been snatched away from me in a blink. One swing. One stupid foul ball. It was scary, too. You go through a series of injuries and surgeries and rehabs like that, and it’s hard not to let certain thoughts creep in. I remember these nights where I would just wake up in pain, feeling so defeated, and ask my wife, Amanda, “Is this ever going to end?? Am I ever going to get back to normal??” There were definitely moments of real doubt, as far as whether I’d be able to make it back, let alone make it back to the level I was at before all of this started. And for a baseball player, man, I’ll tell you what…. that’s a pretty low feeling.</p><p>In the end, I’d say there were three main things that helped me make it through.</p><p>One: family. ​Amanda, who’s my absolute rock. Our daughter, Karly, who’s having her first birthday in December. My parents…. my grandma…. and really everyone else in our family who’s been there for me, and been in my corner. I’m incredibly lucky.</p><p>Two: a genuine support system, even outside of my family. My agent, my physical therapists, my friends….. so many people have helped me out in such a big way over these last few years.</p><p>And last but of course not least: the Mariners community. From John Stanton at the top….. to everyone on the team who held down the fort while I was out injured…. to our fans…. truly, to all of you guys. Any time I had doubts, I would visualize myself back on the field, playing the game I love alongside my teammates, in front of you all.</p><p>And I’d think about the unfinished business that we have as a ballclub.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3611,h_2407,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxv1py0yxh6zprvpm.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Ted S. Warren/AP Photo"><figcaption>Ted S. Warren/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>But I told you I’m going to be honest here….. and I’m not going to pretend I saw a 90-win team walking around our locker room from Day One. </p><p>I don’t think any of us did.</p><p>I mean, we all saw the preseason coverage. ESPN had us winning 70 games, and I’m pretty sure some places didn’t even have us winning that many. No one out there was giving us much of a chance. And I definitely felt like those predictions were missing parts of our story, and missing a bunch of the little things that were starting to come together to add up to something bigger — no question. I definitely felt like we were better than we were getting credit for. But <em>even still</em>, man. Ha. Like….. when I say I thought that we might surprise some people? I mean I thought that we could put it together and play .500 ball. I mean I thought that we could hang around.</p><p>We did a little more than hang around. Heading into the All-Star break, we were a full five games over .500. Still flying pretty far under the radar — but I think we knew to expect that. From a national perspective, I think it’s just always going to be that way, playing on the West Coast. And from a local perspective, you know…. who can blame anyone?? There’s no point in beating around the bush: We have the longest playoff drought in all of North American major league sports. Mariners fans have been through a lot of heartbreak over the years. We knew we weren’t entitled to their support, just based on a half season of good baseball. We knew we had to earn it.</p><p>I think the first time this season that I really let myself think out loud, you know, <em>O.K., we’ve got something going here</em>, it was around the middle of July. One thing you have to remember is — with Kyle coming up on free agency, and with the team not expected to contend, there’d been a lot of talk early on in the season that he could be getting moved at the deadline. And I’m a year away from my own free agency, but there’d definitely been talk that I could get moved as well. It wasn’t really something we’d ever bring up in conversation — you’re trying hard to stay in the moment as much as possible. It was “in the air,” though, you know what I’m saying?</p><p>But we just kept on winning. And then from there — I mean, it was so funny, man. One day Kyle and I are talking, and I just remember kind of blurting this out to him, like: “Dude….. there’s <em>no way</em> we get traded. Not anymore. We’ve gotta be <em>adding </em>pieces now. We could legit make the playoffs.”</p><p>And once the deadline passed, and Kyle was still here, that just kind of became this rallying cry. <em>Playoffs, Cap!! This is the year,</em> guys would tell Seager, and I really think that says a lot — both about Kyle and about this team. It tells you what an amazing and respected leader Seager is, for everyone to rally around him like that, and to want to send him to the playoffs. But it also tells you what kind of a team this is. Because it’s not like any of our young guys have been here for all 11 of Kyle’s seasons with the club, right? It’s not like that’s their history. But they still <em>owned</em> that history — and owned the mission to change it.</p><p>It’s the same thing with the drought. Like…. obviously no one on this team has been here since 2001. It’s not “our” drought, really. But it <em>is</em> our drought. We know that. We know it’s part of the deal. And I’m proud of the way that we’ve carried that weight.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3235,h_2156,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxtfg6fza2trwvx6a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Steph Chambers/Getty Images"><figcaption>Steph Chambers/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And then at some point in there….. this season just got really, really fun.</p><p>It was kind of like — once we acknowledged out loud what we were playing for, and what we were capable of?? We just gained more and more confidence, and more and more purpose. Vets like Kyle, like Murph, like J.P., like Marco, they set the tone. Younger guys like Jarred, like Ty, like Jake, like Logan, they bought in. There was a level of accountability that we held ourselves to, all season, that I think was pretty special. And I don’t know, man….. we just got better and better. You know that scene in every sports movie where the players look at each other during the “winning streak” montage, and they’re like, <em>Wait. What the heck is going ON here? We can’t lose!!</em> It felt like that — but in real life.</p><p>And I hope this goes without saying.... but the run we went on flat-out <em>does not happen</em> without the energy that we got — night in and night out — from our fans. None of this happens without you guys, and the way that you showed up when we needed you most.</p><p>I remember after we lost in Kansas City a few weeks ago, just looking over at the standings, and then looking at our schedule….. and thinking to myself, <em>Alright — we have like no margin left. We pretty much have to take care of business the rest of the way.</em> And I swear it was like, in that moment, we all just got on this crazy wavelength together. Not only the team, but the fans as well. It was like we all understood the task at hand: win out, or come close….. and make some magic.</p><p>There were 14 games left at that point.</p><p>We went 11–3.</p><p>I’ll never forget that run.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3296,h_2197,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxtm18btqvmemxcf8.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Steph Chambers/Getty Images"><figcaption>Steph Chambers/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But like I said at the top….. I’m torn about what to write here. I don’t want anyone thinking for a single minute that we feel even a little bit satisfied by how our season ended. We’re crushed, man. We’re pissed off. It <em>kills me</em> that we’re not out there, right now, in the playoffs, competing for a championship.</p><p>We lost when it mattered most. We fell short of our goal — period.</p><p>And I need every Mariners fan to know that.</p><p>But I also need them to know something else: <em>This group is going to the playoffs.</em> That’s not an if….. it’s a when. And that when is soon.</p><p>We’re going to end this f*cking drought.</p><p>And then we’re not stopping there. Because, yeah: This hurts. Yeah, it sucks to be taking this step back. It sucks to go from having 40,000-plus rocking T-Mobile Park, to go from having this city fired up beyond belief, to now being stuck at home watching these games from the couch. I HATE it. But that’s how you overcome adversity, and that’s how you persevere — in baseball, or in whatever else. You fail…. you take your step back….. then you regroup. You figure it out. And you take TWO steps forward.</p><p>And that’s what’s going to happen here in Seattle.</p><p>I hope the other teams in the league are all reading this, and they understand that we’re about to <em>get after it</em> in the offseason. And then we’re coming for one of those playoff spots — and more. </p><p>I hope our front office is reading this, and they understand that it’s time to really go all-in. It’s time to make some impact moves, and put this group over the top. </p><p>And I hope our fans are all reading this. I hope you guys understand that it may be the end of the season….. but it isn’t an ending. This is a damn start.</p><p>Thanks for sticking with us, and for the most fun I’ve ever had on a baseball field.</p><p>I hope y’all are excited about the Mariners again.</p><p>I’ll see you in the spring.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxv5zjy3bxjk4a5rd.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>MLB</category></item><item><title>Don’t Count Us Out</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/michaela-onyenwere-new-york-liberty-basketball-wnba?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Michaela Onyenwere</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fhxahdz8rx</guid><description>Keep your eyes on Michaela Onyenwere and the New York Liberty: “We’re building something special here ... so get used to seeing us.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 19:05:25 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3000,h_1687,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxanftsnndyt8gsea.jpg" caption="Steven Freeman/NBAE via Getty Images"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Michaela Onyenwere"></flatplan:author><keywords>WNBA,UCLA,basketball,michaela onyenwere</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You don’t realize how <em>legendary</em> Barclays Center is until you walk the halls of it. In the heart of downtown, where we get to play, some of the greatest musicians have performed. I’m talking about ...</p><p><em>Beyoncé. JAY Z. Rihanna. </em></p><p>I’m talking about anybody who’s anybody has been in Barclays. </p><p>Just walking from the locker room onto the floor and seeing all the legends surrounding the walls of the arena, it gets you ready. It reminds you that you have a level of greatness to achieve. </p><p>New York is special. I’m from Colorado so that’s always going to be home, and I obviously got love for L.A. too.... But I can’t lie — Brooklyn is the coolest city. The <em>best</em> fans, not to mention the <em>best </em>arena in the world.</p><p>I still remember my first game in the W on that court — it was against Indiana. </p><p>I was NERVOUS. I literally had to go do yoga to calm myself down before the game because I was just so ready to go out there. My name gets called in the starting lineup, and at this point I’m just ready to get the game going. </p><p>There really aren’t any dos or don’ts anyone warned me about coming in as a rookie, but I did something that still to this day I’m trying to figure out <em>why</em>. </p><blockquote>Brooklyn is the coolest city.

Tip-off goes and I get the ball.</p><p>And what do I do? I shoot this longggg three-pointer…. I had to be at least two feet away from the three-point line!! Lol.</p><p>I mean, you gotta picture it. First shot ever in the W, and I’m sitting there — ball in mid air — like, <em>Michaela, what are you doing, girl?</em></p><p><em>SPLASH. </em> </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3155,h_2103,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxf0a6t6wxx2spzey.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Catalina Fragoso/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Catalina Fragoso/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>To my surprise, the shot went in, and I’m just running down the court like “O.K.!! We’re <em>here</em>. Let’s do this.” </p><p>That really sums up how I’ve always approached the game. I try not to think too much about it and just play. I try to control the things that I can control, which is how hard I play every night on the floor. </p><p>I’ve never been one to really play into the hype about things. Even in high school when I started getting recruited, I HATED the recruitment process. </p><p>Not because I didn’t want to play or because I didn’t like hearing from coaches, but because <em>all I wanted to do was play ball</em>. </p><p>That’s it. </p><p>When you’re getting recruited it’s constant nonstop phone calls, text messages. But I was just focused on hoopin’. </p><p>So, I made my list of schools: Duke, Arizona State, Tennessee…. And, of course, <em>UCLA.</em> </p><p>Let me tell y’all right now…. Once I stepped on that UCLA campus, it was like a perfect fit. The vision the coaches saw for me and the team was enough for me to know that I was meant to be a Bruin. </p><p>There’s something special about that Bruin Blue. </p><p>Wearing that jersey brought a lot of really great moments, especially competing in the Pac-12, but I think one of my <em>favorite</em> moments was my final year when we faced off against Oregon, and I had a career-high. We ALWAYS wanted to beat Oregon. And I mean ALWAYS (just ask <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/sabrina_ionescu" target="_blank">Sabrina</a> lol).  </p><p>Anyway, the season ends, and it’s time to decide if I’m going to stay another year or leave. </p><p>It was crazy because before I could even decide what I was going to do I started to hear all this chatter. Nothing but doubts from skeptics. I heard it all. </p><p>But I was O.K. with being an underdog. <em>Honestly it’s better that way</em>. </p><p>I opted out and now I’m hearing everyone talk about where I could go in the draft. I’m trying to block it out, but then while I’m scrolling on social media, it’s just inevitable — I’m seeing mock drafts pop up and everything. I tried to put everyone on a media blackout — even my coach. I just did NOT want to hear it. It was an overwhelming process and I honestly wanted no parts of it at the time.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxfspgz5jk5jct5we.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Carmen Mandato/Getty Images"><figcaption>Carmen Mandato/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So draft day comes along, and I wake up soooo <em>nervous</em>. </p><p>Not just regular nervous but that type of nervous where you’re just so excited you want to cry … yup, that was me. </p><p>I’m in Colorado with my entire family at my draft party, we got the whole spread. Balloons, food, and tons of people. I’m sitting there in the living room with my makeup and hair done, just waiting for the draft to start. Still nervous. All the TV monitors and cameras are set up waiting for my reaction when they call my name. </p><p>Everyone keeps asking me, “Where do you think you’re going?” I’m just like “IDK!!” Lol.</p><p>The first few picks go, and then I started to hear from my agent, Allison, that I could go anywhere from pick 5 to 12 … which didn’t help how anxious I already was. </p><p>New York rolls around with pick 6 and they’re on the clock, and I get this text from Allison saying, “This will probably be it.”</p><p>I’m just sitting there waiting, still prepared if they don’t call my name.</p><p>Then I heard them say “<em>Michaela Onyenwere</em>,<em>”</em> and I went CRAZY! My whole family went crazy! We were so happy to know I would be joining the <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/collections/we-are-new-york-liberty" target="_blank">Liberty</a>. </p><p>But, there was one person on earth who was even happier than me ...</p><p>MY GRANDMA LOL</p><p>I <em>know</em> y’all didn’t forget. Yes, that was my grandma going crazy in the background when Holly Rowe was interviewing me. She asked to see my mom’s jacket, and before I knew it my grandma got up and started doing her dance, saying “I’m the grandma.” Hahaha. The thing people don’t understand is that my grandma is Nigerian, so this wasn’t something for the cameras. That’s just her 24/7 365. </p><p>What they captured on TV that day is her all the time: The star of the show.</p><p>She’s the cutest ever. I love her so much because in a matter of hours she was going viral. I came back to my phone after some meetings and interviews and everyone was blowing my phone up.</p><p><em>“Hey, is this your grandma on TMZ?” </em></p><p><em>“The Shade Room just posted your grandma.” </em></p><p>It couldn’t have been a better way for draft night to end. I get to play in New York and my grandma becomes known all around the world just for being herself hahaha. </p><p>And no one let me forget it either, not even fans in New York. </p><p>I got off the plane and people were asking me “Hey, aren’t you that girl who was on TV with their grandma going crazy in the background?”</p><p>Yup, that’s her. </p><p>Really, how my grandma acted was how I felt just about being in New York with this team. </p><p>I was <em>excited</em>. </p><p>But I had no time to keep celebrating because I had just got to New York less than 48 hours after hearing my name get called and I had a couple days of quarantine.</p><blockquote>How my grandma acted was how I felt just about being in New York with this team. <cite>Michaela Onyenwere</cite></blockquote><p>Then the work started, right into individual workouts and getting ready for training camp, which was right around the corner. That eagerness I had translated right into the season. </p><p>Throughout the entire season you could tell how excited we were to play with each other and just grow as the season progressed. We know we’re one of the younger teams in the league, but we always <em>competed</em>. It showed even after we had that losing streak at the end of the season and were waiting to see if we would get into the playoffs. We just needed an opportunity. We didn’t care who it was against. </p><p>Once we saw we had Phoenix, we all just told each other, “Let’s <em>go.</em>” </p><p>We knew we had nothing to lose and everything to gain from just competing like we always do.</p><p>I love this team because we have this never quit mentality. You give us a chance, O.K., we’ll prove to you why you don’t want to count us out. We’re still growing, but we play our <em>hearts</em> out every game. </p><p>Making the playoffs for the first time since 2017 was big. Me and Didi looked at each other in the locker room and asked everyone, “What’s the one thing that was missing since 2017?”</p><p>Everyone just looked around the room and we’re like … US! Lol the vets were just like, “shut up” haha but that’s how our team is. So much personality and life. </p><blockquote>You give us a chance, O.K., we’ll prove to you why you don’t want to count us out.<cite>Michaela Onyenwere</cite></blockquote><p>Leading up to that last practice before we played Phoenix there was some talk that I could win Rookie of the Year. Again, I try not to pay attention to that stuff. To be real, I didn’t even really know they were about to announce it. One of the only awards I have ever really patted myself on the back for was becoming a McDonald’s All-American. (And by the way, guess who my roommate was for the All-American game. <em>Didi Richards. </em>How ironic, right?) </p><p>But, we’re all standing in practice, I&#39;m in the middle of the logo and the PR team comes to tell us announcements and stuff like usual. </p><p>Then, I hear ...“Michaela Onyenwere Rookie of the Year.” </p><p>It caught me by surprise. I was NOT expecting that. </p><p>I’m just standing there, <em>shocked</em>, and everyone starts screaming. </p><p>I told you this team has PERSONALITY. So the only correct way to celebrate was me dancing in the center of the court while all my teammates were saying, “Go Mic! Go Mic!” (I’m sure you guys saw the video lol) </p><p>It’s the most humbling thing to be named Rookie of the Year, but I mean …  the <em>FIRST</em> in New York Liberty franchise history? I don’t take this accomplishment lightly. Especially when I was having to guard some of the toughest players in the league night in and night out. </p><p><a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/aja-wilson" target="_blank"><em>A’ja Wilson</em></a><em>. </em><a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/candace-parker" target="_blank"><em>Candace Parker.</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/contributors/jonquel-jones" target="_blank"><em>Jonquel Jones. </em></a></p><p>I’m talking about having to defend SUPERSTARS. </p><p>So to get this award was another pat on the back moment for me because I know the work I put into this game. I heard how people counted me out and didn’t think that I would be able to contribute to this team in my first year. That’s why I love New York and this organization so much for drafting me and believing in me from Day One. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxf8d5qmmtqnt6qhw.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Ned Dishman/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>It’s still a surreal moment for me. Bringing this award to New York means everything to me.</p><p>But, before I could really celebrate the award, we had a tough single-elimination game against Phoenix. </p><p>Y’all know how it went. Down by three with a few seconds left. Betnijah comes down, hits the three and we’re tied. All we need to do is get <em>one</em> stop. It was a roller coaster of a game. </p><p>83–82. </p><p>Losing in the final seconds like that was heartbreaking.</p><p>It hurts. No one likes losing, especially not me. I hate it. People <em>say</em> they hate losing but I really HATE losing. </p><p>But, that loss was something that we knew we were going to take with us into next season. Even though we lost, we walked into that locker room hurt but proud of ourselves. </p><p>Our season was rocky. We were learning every game and it seemed like all we heard was doubt after doubt. We were told continuously that we weren’t going to make the playoffs but we did. </p><p><em>Then we heard, “There’s no way this young team can compete with a team like Phoenix.” </em></p><p>Again, we proved everyone wrong. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxg54nw6be23bknwh.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Sarah Stier/Getty Images"><figcaption>Sarah Stier/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><em>The W also proved everyone wrong, too.</em> You see our games and see the energy we bring every night on that court. Those are hard-fought, exciting games to watch, and we love that more people are taking notice. Yeah, we hear the lil chatter from trolls online about how it’s not fun to watch us or that ratings are low. </p><p>But if these playoffs proved one thing, it’s this: If you’re <em>bored</em> when the W is on?? Then you’re <em>just not </em>watching. </p><p>Because the W puts on a SHOW, and all we want is the opportunity to share that with our fans. </p><p>And if you think this season was entertaining, just wait for next season. The W is still evolving and the world needs to pay attention. </p><p>That playoff game and the entire season taught not only us but everybody else that the New York Liberty are here to <em>stay</em> and … that we’re even <em>hungrier</em>. </p><p>To the city of New York that continues to embrace us and believe in us, showing up and showing out in  their Liberty seafoam jerseys at games, THANK YOU for making us feel important. </p><p>We’re building something <em>special </em>here and we’re only going to keep getting better, so get used to seeing us. The sky isn’t the limit for this team because we know how high we can go and I say with all the confidence in the world that this team will be back next year!  </p><p>I promise you. </p><p>Even my grandma knows how we coming next season. I’ll be honest, because a lot of people have been asking me about her. She isn’t the biggest basketball fan in the world, but she’s most definitely a Liberty fan. And after every game, I always get a text from her, and it says a lot of different things depending on if we played good or bad. </p><p>But every single time, she ends it with the most important thing. She says, “I’m proud of you.”</p><p>So keep your eyes on us because we’re just getting started. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhxf943wdp3kdtqns7.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>WNBA</category></item><item><title>Clear the Whiteboard</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/jesse-lingard-premier-league-soccer-england-manchester-united?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Jesse Lingard</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fhr1c3tzsz</guid><description>Jesse Lingard on his loan to West Ham, his Manchester United career and playing for England.</description><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 11:00:29 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4000,h_2250,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhtpeq4c5wcwhymcjp.jpg" caption="Michael Regan/The FA via Getty Images"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Jesse Lingard"></flatplan:author><keywords>Premier League,West Ham United,Manchester United,Jessica Andrade,Soccer,England</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is a story about me, but really it’s about my brother Lou. </p><p>Without him, I wouldn’t be where I am today. No chance. </p><p>Well, not without him <em>and</em> his two whiteboards, but I’ll get to that.</p><p>First, let’s talk about the setbacks. </p><p>About two months ago, I was buzzing. The fans were back at Old Trafford. I was feeling sharp in preseason. Ole was happy with me. I couldn’t wait for the Prem to start.</p><p>Then a week before our first game, I tested positive for COVID-19. </p><p>Ten days in isolation. Gutted. </p><p>But believe it or not, that wasn&#39;t even the worst thing that happened to me last summer. Back in June, I really thought I had done enough to get into the final 26 for the Euros. Obviously, I respected <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/dear-england-gareth-southgate-euros-soccer" target="_blank">Gareth’s</a> decision, but when I rang to tell my brother, well ... I cried. Lou cried as well. </p><p>Two years ago, that news would have crushed me completely. </p><blockquote>When I rang to tell my brother, well ... I cried. Lou cried as well. <cite>Jesse Lingard</cite></blockquote><p>Thankfully, I’m in a better place these days. When the boys played the opener, I wasn’t going to sit around and mope. I might not have been playing, but I was still a <em>fan</em>, right?? So I pulled on a shirt — I’m close to Dec, so it had to be RICE 4 on the back — and I went to a pub with Lou and some friends. This guy there was walking around with a parrot — how random is that? — and suddenly it’s sitting right on my shoulder watching us beat Croatia!! </p><p>You gotta love the pub when England are playing — the atmosphere, the energy. I took some pics, signed some autographs. I’m not really sure how it happened, but soon I was on the DJ decks! </p><p>What an afternoon that was.  </p><p>I’ll say this to every player: Join the fans in a pub at least <em>once</em> during your career. It just gives you a different perspective. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhtpwthzctvmjj8s1w.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Jesse Lingard"><figcaption>Courtesy of Jesse Lingard</figcaption></figure><p>Let me be clear, though: While watching the boys is always great fun, playing for England is <em>massive</em> for me. Every time I pull on that shirt I feel blessed.</p><p>To be able to ring my family and tell them that I had gotten the call-up again for the internationals in September was a <em>huge</em> feeling. And then to do it again for the latest squad to face Andorra and Hungary … I can’t even describe it, except to say: It feels good to be back!</p><p>Being a part of <em>this</em> team in particular for the Euros would have been really special, given everything it went on to achieve and the way it brought people together and changed perspectives. <em>Of course</em> I would have wanted to be one of the final 26.</p><p>But I chose to look at the big picture. In November 2020, I had been <em>nowhere near</em> the squad. I wasn’t even thinking about it. So when I got the call-up in March, that was huge for me. Honestly, just to be in the <em>mix</em> was a bonus. </p><p>You gotta remember where I was coming from. </p><p>You gotta understand how low I’d really sunk. </p><p>Making it to the semifinals of the 2018 World Cup was one of the best experiences of my career. You remember that song? </p><p>“Whoa, England are in Russia … Whoa, drinking all your vodka … Whoa, England’s going all the way!”</p><p>So jokes.</p><p>But then, right after I came back for the 2018–19 season, I got this injury in my groin. <em>Osteitis pubis</em>. Proper niggly one.</p><p>I’ve always run a lot in games, like 12, 13 kilometres. That takes a toll, but I’d always been able to push myself. This time it was different. I couldn’t keep going. After a few matches, I just stopped. Couldn’t play, couldn’t train. My body had just had enough. Everything came grinding to a halt — right when I was on that high. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1918,h_1278,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhtqvf341808v9n9s6.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images"><figcaption>Matthew Peters/Manchester United via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>José Mourinho was the Manchester United manager back then and … well, he didn’t really like his players being injured. He didn’t want to know about it.</p><p>And I’m like, “It’s not my fault, is it, Boss?!”</p><p>Me and José had a good relationship generally, though, I have to say. He was good to me. Before all the injury stuff, he trusted me, put me in for important games. We won trophies and he made me a <em>winner</em>. He could just bring out that side in you. </p><p>He also liked to have a personal connection with his players. Sometimes I’d look at my phone and I’d be getting a random FaceTime from him. Just out of nowhere — just to check in.</p><p>I used to find it <em>so</em> strange at first.</p><p>He’d call and be like, “Hey Jesse, what are you doing?”</p><p>And I’d be like, “Erm, just chilling, watching TV … (<em>awkward silence</em>) … what are <em>you</em> doing?”</p><p>Hahaha!</p><p>I found it funny. And, to be fair, it showed how much he cared about us.</p><p>But in terms of injuries, yeah, it was tough, because he didn’t want to hear it.</p><blockquote>We won trophies and he made me a winner. He could just bring out that side in you. <cite>Jesse Lingard</cite></blockquote><p>From that point, I couldn’t get back to where I had been. I was struggling mentally as well as physically. There was the off-field stuff with my mum and her battle with depression. I’ve talked about it before, and that isn’t what this story is about — but that affected me, too. It’s my <em>mum</em>, you know?</p><p>Not playing only made things worse. But when I finally did play, even when I was fit again … I wasn’t me. My family kept coming to games, but they couldn’t even watch me. They were like, ‘This ain’t you. This ain’t your aura.” Games were passing me by like I wasn&#39;t there. Like a ghost.</p><p>I even remember Bruno Fernandes coming to me before a game and saying, “Today I want to see the Jesse Lingard that I know.”</p><p>All I could think was, “Mate, I can’t, ’cause this is not me!” </p><p>I love football. Love it to death. But there were times when I thought, “I just can’t do this anymore.” </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2800,h_1575,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhtzkd0cy661nyz4ck.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="David Ramos/FIFA via Getty Images"><figcaption>David Ramos/FIFA via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In my personal life, I buried myself in my phone. Face glued to screens. You might get a <em>mm-hmm</em> out of me in a conversation, but I wasn’t <em>really</em> listening. I was bottling it all up. All these emotions and all this stress.</p><p>I became a target for the media. I was getting picked on.</p><p>It went like that all season and well into the next. In a year and a half, I went from top of the world to as low as I’d ever been.</p><p>So much so that when lockdown came … it’s weird to say, but despite everything, it was a <em>good</em> thing for me, personally. I had pretty much written myself off. </p><p>Suddenly I got a chance to hit that reset button.</p><p>This is the part where my brother Lou comes in.</p><p>We’ve always been tight and he’s always looked out for me, like an older brother does, you know? He saw my potential at a very young age and he’s always given me advice and pushed me. But in that period of my life, he really stepped up. </p><p>Lou <em>never</em> wrote me off. </p><p>During lockdown, whenever he knew I was feeling low, he would send me these clips of myself. Me scoring goals, me playing at the World Cup, me winning trophies. And he’d write, “Look what you can do. Believe in yourself. You <em>are</em> a class player.”</p><blockquote>I had pretty much written myself off. <cite>Jesse Lingard</cite></blockquote><p>He was pretty much bombarding me. And soon I had seen so many messages that I started to believe him.</p><p><em>Maybe I am still a good player?</em></p><p>I kept myself fit in lockdown, and he was setting targets for me to hit during workouts. He’d even send me <em>his</em> 5K times, trying to beat mine. </p><p>(Sorry, Bro, but that ain’t happening. Haha!)</p><p>He was the one who told me, “If you go out on loan, you’ll smash it!”</p><p>I finally found the courage to talk to Ole and the guys at United about everything I was going through. It wasn’t an easy thing to do, but Ole’s not just a manager, he’s a friend. I’ve known him for ages. He gave me my debut for the reserves way back. He’d always tell me, “Anything you need, just knock on my door.”</p><p>When I did finally talk to him about everything that was going on, his response was, “I wish you’d come to me sooner.”</p><p>After he said that, I was like, &#34;Why <em>didn&#39;t</em> I say anything before?&#34;</p><p>I thought I could do it all on my own, but I couldn’t. You need people.</p><p>This was halfway through last season. Ole wanted me to stay at United and help the team last January, but for my own sake he understood that I needed to go. I needed to play regular football again. I needed a new environment. </p><p>I just needed a club to take a chance on me.</p><p>Then with Deadline Day approaching, everything went <em>crazy, </em>I’m telling you. We’d only really heard whispers about West Ham’s interest and there wasn’t much time left to complete a deal. First the loan was on ... then off ... then back on again. I was going through a roller coaster of emotions. </p><p>When the deal finally got done, I was buzzing to start fresh. If the medical had been done in time, I would’ve played against Liverpool two days after I signed. I was <em>that</em> ready.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2797,h_1864,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhv05ew01xg0kfcsxh.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Justin Tallis/Pool/Getty Images"><figcaption>Justin Tallis/Pool/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I felt like I just fit in straight away. There’s a great group of lads at West Ham. They made that transition so easy for me.</p><p>When I first arrived, I was like, “Get me in the group chats!!”</p><p>Dec, Freddo, Aaron, Nobes. They were always just coming for each other.</p><p>Freddo — that’s Ryan Fredericks — would just see you come into training and be like, “<em>Pfffft</em>, wow<em> …</em> I can’t <em>believe</em> what you’ve done.”</p><p>And I’d be like, “What? What have I done?!” </p><p>He was just scaring me, right?</p><p>And he’d keep it up <em>all day</em>, until eventually you started breaking down like, “Yo, wait, have I really done something?” And then you realise there’s nothing and he’s just having you on.</p><p>Then there’s Mark Noble. Let me tell you about Nobes. He’s got banter, or at least he <em>thinks</em> he does. He had it in for me from the time the gaffer called me Golden Boy in training.</p><p>We were doing boxes and the ball went out. I touched it last, but David Moyes was like, “No, no, no, Jesse doesn’t have to go in the middle. He’s our <em>Golden Boy</em>!”</p><p>After that Nobes was after me!</p><p>Seriously though, he took me under his wing and explained to me what West Ham is all about. I remember on one of my first away games, I was sitting in the back of his car on the way to the airport. It was just me, him and Aaron Cresswell.</p><p>Immediately, I was on my phone. Just automatic, as you do. But he wasn’t having any of it. He turned to me saying, “Whoa, no phones allowed in here! We <em>talk</em>.”</p><p>I was like, “O.K. … fine.”</p><p>On the plane, I would normally whack the headphones on and listen to music, but Nobes and the rest of the guys wouldn’t stand for it. </p><p>It was like that everywhere at West Ham, proper conversations about <em>everything</em>. No phones, no social media. No more mm-hmm. If we were having dinner at a hotel, we’d stay down there for ages just talking. It helped us bond as a team, and personally, it helped me a lot.</p><blockquote>What you saw at West Ham was the player I can be when everything is coming together.<cite>Jesse Lingard</cite></blockquote><p>There is another part of what changed for me during those months … and that was all down to Lou.</p><p>When we moved down to London, one of the first things he did was set up these two whiteboards in our flat.</p><p>He brought them in and I was like, <em>What is he doing?</em></p><p>He goes, “This one’s for targets, this one’s for motivation. Boom. Boom.”</p><p>On the left, you had goals, assists, distances, shots, take-ons, everything.</p><p>On the right, it was all motivational stuff: key words, quotes, stuff to get me hyped.</p><p>He wrote down some targets for before the international break: four goals, two assists. I told him, “Nah, put like eight goals … <em>nine </em>goals!”</p><p>He was like, “Bro, if you go too high at the start, you might not hit it.”</p><p>So we went with four goals and two assists. </p><p>I hit both. </p><p>Lou was like, “Alright, six goals, four assists.” Hit that too. </p><p>Tick. Tick. </p><p>The quotes worked as well, mate. My motivation was through the roof. Everything I needed was all there on those two boards.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhv15n8vwx247jmj4k.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Clive Brunskill/Getty Images"><figcaption>Clive Brunskill/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>I say everything ... we had to add Premier League Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.</p><p>When I first got nominated for Player of the Month in February, we were like, “What’s this then?! <em>Err</em>, add it to the board!”</p><p>Then it became three nominations in a row, February, March, April! I’d been on the shortlist before in my career, but had never won.</p><p>I felt really close in March, but Kelechi Iheanacho bagged a hat trick and snuck it … probably deserved it, to be fair.</p><p>By April, I had forgotten about it (honestly). Then the media guy at West Ham sent me a voice note, and he&#39;s like, &#34;You&#39;ve won Player … <em>and</em> Goal of the Month.&#34; </p><p>I rang Lou straight away. It didn’t sink in until I told my family and I heard how emotional they were. Then I was like, <em>Wow, this is big.</em></p><p>Back to the whiteboard.</p><p>Tick. Tick.</p><p>After that Bruno Fernandes referred to me as the “best player in the Premier League” in an interview with United … me!! Can you believe that?!?

Hahaha!</p><p>I wasn’t overachieving, though. What you saw at West Ham was the player I <em>can</em> be when everything is coming together. Let’s say it was an upgraded<em> </em>version of the old Jesse Lingard.</p><p>Jesse 2.0. </p><p>When I came back to United, I felt like a different person. I’m more mature, more confident. I’m taking more responsibility. To be fair, I’ve got to credit Moyes and the West Ham lads for that. Cheers for everything, boys. </p><p>I’ve been so excited about this season. It might sound like a funny thing to say when you’ve been at a club all your life, but I have really wanted to show people what I can <em>do</em>, you know what I mean? </p><p>I don’t want to be the player who does well for just a few weeks or months. I want to show how many goals and assists I can get over <em>30-plus </em>games. </p><p>Same goes for England. I’m so honoured to be back in the squad again after the journey I’ve been on. To bag those two goals against Andorra during the last break ... honestly, I was just buzzing! </p><p>But I want more.</p><p>No more quarantine.

And look, I get it. Buses break down. That’s just part of life in the ECHL, or as we called it: the Coast. But this was our <em>third </em>bus to break down in my first four road trips with the team. I had been drafted by the Senators six years earlier, and at that point, sitting on that bus … it hit me.</p><p>I had as many bus breakdowns in the Coast as I did games played in the NHL.</p><p>I wasn’t a rookie anymore. This wasn’t my first rodeo in the Coast. I had been going up and down and up and down and up and down more times than you’d even believe. I was an elite luggage packer.</p><blockquote>There’s something about the league that has always felt so far away from me.<cite>Chris Driedger</cite></blockquote><p>But as far as the NHL goes ... I had been up for a couple of cups of coffee, but I hadn’t been able to make it stick. There’s something about the league that has always felt so far away from me. I grew up in Winnipeg, and we didn’t have the Jets back then, so the NHL was almost foreign, in a way. Even when I had been drafted in the third round in 2012, I never really thought I’d make it. I don’t know if that’s a weird attitude to have for a professional athlete, and it’s not like I didn&#39;t believe in myself. I just … every time I looked at a depth chart, there were four or five goalies ahead of me. And when you’re riding buses in the Coast, dreaming about the NHL is a good way to make the bus move as slowly as possible.</p><p>Being down there, two levels away from the league ... it might seem close if you’re just looking at a glance, but, <em>man</em> — it doesn’t feel like that.</p><p>You know that place Leo DiCaprio goes to at the end of <em>Inception</em>? Like the fourth layer of the dream or whatever? Where you can spend thousands of years?</p><p>That’s the Coast.</p><p>Once you’re down there, <em>anything </em>can happen.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhr83ggvps50144cfv.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Marissa Baecker/Getty Images"><figcaption>Marissa Baecker/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But here’s the thing: Some of my best friends, some of my favorite memories ever — they happened there. I’m thankful to so many of my coaches and teammates that I met on those teams.</p><p>What I didn’t tell you about that bus breaking down was that, after the bus driver told us we weren’t going anywhere, all of us cracked up and we just made a day of it. We eventually got where we were going, I’m sure. And I mean, we still got to play hockey for money, you know? Who cares about a bus?</p><p>These past few months, since I signed in Seattle, I’ve been thinking about the Coast quite a bit. Thinking about everything it’s taken to get here. I feel so fortunate to be a member of the Kraken, and to get to experience all of this — the building of the franchise — with the great city of Seattle. It’s just a blessing.</p><p>From the moment I got here, I’ve seen how badly this city has wanted hockey  — had been <em>waiting</em> for hockey. Even during our preseason games, I can just feel it in the air. This is a great sports town. I know what it means to be a hockey-obsessed kid in a city without an NHL team.</p><p>And for me?</p><p>I feel like I’ve been waiting my whole life for the Kraken, too. </p><hr /><p>At the end of the 2018 season, after all the bus breakdowns, I didn’t know what was next for me. </p><p>My time with the Senators was over. I had been through just about every level of their farm system, and there was no path forward there. I started to think about Europe, about what could be ahead for me. I’m one of those people who sort of plans for the worst and hopes for the best. I’d invested in some rental properties, hoping that they could be a secondary source of income. I’d had them for a little while at that point, so at the same time that I was riding buses in the minors, I was also a landlord. It was a bit of a weird thing to balance, to be honest. But it was important, because I didn’t know how much longer my hockey career would last. </p><p>That summer, I signed a less-than-ideal one-year contract to play for the Panthers’ AHL affiliate in Springfield, Massachussetts, slotting in at goalie No. 5 on the depth chart. If you do some math — two goalies in the NHL, two in the AHL — that meant that when everyone was healthy it’d be a one-way ticket back to the Coast.</p><p>If you’re a minor league hockey player, and you sign a deal with an organization that didn’t draft you, there’s something that they don’t include in the fine print — but it’s real and it’s important.</p><p>You aren’t <em>their</em> guy. </p><p>In Ottawa, I was somebody’s guy.</p><p>Even when I was in the Coast, I was still Ottawa’s guy.</p><blockquote>If I didn’t work out, it was no sweat off of anyone’s back. I wasn’t a black mark on the draft record of the GM.<cite>Chris Driedger</cite></blockquote><p>They had drafted me, developed me. They’d given me opportunities that I maybe hadn’t always deserved. They’d <em>really</em> wanted me to succeed. And that had almost lured me into this … lackadaisical attitude. I thought I was working hard. But I also knew I wasn’t the <em>hardest </em>working guy. When things wouldn’t go my way, my first response wasn’t to grind even harder. I’d skip voluntary workouts, I’d spend too many nights out with the guys. You can be told to work hard, but you still have to <em>learn</em> to do it, if that makes sense. I didn’t take my career for granted. I just got lost in it, almost. </p><p>But with the Panthers, I was just another guy. Nothing was given to me. It’s not that they didn’t treat me well. I have nothing but good things to say about everyone in Springfield, Manchester and Sunrise. But if I didn’t work out, it was no sweat off of anyone’s back. I wasn’t a black mark on the draft record of the GM, or some scout. I was just another prospect who didn’t make it. And trust me when I say that I <em>really</em> felt that. </p><p>I knew, deep down, that this was my last chance. And that put me into a mindset I hadn’t been able to find before. I finally realized I had no option but to put my head down, quit complaining and work. I finally found some <em>stillness</em>. </p><p>If I was going to get anywhere with the Panthers, I was going to earn it. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2497,h_1664,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhgtyw0ndwx3btr56t.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Dave Sandford/NHLI via Getty Images"><figcaption>Dave Sandford/NHLI via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>In Springfield, I had a really great relationship with my goalie coach, Leo Luongo. (Yep, Lou’s brother.) And I basically told him right off the bat, “Hey, man. Sometimes I get lazy. You need call me out on that right away. Don’t hesitate.” He held me accountable, and that allowed me to do the same with myself. I owe him a lot because he’s one of those guys where you can go out and make 40 saves, but if you let the 41st one in, he’ll go in-depth on how you can stop that one next time. An attitude of always improving — no matter what — was something I hadn’t quite grasped before I started working with Leo.</p><p>It was exactly what I needed at that point of my career. Because I ended up getting a bunch of starts toward the end of the 2019 AHL season and I played really well. Leo kept me so focused on just getting better that I didn’t really have a chance to pick up my head and see what I was doing. But next thing I knew I was signing a two-way NHL contract with Florida and … man, the dream was back on. Full-time landlord was going to have to wait. </p><p>A few months earlier I had been riding my millionth bus in the Coast, and now I was going to have the chance to challenge for an NHL job next season. </p><p>Challenge accepted.</p><p>I started the 2019–20 season in Springfield and picked up right where I left off — with a strong start. The Panthers noticed. I got called up in November of 2019 and never looked back. </p><p>After three years without a sniff, I was back in the NHL. </p><p>All of a sudden, I get to learn from a legend: Sergei Bobrovsky.</p><p>Bob, man.</p><p>Bob is the best. And the guy is also the ultimate pro. </p><blockquote>He’s upside down on a yoga mat, he’s on the treadmill, he’s stretching in ways I’ve literally never seen before.<cite>Chris Driedger</cite></blockquote><p>I remember when I got called up, I’d revamped my daily warmup routine to something much more thorough than what I had been doing previously. I was thinking,<em>  I’m going to do all this stretching and be the most prepared goalie in the league. </em></p><p>So I get to the rink, and I’ve got that <em>swagger, </em>you know? </p><p>I walk in the locker room, and Bob is deep in his process. He’s been there for what looks like two hours, he’s upside down on a yoga mat, he’s on the treadmill, he’s stretching in ways I’ve literally never seen before. He’s <em>grinding</em>. I couldn’t believe it. I mean … I guess I could. Two Vezinas. But still. And when I finished my routine, he was still going. </p><p>That’s Bob. He’s just on another level. The care he has for his craft … that’s what I learned from him.</p><p>I ended up getting a few starts and playing pretty well, and I remember him coming up to me after one of them, grabbing me on the shoulder, “You know, Chris, you’re pretty fun to watch. Keep it up man.” </p><p>That meant a lot because I was taking his starts, and some goalies can get weird about that. But he was right there for me, cheering me on. It takes a lot of confidence, a lot of maturity to act like that when you’re in his shoes. I’ll carry that with me. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2497,h_1664,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhgv4s0rgsbcwrkm0r.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Eliot J.

My agent informed me I’d be getting some sort of raise next season when I become a UFA. Eyeing up the Panthers goaltending budget, it didn’t seem like there was a whole lot of wiggle room for excess spending. Fair enough. </p><p>Now what?</p><p>I had been hearing rumblings about Seattle’s interest throughout the season. It seemed they had their eye on me.</p><p><em>Seattle?</em> </p><p><em>Sounds great. </em></p><blockquote>One day the bus is breaking down in Brampton, then I blink and I’m on the phone with Ron Francis negotiating a deal<cite>Chris Driedger</cite></blockquote><p>But my situation was a little weird. I didn’t have a contract for the 2021–22 season, so Seattle traded for the right to negotiate with me on a deal. That negotiation was one of the most exciting things I’ve ever been a part of. </p><p>One day the bus is breaking down in Brampton, then I blink and I’m on the phone with Ron Francis negotiating a deal with numbers I still can’t wrap my head around. </p><p>It sounded like if we waited until free agency I’d have some other options, but we reached agreement on financials and term. And seriously. Given the opportunity to be part of a brand new NHL team in an incredible city ... how could I say no? </p><p>This was all before the draft had taken place, so a lot of things were unknown about the Kraken.</p><p>And by a lot I mean ... everything.</p><p>In the past, when my agent and I would talk about offers — well, actually … let me be honest with you all: If we got an offer in the past … we were signing that thing pretty quick. But hypothetically, if my agent and I had to go over an offer, we might look at things like the average annual value, the length of the contract, the city — all that stuff. And so we’re looking at the offer from Seattle, and we get to the depth-chart portion of our talk, and we pause for a second. He looks at me.</p><p>“Ah, well ... you’d be the only player on the team.”</p><p>Risky, but what the hell. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Time for a leap of faith.</p><p> <em>Signed.</em></p><p>Chris Driedger, goalie for the SEATTLE KRAKEN.</p><p>Pretty cool.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhrewfz57np2dfkh9r.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Christopher Mast/NHLI via Getty Images"><figcaption>Christopher Mast/NHLI via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But, honestly, signing that deal … it meant so much to me. It’s hard for me to put into words what it was like to see my name at the bottom of a three-year NHL contract. </p><p>I thought of my parents, Cindy and Kelly. I remember my dad, who didn’t know much about playing goalie, taking notes from the stands at my camps when I was 10 years old so he could be better able to coach me during practice. </p><p>I thought of my buddy Liam, who shot tennis balls on me in his driveway when I was six ... my first experience as a goaltender. </p><p>I thought about all the goalie coaches over the years, from the WHL to the NHL, who didn’t give up on me. I get choked up thinking about how many people have put so much effort into getting me to where I am.</p><p>I’m so grateful, man.</p><p>It’s my name on the contract, but it’s really <em>all of ours. </em></p><p>I’m only here because of all the people around me. </p><p>The journey took some time, but I believe every step of it was worth it.</p><p>And so when I hear people in Seattle say they’ve been waiting years for the Kraken?</p><p>I nod my head. I get it. </p><p><em>Me too.</em></p><p>The organization has been world class. Everyone is all-in on making sure we hit the ground running, and that we’ll be a team that this city can be proud of. We’ve got a great group and I think we’re going to surprise some people this year. I really do. I thought there might be some growing pains, but everything has been incredible so far.</p><p>I can’t wait for opening night.</p><p>I can’t wait to see you show out, Seattle. It almost feels like Christmas morning, right?</p><p>Let’s drop the puck. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhgvsygyr2jxy2myr6.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>NHL</category></item><item><title>Milwaukee, I’ve Got Our Secret Weapon for the Playoffs</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/kolten-wong-milwaukee-brewers-mlb-baseball-playoffs?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Kolten Wong</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fh8nnswf6q</guid><description>Kolten Wong on the Milwaukee Brewers: “We’ve got each other’s backs, and we show one another so much love and support at all times.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:56:22 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2800,h_1575,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhbj3g92zhk5my59yh.jpg" caption="Michael R.

Let me tell you a little story.</p><p>It involves a hospital bed, an iPad, two incredible home runs, the most amazing wife on the planet, and a little dude named Kash Kaha Wong. Before today, only my wife and I knew this story, and Alissa will probably kill me for telling it. But I love our fans, and … you guys just really gotta hear this. </p><p>So here’s the deal: It’s a Saturday night in a delivery room at Froedtert Hospital early last month. Alissa and I are preparing for the arrival of our first child. She’s in the bed, and I have a little nook off to the side with a tiny couch that I’d slept on the night before. </p><p>Nurses are shuttling in and out. Machines are beeping. Things are clearly ramping up. </p><p>But then, also, on top of all that, a few miles down the road.… </p><p>The Brew Crew, my boys, just so happen to be playing the Cardinals. </p><blockquote>Before today, only my wife and I knew this story, and Alissa will probably kill me for telling it.<cite>Kolten Wong</cite></blockquote><p>So, I can’t help it, right? I have my iPad propped up against the wall by the couch, just so I can keep tabs on my guys in the background. </p><p>As the game’s about to start, it’s getting closer to go time for Alissa. I’m on the side of the bed holding one of her legs, and there’s a nurse on the other side holding the other one. I’m the designated countdown guy, so my job is to count down from nine to zero, while Alissa pushes — when I get to zero, she takes a break. And things are going great. Alissa’s breathing is perfect, and I’m counting down like a champ. Everything is going exactly according to plan. Until….</p><p>Back over my shoulder, I hear the announcers mention that my guy, Luis Urías, is about to step into the box and lead things off for the Brewers. </p><p>At first, I try to ignore it. Obviously. It’s like: <em>Dude, pull yourself together. Do your job!</em> But, at the same time, what can I tell you, I’m … well, <em>I’m me</em>. I love this team so much, and you gotta understand … Urías, he’s my double play partner, and a young guy. Ever since spring training, I’ve been doing everything I can to bond with him and build up his confidence, doing what guys did for me when I was younger. </p><p>Luis? I mean, I love that dude. I pull for him like crazy. </p><p>So, with my most serious, locked-in voice, I’m all: “Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, ZERO!!!!” </p><p>But, also, at the same time, in the back of my mind … I can’t help but want to check in on that first at bat for our side. </p><p><em>Just keep counting, Kolten. What are you doing right now? Lock in, dude! Don’t look at the game. </em></p><p>I held it together initially, too. I was good.</p><p>Nine, eight, seven, six.…</p><p>But then, right after Alissa finished one of her pushes and was taking a pause, the craziest thing happened. </p><p>It was almost like I got this tap on the shoulder. Like someone was telling me….</p><p>“Hey, dude, turn around just for one quick second <em>riiiiiiight … now</em>.”</p><p>I turn my head and look at the iPad, and, I kid you not: That was the exact moment when Luis launched a leadoff homer into the bullpen out in left center.</p><p>Boom! 1–0 Brewers. Just like that.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhbe1fvwftx0zr794a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Thearon W.

Oh man! OH MY GOSH!!!!”</p><p>Alissa, she’s just looking at me. Staring. Dead in the eye. </p><p>She’s like: “What? What is it? Tell me!”</p><p>I knew right away that I’d messed up. </p><p>“Well, um, it’s just that, um … Luis, he just hit a homer to start the game. So, you know … we’re already up 1–0. Pretty cool.”</p><p><em>Ooooooooof. </em></p><blockquote>I’m holding onto one of my wife’s legs and screaming, “Oh gosh. Oh man! OH MY GOSH!!!!”<cite>Kolten Wong</cite></blockquote><p>And Alissa, in that moment, God bless her … she doesn’t pop me in the mouth, or give me the stink eye. She understands. Alissa, she <em>knows</em> me. </p><p>“Oh, nice!” she says with a smile. </p><p>Then, after about a two-second pause, she says…. </p><p>“NOW FOCUS!”</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1498,h_998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhbeemkkfxq0q3a540.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Kolten Wong"><figcaption>Courtesy of Kolten Wong</figcaption></figure><p>Not too long after that, our healthy baby boy, Kash, arrived. And, not even 18 hours later, Vogie hit that huge walk-off grand slam to beat the Cards and … I may or may not have screamed so loud that it woke up the baby. </p><p>I guess you could say I’m still kinda getting the hang of this whole fatherhood thing. But, more important … talk about a pretty special 24-hour stretch, huh?</p><p>And a big part of why it was so special — and why I’ll always remember it, as long as I live — has to do with the city of Milwaukee.</p><p>It has to do with my teammates, of course, and the entire Brewers organization. But also just so many other wonderful, thoughtful people throughout this town. All the doctors and nurses at Froedtert, who took such great care of Alissa. And the people in our neighborhood who sent over gift baskets when we came home with Kash. It actually even goes back to everyone who welcomed us to this city when we first got here and made us immediately feel like a part of the community. I mean, our new neighbors literally baked us pies and brought them over when we first moved in. I thought that only happened on TV shows.  </p><p>But it turns out, no … it happens in Milwaukee, too.</p><blockquote>Our new neighbors literally baked us pies and brought them over when we first moved in.<cite>Kolten Wong</cite></blockquote><p>Before I became a Brewer, basically all I knew about Milwaukee was that the downtown area seemed cool, and that I liked the steaks at Carnevor.

Let me just be straight up about it: I really admire Christian and Lorenzo. They’re consummate professionals. They go about things the right way, and as good as they are as players … they’re even better people. </p><p>Yeli, even though we’re close in age, seeing what he’s accomplished in his career already? And how he’s gone about it? He’s definitely someone I look up to. Just the knowledge he has about his craft, and how he goes about his business day in and day out, good times and bad … that’s something that’s been massively influential for me. And Lorenzo, man … that guy’s our rock. He keeps everything so laid back and fun. And now he’s also my fatherhood guru, too. Lo’s got three boys. He’s been there. He’s like my sensei. </p><p>So with teammates like Lorenzo, and Yeli, and Vogie and, man, I can’t forget my fishing buddy, Jace … guys like that, I feel like I’d do anything to help those guys win a World Series for this incredible town.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2997,h_1998,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhbf21gp438m1mw3wz.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Ross D.

As crazy as it may sound, it might not be enough for me and my teammates to do all we can to bring a World Series trophy to Milwaukee.

Well, I mean, what can I say? Now — right now, and all throughout these playoffs — is the time to show the entire world why Milwaukee holds that crown. </p><p>Pack the park. Let us hear you.

Believe me.  </p><p>And, look, good news … if it comes down to it, and we end up needing just a tiny little bit more mojo during these playoffs — a secret weapon if you will — I’m pretty sure my boy Kash has this uncanny magical power that somehow makes Brewers batters hit big home runs.</p><p>I mean, whatever it takes, right?</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1080,h_607,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/theplayertribune/01fhbh7w05raed2v3ecq.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>MLB</category></item><item><title>All That Matters Is What Happens Next</title><link>https://www.theplayerstribune.com/posts/harrison-bader-st-louis-cardinals-mlb-baseball-playoffs?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Harrison Bader</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fh460xz0tf</guid><description>Harrison Bader has a message for St. Louis: “I believe that this team deserves to go deep into the playoffs, that we belong.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 13:47:38 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RlfRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAMAA4BA-2f5bf166713e443cdccdf09519608b2f.jpg" caption="Jeff Roberson/AP Photo"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Harrison Bader"></flatplan:author><keywords>MLB,BASEBALL,harrison bader ,St. Louis Cardinals,playoffs ,Cardinals</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seventeen games?</p><p>In a row?</p><p>Without losing? Seventeen? In the big leagues? </p><p>Are you kidding me?</p><p>It’s almost unbelievable when you sit back and think about it. Seems like it’d be impossible. And as a player, someone who was right in the middle of it all, I gotta tell you … one of the best things about that streak was something that didn’t even take place on the field. Something that, in the grand scheme of things, is actually bigger than a bunch of W’s checked off on a schedule.  </p><p>I think the best way to put it is: If you’re a ballplayer, there’s simply nothing like pulling on <a href="https://www.theplayerstribune.com/videos/harrison-bader-spring-training-cardinals" target="_blank">that Cardinals jersey</a> and going out and doing something special for the people of St. Louis.</p><p>Someone who’s never been to a game here when our team is really humming, or guys in the league who’ve never played for the Cardinals? They wouldn’t understand. They just wouldn’t. And I don’t hold it against them. I don’t blame them for hearing talk about how special this city’s bond with the Cardinals is, or reading this article, and being like, “Yeah, yeah, blah, blah, blah, whatever.” Because … how could they know? </p><p>It’s not their fault. </p><p>But let me try to make it as clear as I can. As somebody who is fortunate enough to suit up for this franchise and play in front of these fans … I really do believe that adds up to the ultimate honor in the game. And then, when you have success, and you’re going full steam and get on a roll and basically almost become one with the fans, for my money … there’s just nothing that can compare. </p><p>The fact that me and my teammates can bring joy — real, legit joy — to the lives of people in this city? I value and appreciate that so much. I hold that sacred. </p><p>So, to go on this run with my teammates over the past few weeks, and then to see and hear from our fans about how happy we’ve made them? That’s been truly special. </p><p>It’s something I’ll never forget.  </p><blockquote>If you’re a ballplayer, there’s simply nothing like pulling on that Cardinals jersey and going out and doing something special for the people of St. Louis.<cite>Harrison Bader</cite></blockquote><p>But, at the same time, with all that being said, let’s be real about something right now: As awesome as these past few weeks have been, as fun as they’ve been, as unforgettable … those games, all those wins, they don’t really matter at this point.</p><p>What matters is how this team shows up and performs <em>right now</em>, in these playoffs. How we play when everything is on the line. </p><p>What matters is what happens next.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RihRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAMAA4BA-bafb8ed20c83925dac3f9d347c15a107.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Jeff Dean/AP Photo"><figcaption>Jeff Dean/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>For me, as a player, the streak … it’s history. </p><p>It’s over. </p><p>That run we went on is just one chapter in the overall story of our season.</p><p>It’s no secret that, for much of the year, things didn’t go as we would’ve hoped. And, early on, a lot of us … it seemed like we let it get to us. We got frustrated. It was something our manager, Mike Shildt, noticed. Something we had to work through, both as individuals and as a team.</p><p>The guys in our clubhouse have accomplished a ton over the years. And as players, we all take that history, those expectations, into every single game. So when you feel like you’re underperforming — based on the version of the player you’ve been in the past — when you feel like you’re letting your teammates down, letting the city down, it weighs on you.</p><p>Speaking for myself, being on the IL early, and then struggling to get things going with the bat after coming back, and then scuffling again in August with overthinking everything and getting too mechanical … it’s definitely been tough at times.  </p><p>I think the biggest thing for me was just to ask myself on a daily basis what my team needed from me. It was like: <em>If I’m not hitting right now, then screw it. I’m gonna go make a diving catch, or I’m gonna get dirty out there. I’ll do anything I can to help.</em></p><p>And it seems like, as the season progressed, a lot of guys were doing something similar. I think that was a big reason why we went on our run. In some ways we all kind of took the pressure off ourselves as individuals. And when you displace that pressure and shed the weight of feeling like you have to do it on your own, you free yourself up. You become more intentional, more team-oriented, more dangerous. </p><p>Even as late as mid-July, we were still like three or four games under .500. But I think we all just eventually hit a point where it was almost like: <em>I don’t care about my stats. I’m going to find a way to do at least one thing well for this team today to help us win.</em> And when you have 26 guys with that mentality, winning gets contagious because it becomes all about how we fit into the puzzle <em>together</em>. </p><p>That’s when things start to really get fun. </p><blockquote>I don’t care about my stats. I’m going to find a way to do at least one thing well for this team today to help us win.<cite>Harrison Bader</cite></blockquote><p>Over this last stretch, I’ve definitely seen guys embracing that fun — the joy that goes along with playing as a team and seeing the results pay off again and again.   </p><p>You see it, of course, with guys like DeJong and Knizner. And me? I started talking <em>even more</em> s*** to my guys during the streak — getting on dudes for mismatching their clothes, or busting on teammates about a rough haircut. But I feel like that fun factor … it’s been even more evident in someone like Goldy.</p><p>That guy — I mean, I’ve been fortunate enough to have been around him for three seasons now, and I truly do idolize him as a teammate. He’s an amazing baseball player, an amazing athlete. But I’ve never seen that guy smile more than he has this past month. I’ve never seen him laugh more or make more jokes. </p><p>And then he locks in like crazy at game time. </p><p>In a lot of ways, it’s just emblematic of where we all are right now. And it’s something we can continue to build on.   </p><p>Everyone is taking the pressure off themselves, and that enabled us to come up big at the exact right moment.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SQvRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAMAA4BA-4c3af631a9cdda052e446e6f6c99081f.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Kamil Krzaczynski/USA Today Sports"><figcaption>Kamil Krzaczynski/USA Today Sports</figcaption></figure><p>This October, we just have to carry that vibe over into the playoffs and show that we truly belong among the best teams in baseball. </p><p>It’s up to us to make that happen in <em>this</em> moment. </p><p>The teams we’re going to play won’t care about that winning streak. They’re not going to somehow be scared or play worse against us because we won a bunch of games last month.

I mean, come on now. </p><p>The leadership qualities present in those two guys are off the charts, and if we make a run here in the playoffs those two are going to be a big reason why.</p><p>Waino, throughout the whole season, that guy has been just as solid and as dependable as ever. He’s the model, man. If you’re a pitcher — any pitcher … starter, middle reliever, closer, whatever — he’s the guy. He’s done it all, and he’s had success in every role possible. Now, 16 years into his career, he is no doubt the spine of our pitching staff. He’s the spine of the most important part of our team. </p><p>Dude is 40 years old, or whatever it is, and still doing it at a very high level every time he takes the mound. That conviction, that mind-set, it’s contagious. The presence that he provides is absolutely crucial to our team. </p><p>And it’s the same deal with Yadi. </p><p>I mean, you want to talk about presence? Yadier Molina exudes presence. </p><p>That’s the calmest, coolest cat I’ve ever met. And as athletes, as competitors, everyone on this team benefits from that. I’ve learned so much just by listening to and watching Yadi. He knows how much energy and how much focus it takes to win a World Series, and he’s just such a good example of somebody who applies every single ounce of his energy toward the task at hand every day. He never gets rattled, always stays cool. </p><p>And with both him and Waino, even aside from ball, you’re just talking about great people — both Roberto Clemente Award winners. So believe me when I say that I have never for one second taken for granted a good morning from Yadi or a hug from Waino after a big win. My level of respect for those guys can’t even be put into words. </p><p>I trust them completely, and I would never bet against them leading this team to the pinnacle of our profession. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RfVRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAJAA4BA-1e7af11161bee87fad06f0a1c7a00645.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Kareem Elgazzar/The Cincinnati Enquirer"><figcaption>Kareem Elgazzar/The Cincinnati Enquirer</figcaption></figure><p>Now it’s just gonna come down to our resolve — this team’s ability to follow the lead those guys set and lock in and get it done out on the field. </p><p>There’s nothing magical to what’s about to happen.</p><p>All that stuff about: “This is meant to be. It’s fate. We’re destined to win!” </p><p>That’s all bulls*** if you ask me. </p><p>That’s a fantasy. It’s not real. </p><p>What’s real — what counts — is what we actually <em>do</em>.

And that we can play with anyone right now. </p><p>I truly believe that if this team — top to bottom, all 26 of us — if we just play ball, and do our thing, and keep it simple, we’re going to win the World Series. </p><p>That belief only goes so far, though. </p><p>If we don&#39;t go out there and do it, starting right away with this wild-card game, then we actually <em>don’t</em> belong. </p><p>There’s no margin for error here.  </p><p>It’s show up for real or ... pack up your s***.</p><p>Period.  </p><p>But when you have all of St. Louis behind you — pulling for you like crazy, showing the love and support that our fans are known for — this team, all of us in that clubhouse, we can feel unstoppable sometimes.</p><p>And you know what?

And for whatever reason, my mind kept taking me back to this one particular plane ride near the end of 2010.</p><p>I was with the Vikings at the time, and I forget what city we were in, but we had just finished playing a night game. It was late, and we had gotten beat, so as we boarded the plane everyone was hurting, pissed-off, and reliving all of the plays we would’ve loved to have had back. </p><p>I remember finding my seat, getting comfortable, ready to head home and move forward, and then … we just sat there. </p><p>The plane didn’t move an inch for what seemed like hours. In reality, it was probably only around 45 minutes. But after a loss? With everyone just wanting to get home and go to bed? You <em>know</em> that 45 minutes seemed like it would never end. It was just like….</p><p>Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick…. </p><p>Everyone was looking at their watches and shifting in their seats while looking at each other — pisstivity growing, banged-up bodies throbbing, as we continued ruminating over mistakes that had cost us the game. Until, at one point, one of the guys who worked on travel arrangements for the Vikings walked up the aisle, followed closely by two big airport security guards, and they stopped at my row. </p><p>Suddenly, everyone was looking at <em>me</em>. </p><p>“I’m really sorry about this, Husain,” the Vikings guy said to me, and then paused. I could tell he was uncomfortable — just kind of fidgety, looking off to the side. </p><p>I had no clue what he meant, or what was going on.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, man … but I’m gonna need to see your I.D.”</p><p>Even after he said it to me, it still took a second or two for it to register. Then, all at once, it hit me.</p><p><em>They’re holding up this plane because of YOU. Because of YOUR NAME. You’re on some list because of your name! </em></p><p>Wow.</p><blockquote>They’re holding up this plane because of YOU. Because of YOUR NAME.<cite>Husain Abdullah</cite></blockquote><p>At that moment, I gotta be honest, part of me wanted to go off. I was about to lose my cool….</p><p>“I’m a Minnesota Viking! I’m a part of this team! Everyone here knows me!” </p><p>And in my head it was like: <em>I’m a loving husband, a great dad, a family man. I’m a decent human being. And you got these two big dudes with their security jackets looking like they’re about to pull me out of my seat right now?  </em></p><p>I wanted to look those dudes in the eye and say: “Hell, nah, y’all can go kick rocks. You do realize you’re asking me for my identification, on our team plane, after I just played in a football game with all these guys?”</p><p>I’m always conscious of the angry-Black-man stereotype, however. So … I got out my wallet, calmly opened it up, and then handed the man my I.D. </p><p>Ten minutes later, it was wheels up. </p><p>Before I knew it, we were back home in Minnesota. </p><p>No one ever spoke of it again. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j2wCEAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBA-ceb4d9530a569a7bb4178c3fbb8d4a8d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Becca Estrella/The Player' Tribune"><figcaption>Becca Estrella/The Player' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>My whole, entire life changed with 9/11. </p><p>Lots of us can say that, I realize. All of us, really. I know that. I don’t mean to discount that in any way. But when your name is Husain Ibn Muhammad Abdullah, and you’re a Muslim of strong and deep faith? When that’s who you are at the core … your life really, really, really changes after something like 9/11 takes place. </p><p>Prior to 2001, growing up in Southern California, the fact that I was a Muslim never really led to anything super negative or worrisome. I remember when I was really little, during the war in Iraq, someone on the playground called me Saddam one time. But to be honest with you, I squashed that immediately. I set that boundary. Couldn’t have been more clear — like, “Hey! What’d you say? Haha, yeah. Real funny. If I hear it again, you’re gonna have to catch my fade.” </p><p>It never happened again. </p><p>I had small, insignificant experiences of Islamophobia as a kid.  </p><p>After 9/11, though, everything was different.</p><p>Immediately.   </p><p>I was a junior in high school at the time, and on that particular Tuesday I was listening to Big Boy in the Morning on Power 106 while I was getting dressed. I still remember it. Right before his phone-taps skit started, he announced that a plane had hit a skyscraper in New York. When I heard that, I thought maybe the pilot of a small plane had passed out or something, but by the time I got to school I realized how serious everything was. No one was doing any work, we were all just glued to the TVs they rolled into all our classrooms. Then the bell would ring, and we’d all just walk to a different classroom and watch a different TV.   </p><p>Before long, reporters started talking about it being an attack, a terrorist attack. The news began blending the words <em>Muslim</em> and <em>Islam</em> with terrorism and violence. And then, not too long after that — just like a few minutes or so — stuff started to get ugly at my school.</p><p>At one point, a few kids ran up and surrounded some young, hijab-wearing, Muslim women at center quad. They were screaming and shouting all sorts of slurs at the girls, threatening them, looking to place their hurt and aggression on someone defenseless. My cousin, Muhammad, stepped in to intervene like, “Nah — y’all gonna have to catch my fade. You know you’re wrong. If you want to harm these women, you’re gonna have to fight me first!”</p><p>Literally, a 16-year-old had to stand up in front of a growing mob of kids, like some shield or something. A protector of people he barely knew. It actually came to that. And had he not been there, who knows what would have happened? </p><p>There were some Sikh students at our school who, after a few days, they basically just disappeared. They withdrew from the school because of how they were treated by other students. They were just unmercifully harassed. Nonstop. </p><p>It was just really, really sad.   </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j2wCEAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBA-b322d19d5add47f4a8fdabad0a81afb8.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>When it came to me more directly, though, as an individual, and how I was treated in the immediate aftermath, something maybe not so predictable went on. </p><p>There’s obviously no confusion about who I am, what I’m all about. My name kind of says it all. I am Muslim through and through. And I could just feel something in the air, how kids started looking at me differently. There was a different vibe in the weeks after 9/11. Like a suspicion. But then, on the other hand … they <em>knew</em> me.  </p><p>So they’re looking at me like: <em>Wait, this dude is … he’s cool. He’s a nice person. I’ve known him since kindergarten</em>. Or, <em>We ran track together</em>. Or, <em>He once helped me out when I fell down at recess</em>, or whatever.  Like, <em>I actually know him. I know what he’s about.</em>   </p><p>There was this mashup of, <em>Well, this guy is supposed to be the enemy … but I know he’s actually not the enemy</em>. </p><blockquote>All of a sudden, in so many ways big and small, I was being expected to speak on behalf of two billion people, about a religion with almost 1,500 years of history. <cite>Husain Abdullah</cite></blockquote><p>In other settings, outside of school, those relationships couldn’t help me in the same way. And there were new challenges I had to deal with. For starters, after 9/11, everything about my Muslim-ness became amplified and more prominent to the outside world. </p><p>That next year, a local newspaper did an article focused on me and my cousin being Muslim and playing football, and how we combined the two. It was cool overall, and we got to talk about our faith and why it mattered so much to us. But, at the same time, it also made it clear to me that there was going to be a lot expected of me when it came to talking about Islam — that I needed to get fully caught up <em>quick</em>. Not only in terms of understanding Islam as a faith, but also learning the intricacies of world politics.</p><p>It was like, all of a sudden, in so many ways big and small, I was being expected to speak on behalf of two billion people, about a religion with almost 1,500 years of history. </p><p>At 17.</p><p>It was … heavy. </p><p>Before that, I’d been super quiet, an introvert. But after 9/11, I felt like I couldn’t just <em>not talk</em>. I couldn’t just stand by and let mistruths go unchecked. And there were lots of times when I felt like I was out of my element, and speaking on things I didn’t know enough about. </p><p>So, basically, I learned more. I took on the challenge of learning more about my religion and tried my best to help those around me understand what it meant to be a Muslim. In some ways, now that I’m sitting here thinking about it, that’s kind of the story of my adult life — striving to be a good Muslim, to learn as much as I can about Islam, being an ambassador for my faith, while also dispelling myths along the way.  </p><p>Of course, those efforts aren’t made any easier when media portrayals, movies, video games, and sensationalized “news” on TV all tend to feed into stereotypes or paint an entire religion as evil. And just in case you thought that maybe being a professional athlete would insulate me from that stuff, I can tell you that definitely hasn’t been the case.</p><blockquote>Striving to be a good Muslim, to learn as much as I can about Islam, being an ambassador for my faith, while also dispelling myths along the way.  <cite>Husain Abdullah</cite></blockquote><p>Let’s see … one that always springs to mind is the reporter who came at me in front of a crowded gathering of media and berated me for fasting when Ramadan happened during training camp — because, he said, it was <em>putting the Vikings at risk</em> of liability if I died.</p><p>Like, for real.</p><p>“How could you put the Vikings in this position?”</p><p>He was gaslighting me while others wanted to learn more about the beauty of Ramadan. </p><p>Speaking of Ramadan, another time, an exec from a team I was playing for once pleaded with my agent for me to find better friends to kick it with. My agent was puzzled, knowing I pretty much went to work, went home, and only went out to team functions, he asked the exec why?</p><p>The man then told him that my friend Ramadan was having me out so late at night, he was afraid I wouldn’t have the energy to perform.</p><p>I just had to laugh when the story finally reached me.</p><p>Or, during my first or second year with the Chiefs, when a newspaper ran an article about me fasting, and, you know, the article itself was fine. But the layout?</p><p><em>Maaaaan</em>.</p><p>Get this: Directly to the right of my photo, there was a huge headline about, you guessed it ...<em> terrorists</em>. With the natural fold of the paper, you’d see my picture right next to some bold type about a terrorist. So people who just glanced at it….</p><p>I mean, come on.  </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j2wCEAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBA-2ca0fb905ae54a89037dce1e94ce8443.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, there were a lot of situations like those — certainly more than I have space to recount here. But I guess one silver lining is that, to me, that stuff was much more difficult and disappointing than anything I ever experienced with most of my teammates and coaches during my football career. </p><p>In fact, it was like the field or the locker room, those were almost like safe havens for me. The only thing that mattered in those settings was whether or not you could play ball. In some ways, being able to hunker down in those places made things easier and better for me overall as a practicing Muslim.</p><p>Even just with prayer, being in a football setting actually made being a devout Muslim <em>less</em> difficult sometimes. We pray five times a day — before the sun rises, right after noon, in the afternoon, at sunset, and then one last time at night — and when I wasn’t at the facility, sometimes it’d be really rough finding a place to pray. I’d be at a mall, and it would be time to pray, and it’d be like ... I’d have to pretend like, “Hey, I need a new T-shirt, but I’m not sure if this fits me, can I try it on?” And then I’d go into the fitting room and pray. Or I’d be stuck outside somewhere and have to pray in freezing cold temperatures.    </p><p>But at the facility — at least after I got my legs under me and felt more confident and had gone on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 2012 — I was able to just ask my coaches if I could use their offices to pray whenever the time came. And those guys, they always were more than happy to let me do that. Coach Dino in K.C., and ET, Emmitt Thomas, those guys were super kind to help me out in whatever way they could, and they made sure I was able to give my faith the priority it deserves. ET actually called me into the office to make sure that when I prayed, I did so in his office.</p><p>What was even cooler, though, was that being in football provided the opportunity for some real learning to take place, and for some of the coolest, most impactful conversations I’ve ever been a part of. </p><p>It would usually start out really simple or basic, or be based on some confusion. Like: “Hey, Husain, are you from the Nation of Islam?” Or, “Are you Sunni or Shia?” Or, “Who’s doing all the attacking right now over in the Middle East?”</p><p>Lots of times the questions were misguided, but they always showed a level of curiosity, a willingness to learn. I loved that. And you know what? Sometimes I’d actually be like, “Shoot, I’m trying to figure out all the details of what’s going on just like you are.” </p><p>There was always an underlying respect present, in both directions.  </p><p>Now, of course, guys used to joke and clown around a lot — tease me about how there was bacon on top of some donuts in the locker room, or ask me if they could convert to Islam just to have multiple wives or whatnot. But I always went right back at them, just like we would with anything else. And I always thought those players were the most curious. They actually wanted to know more.</p><p>I mean, that same bacon dude once came up to me like, “Hey, Husain,” almost kinda hushed. “Who is Allah?”</p><p>It was <em>awesome</em>!</p><p>Then it was: “How is He different from the God that I worship?”</p><p>And….</p><p>“What about Jesus? What do you guys think about Jesus?”</p><p>“And who’s this Muhammad person I hear about sometimes?”</p><p>“Hey, and why do you guys have to pray five times a day? Like, why five?”</p><p>And on and on like that. </p><p>From there, we had tons of insightful conversations.</p><p>At one point, me and a few of my teammates formed our own little … I guess you’d call it a discussion circle, or a prayer group or something. But it was a true fellowship — again, all based on mutual respect. We’d sit around, and they’d be in their Bibles, I’d be in the Quran. And it was like, “Oh, I read this verse last night,” or, “This other verse I just read on our off day was really cool.”</p><p>Doesn’t get much better than that.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j2wCEAAEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBAQEBA-c6da706ce7e32eef42056f83899dd438.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Becca Estrella/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, more than anything, I’m just really thankful that I had so many supportive coaches and teammates over the years. Those individuals, and the kindness they showed me on a regular basis, really have helped me to navigate the post-9/11 world. Those experiences of feeling respected and supported and loved, have helped me deal with the challenges and unfair treatment that America has placed upon Muslims in other contexts. </p><p>They helped me to appreciate the value and importance of kindness even more than I already did, and that made me a better person overall. No doubt about it.  </p><p>Now, of course, I’d be lying if I tried to tell you that the Islamophobic stuff I’ve experienced over the years didn’t get to me sometimes — that it was easy to just shrug off those incidents, that they didn’t affect me in the least. That’s just not real life.  </p><p>After that reporter came at me about fasting during training camp for Ramadan, I can remember walking back to the locker room, looking down, and noticing that my hands were shaking. Like just uncontrollably shaking. Because I was so upset. </p><p>And on that airplane, when I had to present my I.D.? Oh man….</p><p>Don’t even get me started. </p><p>In those moments, though, I always try to remind myself to take the high road. That is always the best approach. I do my best to behave in the character and the mannerisms of the prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and I just strive to win people over with kindness, love, and with prophetic character. </p><p>The prophetic mission was simple, after stressing the worship of The Creator alone, he said, “I was sent to perfect good character.”</p><p>Basically by loving for others what you love for yourself.</p><p>I truly believe in my heart of hearts that’s the best way to live. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-11978e642041a07a47fd52a8f9f36a97.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]></content:encoded><category>TO</category></item></channel></rss>
