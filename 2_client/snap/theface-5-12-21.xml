Shot in Nice in the South of France, it showcases the city’s impressive architecture and rich history just as much as it does Slimane’s clothes. </p><p dir="ltr">But make no mistake: this is all about Celine. </p><p dir="ltr">The opening shot sees a&nbsp;branded ship cruising into the bay, before panning onto the renowned, 18<sup class="ordinal">th</sup>-century Promenade des Anglais, the Hotel Negresco (customised with a&nbsp;giant Celine logo), the Villa Massena Museum and the Nice Observatory. It’s a&nbsp;blissful, sun-soaked afternoon. Little wonder the models are strutting along one of Europe’s best-known seafronts with a&nbsp;spring in their step. </p><p dir="ltr">To the endlessly cool strains of Can’s 1972 deep cut <em>Vitamin C</em>, rapid-fire images of spinning vinyl and landscapes are interspersed with black and white shots of Celine regulars Kaia Gerber and Blackpink’s Lisa Manobal. Along the riviera, a&nbsp;sharp black blazer is paired with a&nbsp;bralette, a&nbsp;bodycon sequin skirt and platform trainers, setting the scene for a&nbsp;collection filled with glamour and shine. </p><p dir="ltr">Sequins are a&nbsp;recurring theme throughout the collection. Not only do they adorn a&nbsp;khaki loungewear hoodie and tracksuit co-ord, but also a&nbsp;figure-hugging, cowl-neck dress with a&nbsp;matching clutch bag, and golden pussybow shirts with bouffant sleeves, worn with knee-length jersey shorts. </p><p dir="ltr">These are garments to take you smoothly from day to night, understated and luxurious in the same breath.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Ivory crocheted tunics and explorers’ hats are emblazoned with Celine’s logo, allowing the collection to segue into more sporty territory, via oversized, logoed hoodies, varsity-style bomber jackets and camo parkas. </p><p dir="ltr">Straw hats make an appearance, too, as do oversized pinstripe shirts and low-slung camo trousers worn with kitten heels. The Celine woman epitomises relaxed, French cool and this SS22 collection continues that tradition, ramping up evening wear while keeping wardrobe staples pared back.</p><p dir="ltr">Double-breasted, bolero-style cardigans with structured shoulders help to elevate skin-tight, off-the-shoulder crop-tops, often paired with leather pencil skirts and jackets. Some are mohair and pastel coloured, accessorised with plenty of signature sunnies. Lightweight crimson leathers, trench coats and denim give the collection a&nbsp;casual edge, contrasted with charming peplum tops and a&nbsp;floral dress with a&nbsp;gathered, asymmetrical hem. </p><p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;collection oozing with freedom, Hedi Slimane captures everything a&nbsp;long, hot summer on the Côte d’Azur should be: alluring, high-spirited and always full of life. <em>Angélique</em> indeed.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="1190077"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_93.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="900" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_92.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_91.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_85.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_84.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_83.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_82.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_81.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/CELINE_WOMEN_SUMMER22_WEB_80.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="800" height="1200" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="1190078"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

Following the 41-year-old’s untimely death on Sunday 28<sup>th</sup> November, it was announced that his SS22 presentation – scheduled to take place in Miami during <a href="https://theface.com/search?query=miami+art+basel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Art Basel</a> – would go ahead at the request of him and his family. This would be little more than 48&nbsp;hours after the news broke of his passing.</p><p dir="ltr">Little wonder that the atmosphere on the ground in Miami this week has been deeply sombre – Abloh spent much time working on projects in the city, particularly during Art Basel. But the mood last night was one of immense celebration as the show took place at the Miami Marine Stadium, a&nbsp;remote, disused venue on the city waterfront.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--instagram-embed " data-block="1189330"><div class="content-builder__block--xs content-builder__block--instagram-inner"><div><blockquote class="instagram-media"  data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW7xwZHNa9U/" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:540px; min-width:326px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);">Loading...</blockquote><script async src="//www.instagram.com/embed.js"></script></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--button " data-block="1189329"><div class="content-builder__block--m copy"><a

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1184477"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>WTF is bloghouse,” read a&nbsp;2008 post on the iconic, now-defunct blog <em>Hipster Runoff.</em> While the platform was known for its irony and satire of indie culture, the post unwittingly christened the dance music microgenre people often love to hate.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Shutter shades, warehouse parties, scruffy bands with synths and headbanging DJs pumping out roof-raising, garish anthems in the name of togetherness – bloghouse was a&nbsp;neon-coloured version of DIY punk, a&nbsp;free-for-all cultural phenomenon powered by Hype Machine, MySpace and an <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>anything goes” ethos. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Teeming with lo-fi bootlegs and lawsuit-ready mashups that wouldn’t stand a&nbsp;chance online nowadays, bloghouse (which was also given the much-contested tag <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>nu rave” in the UK by the <em>NME</em>) exploded during the mid-’00s and shamelessly reaped the benefits of broadband back when the internet was a&nbsp;very different place. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Nothing was really monetised, I&nbsp;don’t think for the reason that nobody wanted to do so, but I&nbsp;think because no one knew how,” suggests writer and FACE contributor <a href="https://theface.com/contributors/lina-abascal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lina Abascal</a>, whose forthcoming book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0578983001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Never Be Alone Again: How Bloghouse United the Internet and the Dancefloor</em></a> features interviews with some of the era’s key figures.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Abascal came of party age just as bloghouse was taking off in the US. She made the natural leap from hardcore punk to bloghouse, where dancefloor moshing and parent-bothering noise freakouts abounded, and where the idea of fostering community through music had simply moved online. In the early days of bloghouse, Abascal was studying at high school in LA. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I had a&nbsp;fake ID and was going out a&nbsp;lot in Hollywood,” she recalls. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>There were a&nbsp;lot of underage parties that were playing bloghouse music because it was just getting so big in LA.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">According to Abascal, the core years of bloghouse took place in 2006 – 2011, and she connects the movement to a&nbsp;plethora of blogs and artists, from rappers to guitar-wielding dance-rock bands and disco-friendly producers. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>The method of distribution was ultimately the uniting factor; all of these things were basically being blogged about,” says Abascal. But there was no real definitive sound. It was everything mashed together, like a&nbsp;hedonistic trifle of sugary jelly and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-shACMaxUb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ice cream</a> topped with a&nbsp;techno-punk cherry. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Whatever you think of bloghouse, its place in internet music history and its influence on mainstream dance music can’t be denied. As bloghouse started to fade out, EDM and pyrotechnics-fuelled <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>stadium banger shit” began to rear its head. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I think that bloghouse ended up being this market test for: is there an appetite in America for dance music? And it proved to be yes,” offers Abascal.</p><p dir="ltr">Bloghouse nurtured scenes and sounds all over the world, from French touch and London electro to Australian synth-pop and US rap. It was a&nbsp;cultural experiment and work-in-progress, defined by reinvention and not without its fair share of embarrassing or dubious moments. Here, Abascal picks out six of her favourite tracks to discuss their significance and era-defining place within the bloghouse canon. In the words of Nathan Barley’s Ned Smanks, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>keep it foolish!</em>”</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

This was originally a&nbsp;rock song by the UK band Simian, called <em>Never Be Alone</em>, which came out in 2002. <br></p><p dir="ltr">So Simian did a&nbsp;remix contest because that was a&nbsp;way to get songs going at the time. Justice entered the remix contest and they didn’t win. Nobody knew who they were, Simian were <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>we’re not picking that one – next!” A&nbsp;couple of years later, they revisited the remix, and at this point Justice were signed to Ed Banger records. So it ends up birthing this song.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Justice were essentially remixing the Simian song, Simian were remixing their own rock song, and then they went on to form Simian Mobile Disco, which is their dance offshoot of Simian with two of the band’s members, James Ford and Jas Shaw. They went on to have this whole career of their own, kind of riding off of a&nbsp;remix of their old rock band’s song. So the rebirth, and reusing all of these parts, and working together – feels very bloghouse to me, but also, it has such a&nbsp;memorable chorus and hook. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1184481"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Bloc Party – <em>Helicopter</em> (Weird Science remix) ft.

Were you a&nbsp;fan?</strong><br><br>Bloc Party were massive in the US. I&nbsp;love Bloc Party. Actually, right before Covid hit, I&nbsp;went to the<em> Silent Alarm</em> (the band’s 2004 debut album) anniversary tour. But I&nbsp;also saw Bloc Party when I&nbsp;was in high school. I&nbsp;loved dancey rock music. I&nbsp;loved The Faint, and I&nbsp;loved The Rapture and bands like that.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does this track embody the essence of bloghouse?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Helicopter</em> was a&nbsp;big song, but then once you get the Peaches remix and then also you throw in Weird Science, which I&nbsp;guess was this attempt at a&nbsp;supergroup that never got big – featuring Steve Aoki and Blake Miller from the band Moving Units – and you get their take on it, it’s just <em>so</em> bloghouse. You take a&nbsp;song that’s like a&nbsp;dancey rock band, you throw in this weirdo post-electroclash rapper and then you give it a&nbsp;remix by these two club Hollywood people. It’s an example of this culture clash with so many people all on one song coming together in different ways. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you feel like it introduced Peaches and encapsulated the vocal element of bloghouse?<br></strong><br>Peaches obviously set a&nbsp;blueprint for rappers like Uffie and then Kesha and so on. Bloghouse <em>loved</em> a&nbsp;vocal edit. Having vocals makes it easier for people to identify the songs. We didn’t have Shazam. So if you’re hearing a&nbsp;song that has no vocals, how can you look it up? How are you gonna know what it is, unless you can see it on the Serato or whatever, or the vinyl. And so a&nbsp;lot of the big songs I&nbsp;selected here, not by coincidence, are songs that have vocals.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1184484"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Kid Sister – <em>Pro Nails</em> (remix) ft.

Kid Sister is a&nbsp;Chicago-based rapper, the sister of Josh Young who is half of Flostradamus, and I&nbsp;think that’s where the name came from. So they were sort of leading the scene in Chicago at the time, and she started rapping because she was just casually MCing this bloghouse-ish party called Get Out of the Hood, and then she started making music officially. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did it lead to A‑Trak’s setting up the Fools Gold label?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">So Kid Sister made this song and then A‑Trak starts shopping it around, trying to get in on a&nbsp;label, because he was like <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>this is bigger than just a&nbsp;random blog track,” but he said that none of the labels understood it, including <em>Vice</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s label, who had put out Justice and other weirdo shit… So this was sort of why Fools Gold was created [in 2005], to put out shit like this, and then of course A‑Trak was Kanye’s touring DJ.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So that’s where Kanye’s connection to the era comes in?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Yes. A‑Trak was his touring DJ at this time, so suddenly, bloghouse is one degree away from Kanye, who was already so big at the time, because it’s post-<em>College Dropout</em> but pre-<em>Graduation</em>. And so, one could argue, [it could have been] A‑Trak putting Ye onto Daft Punk, which leads to <em>Stronger </em>on <em>Graduation</em>, him getting in with the Ed Banger people and SoMe the graphic designer who did the visuals on the <em>Good Life</em> video…. <br></p><p dir="ltr">I think Kanye is extremely tuned into culture and has always been deeply online, despite how famous he’s been, you can just tell that he’s in the trenches. Maybe now it’s different, but I&nbsp;don’t think someone was doing the research for him and giving him a&nbsp;file, breaking it down, I&nbsp;feel like he did it himself. And this kind of goes to show – he gave this track a&nbsp;remix with a&nbsp;verse and it ended up being a&nbsp;big song. Kid Sister never had another big song after that, because I&nbsp;think the Kanye co-sign made the industry think she was gonna be a&nbsp;mainstream big rapper and they didn’t really know what to do with her. Which is unfortunate, because it’s not her fault.<br></p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

It went to Number 2&nbsp;in the UK Singles Chart and was also nominated for two Grammys in 2010.</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">It absolutely was a&nbsp;massive song here too. It peaked at Number 3&nbsp;on the US Billboard 100. It starts off as kind of a&nbsp;moody rap song from Kid Cudi, who was ahead of his time and doesn’t really fit in with the rap landscape. But, ultimately, what catapulted the song – and this is in true bloghouse fashion – is a&nbsp;remix from a&nbsp;kind of random group. Crookers is now a&nbsp;solo act, but at the time it was a&nbsp;duo. They’re from a&nbsp;small town in Italy. Very blogable artist, but smaller than Justice, smaller than Simian Mobile Disco. But they do a&nbsp;remix of this song, and it absolutely blows it out of the water and gets it to chart.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So how did the track come into being?<br></strong><br>I spoke with Phra, who’s the current solo member of Crookers, and he says he found<em> Day <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Night</em> on Myspace – which is the most bloghouse shit in the world – while he was hanging out at his house in Italy. He messages Kid Cudi asking if he can remix it and Kid Cudi is like <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>yo, talk to my label”, the label is Fools Gold, and then Fools Good is like <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>yeah sure — here are the stems”. Something funny that Phra told me in the book is that he never mastered the song. It was just so bootleg. And he told me that he thinks the version that got so big was the unmastered version and just nobody really cared, which was so reminiscent of the priorities of the era.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1184490"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Boys Noize – <em>Oh!</em> (A-Trak remix) (2008)</h3></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="1184491"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/LK3jGjiaLho' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1184492"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">The original of this came came out in 2007, A‑Trak remixed it in 2008, and then he re-released it in his <em>In The Loop: A&nbsp;Decade of Remixes</em> album in 2016. This also has a&nbsp;harder sound. It’s got that more banger‑y sound.<br></p><p dir="ltr">A‑Trak really was ushering in this sound to a&nbsp;US audience. I&nbsp;know he’s Canadian, but his label Fools Gold was based out of New York. So it’s like, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>OK, you get this A‑Trak remix treatment and suddenly you’re just in the canon.” And so I&nbsp;think the fact that they collaborated in this way really solidifies Boys Noize as being part of bloghouse, even if [he wasn’t trying to be].<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>There was definitely an aspect of silliness to a&nbsp;lot of bloghouse.

Something I&nbsp;write about in the book is that bloghouse came out of electroclash – i.e not self-serious dance music – whereas dance music has traditionally been very serious in that way. I&nbsp;think Boys Noize on the spectrum was maybe a&nbsp;bit more serious, without being douchey. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1184493"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Bloody Beetroots – <em>Warp 1.9</em> ft.

Now, that’s not a&nbsp;huge amount of money, but that influx of cash changed his life. It was exactly the amount he needed to pay to get his song <em>Ugotme</em> on <a href="https://theface.com/music/albums-shouldnt-shuffle-spotify-adele-30-kanye-west-beyonce-taylor-swift-nirvana-the-stooges" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a><em>. </em>A&nbsp;hazy, lovelorn track that showcased his prowess with the guitar, it’s since been streamed more than 53 million times on the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">At 23-years-old, those 8‑figure streaming numbers are just the beginning for Apollo. His influences reach far and wide, firmly rooted in R&amp;B, but branching out into the realms of funk, hip-hop and even Mexican corrido, a&nbsp;nod to his Mexican-American heritage. This is all evidenced on last year’s <em>Apolonio</em>, his <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>quarantine project” (AKA mixtape) that he recorded in the confines of his bedroom as Covid wreaked havoc on the world.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Delicately sombre, with lyrics that sound as though they’ve been ripped straight from his heart, it’s a&nbsp;track that continues to explore Apollo’s favourite theme: unrequited love.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>To me, <em>Bad Life</em> represents putting in energy into a&nbsp;relationship and not getting anything in return,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It’s a&nbsp;song about being resentful towards somebody – wanting them to have <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>bad life’ with whoever they’re with now.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">How did Uchis get involved? <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I posted a&nbsp;snippet in January teasing it and Kali called me after telling me she loved it, so I&nbsp;asked her if she wanted to get on it.

Now I’m like, let me just get myself together. I’ll go to the gym, do my skincare routine and just mentally prepare myself. Maybe I’ll listen to a&nbsp;bunch of music, look at old lyrics and notes, go through them and try to find some inspiration.

But these aren’t your regular youngsters in pursuit of a&nbsp;good party. Cappo (Elliot Edusah), Two Tonne (Jordan Peters) and Kidda (Reda Elazouar) also run their own pirate radio station, and their broadcasts of bootleg finds have earned a&nbsp;rep good enough to play in clubs. And as impending adulthood threatens to pull the trio apart, it’s absolutely essential that they get into the club to have a&nbsp;night they’ll never forget. With a&nbsp;mega soundtrack featuring <a href="https://theface.com/music/conducta-interview-kiwi-rekords-volume-4-issue-005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UKG</a> greats Ms Dynamite, DJ Luck &amp;&nbsp;MC Neat, Sunship and more, you’ll leave the cinema with a&nbsp;big ol’ grin on your face and a&nbsp;craving for a&nbsp;proper good rave.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Out in UK cinemas now</em><br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--styling-section " data-block="1186313"><div class="styling-section styling-section--decontain styling-section--paddingOnTopAndBottom styling-section--noMargin"

Luckily, the universe has just dropped this new comedy-drama series into our laps. Written by the mind behind <em>Girls Trip</em>, Tracy Oliver, and produced by none other than Pharell Williams, <em>Harlem</em> plunges us into the lives of four besties living in (you guessed it) Harlem, New York, where they’re struggling their way through relationships, careers, yada yada… Sure, it’s a&nbsp;familiar format, but with Oliver behind the pen, it’s sure to make you laugh regardless. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><em>Available on Amazon Prime now</em><br></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--styling-section " data-block="1186323"><div class="styling-section styling-section--decontain styling-section--paddingOnTopAndBottom styling-section--noMargin"

Basically, this criminal mastermind guy called The Professor rounds up a&nbsp;bunch of other people who are good at doing illegal shit and guides them to pull off two high-stakes heists. The first one went pretty well (bar a&nbsp;few casualties), but the second one is proving to be a&nbsp;bit of a&nbsp;pickle.

How are you handling it?<br></strong>Well, I&nbsp;was in the corner shop buying toilet roll and bin bags and there was a&nbsp;group of school kids who cornered me and stood in different aisles. I’m waiting for an eligible bachelor to recognise me on the street, but it hasn’t happened yet. </p><p><strong>You’ve been on more than four dozen <em>Chicken Shop Dates</em> in seven years. Why are you still single? <br></strong>Well, then I’d have to retire the show! Also, I’m extremely picky and haven’t met the one that has the whole package.</p><p><strong>What are you looking for? <br></strong>They have to know my name – sometimes that hasn’t been the case. They also need to be funny. Actually, no, they need to laugh at my jokes, that’s more important. And they need to like chicken nuggets.</p><p><strong>How’s Drake doing?<br></strong>He’s doing fine, I&nbsp;think. From what I&nbsp;can tell, he’s still rich and famous, and obviously obsessed with me. I&nbsp;ended up meeting him at Wireless Festival. It was unreal. </p><p><strong>Did you cry?<br></strong>I cried when I&nbsp;was on the phone to my mum telling her what happened. I&nbsp;left immediately after because I&nbsp;was overwhelmed. <br> It was a&nbsp;fleeting moment, but we hugged for what felt like forever. It was like he wasn’t real, like a&nbsp;hologram. </p><p><strong>Are you sure it wasn’t a&nbsp;hologram, Amelia?<br></strong>I’d like to clarify he was not a&nbsp;hologram.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="1173846"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZSA8EACpMDY' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1173847"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p><strong>What did he smell like?<br></strong>The first thing I&nbsp;said to him was: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>You smell amazing.” I&nbsp;don’t know what it was, probably like an Oud thing.

                    Sure, Pete Davidson and Kim K look like they're having a great time. But will they be together for a long time? Different story, mate. THE FACE's sex and relationships pro, Charlotte Bayes, breaks down exactly why you should be wary of rebound relationships.

And over the past few years, Davidson has become synonymous with fun, short-lived flings, having worked his charm on some of Hollywood’s hottest women, like <a href="https://theface.com/music/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-performance-gaming-vr-mac-miller-travis-scott-lil-nas-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ariana Grande</a> and Margaret Qualley. He’s the king of celebrity dating. She’s the queen of celebrity culture. Sure, the match is surprising, but you have to admit that it kind of makes sense.<br></p><p dir="ltr">But while I&nbsp;hope that Kim <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Pete’s new relationship is fun and fulfilling for both, to me, this screams rebound relationship. As a (former) queen of rebound relationships, I&nbsp;find myself wanting to run to them – and anyone else who’s stuck in the cycle – screaming, making them aware of potential red flags ahead. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0265407514525086">A study from 2014</a> tells us that a&nbsp;rebound relationship – that is, any relationship started within three months of the end of a&nbsp;significant past relationship – typically lasts between four months and a&nbsp;year. <br></p><p dir="ltr">So how do we end up in rebound relationships? </p><p dir="ltr">Well, when leaving behind a<em> dry-dead-tired</em> relationship, finding someone completely fucking different to your ex is incredibly enticing. All the things that annoyed the hell out of you about your ex? This shiny, brand new shiny person does the exact opposite! <br></p><p dir="ltr">For example: the Kanye West we often see is a&nbsp;deadly-serious, hyper-focused, super-driven guy. Without knowing him it’s hard to guess how fun loving he is in private, but in public we rarely see him crack a&nbsp;smile. I&nbsp;mean, this is the man who wrote <em>No More Parties in LA</em> while married to the world’s biggest socialite influencer. </p><p dir="ltr">Pete Davidson, on the other hand, is famous for being about as unserious as you can get, a&nbsp;chaotic <em>SNL</em> comedy king who loves to par-<em>tay</em>.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Above anything else, the reason we choose a&nbsp;partner is compatibility. That includes things like attraction, sex and, most importantly, things you have in common. </p><p dir="ltr">This might be a&nbsp;bit of a&nbsp;misnomer: a&nbsp;relationship isn’t perfect only because you both love ambient house, dogs, baking sourdough and hiking. Opposites attract and all that. <br></p><p dir="ltr">But in a&nbsp;rebound relationship, once you stop fucking each others brains out and you can’t actually think of any activities you both enjoy doing or talking about together, you are left with two people with not very much in common at all. </p><p dir="ltr">Over time, having absolutely nothing in common with your partner will very quickly break down the relationship. At one point in our relationship – after the sex had died down, we had got married, had moved across the country and even opened up our relationship to spice things up – listening to and talking about Radio 1&nbsp;was legitimately all my ex-husband and I&nbsp;had in common. <br></p><p dir="ltr">You can also end up rebounding with the same people over and over again. I, for instance, didn’t seriously date a&nbsp;man who wasn’t an edgelord IT nerd, musician or both until my early 30s. </p><p dir="ltr">It’s pretty easy to see why we seek comfort in jumping from one relationship to another that’s very similar. Once you’ve forged intimacy and closeness with someone, it’s very hard to readjust to sudden loneliness. It is far easier to make a&nbsp;new bond with a&nbsp;person who is, consciously or unconsciously, familiar to you and your sensibilities. At this stage of processing your break up, it’s important to remember exactly why those previous relationships with edgelord IT nerds and musicians didn’t work.</p><p dir="ltr">That should bring you back down to reality pretty fast.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="1182159"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Giving yourself the space to think, you help find someone and something as great as Barack <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Michelle or Bey <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Jay”</p></blockquote><div class="pullquote__citation"><p>CHARLOTTE BAYES</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182131"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">If you end up in a&nbsp;rebound relationship, that usually means you haven’t taken the time to grieve and move on from your previous relationship. Which probably also means that you haven’t worked out what you do and, most importantly, don’t want in a&nbsp;new partner. </p><p dir="ltr">It’s a&nbsp;cliché, but taking some time out between relationships is important for lots of reasons. If we move on too soon, we often bring old habits and hang ups with us into new relationships and create repeating patterns. This can then get you stuck in a&nbsp;cycle of relationships that just don’t work out… over and over again. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Being single is a&nbsp;great time to put yourself first. If we don’t create enough space for ourselves to work out exactly what we want for our lives, careers, goals and achievements, you won’t know what you want to get out of a&nbsp;new relationship. Hook-ups, however, are great and thoroughly endorsed. <br></p><p dir="ltr">It might hurt for a&nbsp;bit, but giving yourself the space to think will ultimately mean that, instead of boomeranging around from relationship to relationship, you will find someone and something as great as Barack <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Michelle, Bey <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Jay, or even J‑Lo <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>n’ Ben Affleck. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Do I&nbsp;see Kim and Pete working out? Well, with Pete’s dating history and knowing what we know about rebounds, I&nbsp;predict the relationship will last as long as a&nbsp;Kardashian spon con.

I&nbsp;struggle with sound regulations these days,” the club music figurehead says, sipping coffee in one of The Tanks’ dressing rooms on the morning of the event. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Dance music is a&nbsp;physical form of celebration, you need to be moved by the music before you even move yourself.” </p><p dir="ltr">Ready for his photoshoot, the British-Canadian DJ, producer and tech enthusiast is dressed head-to-toe in Prada. He comes across as a&nbsp;seasoned professional who is gracious, composed and thoughtful as we chat about his work with the Italian fashion house.</p><p dir="ltr">Richie Hawtin and Raf Simons’ friendship began when they met at a&nbsp;festival in Ghent, Belgium, around 10&nbsp;years ago, but their official work together with Prada began in 2020. Having long associated the aesthetics of Prada with his output as Plastikman, it’s a&nbsp;serendipitous pairing that has felt natural from the start, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>like pieces of a&nbsp;different puzzle coming together,” as Hawtin puts it. As he gets older, Hawtin feels more aware of the finite time he has on this planet and the value of spending time with people he shares ideals with. In his work with Prada, he gets the nourishment of sitting around the table and chatting with people who understand him.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">The first Prada Extends event hosted sets from Hawtin, Overmono, HAAi and OK Williams. The line-up was assembled to embody the sound of London and each DJ was paired with an artist for the visuals: Joelle Snaith, Rebel Overlay, Hanzo and L’Aubaine, respectively. In the brutalist architecture of The Tanks, the night unfolded into a&nbsp;sort of Berghain for fashionistas, looks and cocktails served in equal measure. As the weighty bassline of Overmono’s euphoric track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRVxRUJxITY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>So U&nbsp;Kno</em></a> rattled through the concrete room, I&nbsp;too wondered about the art upstairs.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m very happy with the first Prada Extends evening,” Hawtin told me after the event. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>The unique four-way set-up created an energy between [the artists] and the audience, and led to a&nbsp;really infectious night. It was a&nbsp;pure melting pot of fashion, culture and music.”<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

So, how did this time impact you creatively and how did you keep busy? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">When you think about the last two years, of what it gave you or what it took from you, we felt it in different ways. We all had hard moments, trying to figure out what was happening with the world, our lives, our jobs and everything. But I&nbsp;was already coming into 2020 knowing that it was a&nbsp;transitional year. In February [2020] I&nbsp;was with the photographer Willy Vanderperre. We did a&nbsp;photoshoot and the whole theme was transition. I&nbsp;was turning 50 and had 30 incredible years of DJing and touring under my belt.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">And so, when Covid-19 came, I&nbsp;tried to keep that in my mind, to take it as a&nbsp;transition, something I&nbsp;knew I&nbsp;was going into, maybe not exactly as I&nbsp;expected. All I&nbsp;knew was that I&nbsp;had been missing studio time and missing music making. When I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;kid, when I&nbsp;was introverted and didn’t feel comfortable in my own skin, the studio was where I&nbsp;really felt comfortable. So it made complete sense that the studio needed to be the place to sit this situation out. </p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">At first, I&nbsp;rekindled my love and fascination with all the machines around me, a&nbsp;reintroduction to many old friends from the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>90s. I&nbsp;used the first couple of months to remember how and why I&nbsp;was fascinated by electronic music. Then I&nbsp;started to be inquisitive about where I&nbsp;wanted to go: what type of machines? What type of sounds? In the summer, I&nbsp;had started on some new material when I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;call from Raf [Simons] asking if I&nbsp;would be interested in soundtracking Prada’s first digital fashion show. It was exactly what I&nbsp;needed, to go from research and development mode in the studio to something which was really concrete and had a&nbsp;set of parameters to frame my energy and my focus.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="1182833"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Richie-Hawtin-The-Face-03.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1854" height="2771" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Richie-Hawtin-The-Face-01.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2040" height="3050" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182834"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>How have you found DJing again now that clubs are back open?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">It feels like everyone is jumping back into exactly what they were doing before. I&nbsp;love DJing and touring and travelling. It’s great to have that inspiration back and it’s great to have that part of the economics of my life back. But I’ve been very careful about how many shows I&nbsp;book. The world is so crazy and overconsuming. We saw so much beauty came back during Covid-19 with nature and wildlife, and there’s so much talk about the environment, rightly so. I&nbsp;think, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>man, are people really not sensitive to what’s happening on the planet?”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">I think what I&nbsp;love about music, and why I&nbsp;love design, aesthetics and fashion like Prada, is that there’s a&nbsp;beautiful sensitivity that we’re all in touch with in our individual art forms. That sensitivity is something I’m very interested in creatively, but also socially and ecologically. So I&nbsp;find it incredibly exciting going back into the real world, but it’s also challenging and confusing sometimes.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">I don’t want to lose this real love and connection to music making and the other side of my creative brain. DJing is absolutely great, it is a&nbsp;beautifully creative experience for me. But it’s everything that surrounds that. After 30&nbsp;years, I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;touring machine, I&nbsp;can handle it, but you only have so much time. I&nbsp;want to be fully creative and present in the studio, present with my family. I’m trying to find the balance to give my most impactful, intense DJ experiences. And if that means I&nbsp;do less than I&nbsp;used to, but I’m firing on all cylinders, then that’s amazing.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you see the intersection of fashion and electronic music, and why do you think it works so well?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">I think it has been there for as long as there’s been both of those art forms. Sometimes it works well, sometimes it’s not real or authentic and it crumbles. I&nbsp;think that’s what people from electronic music are afraid of, especially the more original techno underground [scene], who may argue that fashion and music shouldn’t come together. </p><p dir="ltr">But think about David Bowie. Think about his ideals and personality, and how his music became something more when he fused fashion and his musicality together. Think about Kraftwerk. If you strip away the image of the robots, the music is still incredible. But it’s what you take from the image of Kraftwerk and how it gives the music even more of a&nbsp;futuristic edge. I&nbsp;was brought up on Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream and Mute Records, who [all] had a&nbsp;real visual sense. Also, going into record stores and choosing records because the cover looks cool. It doesn’t always mean it is going to be cool, but when it looks as good as it sounds, or vice versa, it’s just so much more powerful. I’ve always remembered that in all my musical endeavours.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">In my early career, it was about the look and feel of the records with Plus 8. And in the late <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>90s, with the Plastikman <em>Consumed</em> album, I&nbsp;felt there needed to be a&nbsp;look. I&nbsp;stand for a&nbsp;certain style: minimalistic, reduced, hypnotic. For me, there’s a&nbsp;look to that sound. When I&nbsp;was first looking for fashion I&nbsp;felt comfortable in, something that felt like an outward expression of what I&nbsp;was feeling inside the studio, I&nbsp;gravitated to Prada. I&nbsp;didn’t know anything about fashion, it just fit.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">When Raf, who was already a&nbsp;big Plastikman fan, called me, it was a&nbsp;completely new endeavour, but enough parts of the equation already felt close to me that it felt like the right direction.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="1182835"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m looking for electronic musicians and visualists who have a&nbsp;shared aesthetic, of sensitivity to details, to silhouettes, to quality, to beauty – all the things that I&nbsp;believe are innate to the Prada brand.”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182836"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is it about your music and yourself as an artist that makes Prada a&nbsp;good fit?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">I think the sensitivity of my music, [the fact] that it’s very stripped down. The space within the music allows it to connect to a&nbsp;visual medium. But not just any visual medium, it’s very specific in my mind that my music works in connection with the visual and design aesthetics of Prada. It’s not this flash, logo-driven fashion brand – there’s something more subtle about it. You’re seeing beautiful silhouettes. Everything comes together, not just Miuccia [Prada] and Raf’s designs and my music, but also the way it’s filmed and the architecture of the spaces by Rem Koolhaas. There is this restraint that allows you to look deeper, listen deeper, or experience architecture in a&nbsp;deeper way. It doesn’t present everything to you at once. People [are] coming from different disciplines with that same intention, to fill different gaps and complement each other.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You’ve done four shows with Prada now, how has the process developed?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">They become more challenging every time. It takes an incredible amount of time and creative energy. It’s partly dangerous, because I&nbsp;feel that the Prada projects have drained me creatively over the last year. But when I&nbsp;look at what the pieces have become, it’s been worth it. It’s been exhilarating to go through all these processes, and be on this deadline to boil and reduce my ideas to their essence, and then to see them all come to fruition at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">Fashion is so much [about] the moment. You can plan and plan, but as they’re going into the shows and they’re doing their final looks, an idea comes and they react. I&nbsp;have to work with that as a&nbsp;musician and I’m able to do that as a&nbsp;producer because of my years as a&nbsp;DJ. That’s a&nbsp;reaction, it’s spontaneous. Being pushed and challenged is why I&nbsp;got into electronic music in the beginning. The music is never finished. There’s new tech, new machines, it’s still about the future. By design, it’s going to continue to challenge me as an artist and as a&nbsp;DJ, and I&nbsp;find that in this whole conversation I’m having with Prada.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What does the word <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>extends” mean to you in the context of Prada Extends?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">When we were brainstorming about doing more work together, I&nbsp;was thinking about what the relationship between Prada and myself has become. It’s an extension of your creativity, it’s extending my music beyond the techno fans, it’s connecting it to visuals, to different aesthetics, and it just goes beyond our normal connections. This project is about a&nbsp;crossroads of like-minded creatives. There was this idea of moving around the world doing different events and thinking about what we could offer local artists by having these conversations. Can we challenge and extend their creativity? Can we extend their audience? Can we cross disciplines and barriers and cultures? </p><p dir="ltr">There has to be a&nbsp;core value, something that brings us together. And I&nbsp;think that, being fascinated by electronic music, I&nbsp;am looking for electronic musicians and visual artists who have a&nbsp;shared aesthetic of sensitivity to details, to silhouettes, to quality, to beauty, all the things I&nbsp;believe are innate to the Prada brand and are part of what makes my music touch people. Those are the kinds of people we’re looking for. It’s an extension to welcome more creatives into the Prada family. <br></p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

You’ve got this central dance floor with four surrounding DJ booths, four DJs, four visual artists…</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It was important for me to have a&nbsp;way to present the artists in the most beautiful aesthetic way and for there to be a&nbsp;flow throughout the night. One of the things that I&nbsp;don’t like when you’re performing in clubs and festivals is the shuffle between artists. I&nbsp;wanted each artist to have a&nbsp;place where they could be focused and present their idea in an undisturbed way. Inspired by what Rem Koolhaas did with the other Prada shows I&nbsp;soundtracked, we’re capturing the silhouette of each performer. We’re capturing the visual presentation. It’s very much about space and architecture, all the things that I&nbsp;felt made these Prada and Plastikman collaborations successful.</p><p dir="ltr">There’s also something about being immersed in sound. And then, what is a&nbsp;dance floor? It brings people together. What is Prada Extends? It is Prada extending and bringing people together in conversation and celebration. In celebration of design and aesthetics, but also in celebration that we can come together again. By surrounding everybody in speakers, in these totems of visuals and artist stages, it is also very womb-like, very communal, very warm.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are your thoughts on conversations about dance music needing to be more inclusive and diverse? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">I remember getting into dance music when I&nbsp;was 15 or 16. The beauty of the dance floor was that it was filled with such diversity that it opened up my mind, it blew me away. I’d never seen or felt these frequencies, I’d never seen people with so much contrast in sexuality, colour, language. Somewhere along the line, as dance culture exploded, we lost that. It’s really important for me to remember where my journey started and to be active in bringing those ideals back. The way to do that is to get involved in projects where you’re with people who are open to those ideas, or are also thinking about them. Unfortunately, in dance culture, I&nbsp;don’t think it’s as common as it should be.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It comes back to what you were saying: that we’ve all gone back to doing what we were doing before. And now it’s whether people are going to make good on those conversations and act on what they were preaching last year.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The vibrancy of early dance culture was what made me excited. It’s also how I&nbsp;fit in. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;nerdy white kid, but when I&nbsp;got into it, the dance floor was not filled with nerdy white kids, it was filled with every colour and denomination of people, people who felt like they didn’t fit in somewhere else. I&nbsp;would love to support that, to give a&nbsp;safe place on the dance floor for anyone who feels a&nbsp;little bit left, or just feels like their ideas aren’t being heard, or their fashion is not understood, or their sexuality not appreciated. That’s the power of the dance floor. I&nbsp;think that by collaborating with fashion, you can magnify the intention there.</p><p dir="ltr">I’m doing some work in France with the artist John Gerrard, who is concerned with the environment, and what I’m really understanding, at this moment in history, is that we need to work together and collaborate as artists to magnify the issues that we all feel connected to. That ranges from inclusivity and diversity to the environment, to nurturing new talent but also supporting the original talent. There are so many different voices and we need to celebrate that and work together. This is also, for me, the power of dance culture. Originally, there was such a&nbsp;DIY, independent feel. Our little scene could do anything. I&nbsp;like to remember that. We have such an amazing opportunity to make dance music a&nbsp;leader in all these important values.</p><p dir="ltr">As you can tell, I&nbsp;want to find ways to tackle these big questions of our time. I&nbsp;think it can be overwhelming and can put you in a&nbsp;position where you are unsure [of] how to take a&nbsp;step forward. I’m becoming more and more aware that, to make a&nbsp;difference, it’s about collaborating and sharing ideas, talking and coming together. I’ve spent 30&nbsp;years in dance music culture, I&nbsp;would be very proud to see it continue to be an even more positive force in people’s lives.</p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>

Since it was launched 15&nbsp;years ago, <a href="mailto:@lukas_wigflex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lukas Wigflex</a> has been throwing the East Midlands city’s best parties, while also running a&nbsp;label and co-founding the arts and event space Fisher Gate Point.</p><p dir="ltr">Having released EP <em>Play Monotonous</em> by local artist <a href="mailto:@sonofphilip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Son of Philip</a> (real name Tom Smith) on the Wigflex imprint, the two mates teamed up for the recently-released <a href="https://trouble-maker.bandcamp.com/album/me-meds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Me &amp;&nbsp;Meds </em>EP</a>, a&nbsp;tripped-out three-tracker of chugging club music laced with surreal humour and punk grit.

I&nbsp;think it’s pretty similar for Charlie. I’ve had a&nbsp;studio with Lukas the past few years and we’ve wanted to get Charlie on something for ages. There’s so much crossover between us all it feels like it just makes sense.</p><p><strong>Tell us about the inspiration for the </strong><strong><em>Godstruth</em></strong><strong> video…</strong></p><p><strong>Charlie: </strong>Well there’s some pretty stand-out creative cues from other videos that we’re all fans of. The Streets’ <em>Original Pirate Material</em>, for example, or Baxter Dury’s <em>Slumlord </em>video. But the predominant influence and driving force for the project in general is our shared <em>Viz</em>-like, off-key sense of humour. It basically acted as a&nbsp;visual expression of in-jokes that we share about some of the incredible oddbody-bastards you see dotted about the pubs in the darker corners of Nottingham. </p><p><strong>If you could bring one closed-down venue back from the dead, which would it be? </strong></p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>The Bomb, all day long. I&nbsp;was lucky enough to have some of my first partying experiences in that place. It was a&nbsp;seminal little basement club with low ceilings and a&nbsp;good system. It was bang in the centre of Notts and it would have the world’s best DJs passing through every week. Craig [Richards] had a&nbsp;residency there before his Fabric days, which says it all.</p><p><strong>Charlie: </strong>Gotta be Blueprint for me. Absolute shit’ole! The seemingly infinite free party. Smack bang in the centre of Radford (which is a&nbsp;bit of a&nbsp;no-go zone to those that don’t know, or it was at the time) on the outskirts of Nottingham’s town centre. It’s my choice mainly for a&nbsp;gabber and breakcore night called Labotomy, which given the current hardcore and gabber resurgence, would boot off at the minute. Anyway, it was the only place we could get into before we were old enough to have ID. It was as bad as it sounds, an absolute free for all. It was the place I&nbsp;heard pretty much all styles of dance music that I&nbsp;love for the first time. You could do whatever you liked and everyone did. Real freedom!</p><p><strong>Which Nottingham up-and-comers should THE FACE’s readers check out?</strong></p><p><strong>Tom: </strong>Big Tobes X10.</p><p><strong>Lukas: </strong>There’s loads of great artists up here at the moment. I’m feeling Frost, Outsider, Scoobs and Running Circle Records at the moment.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--button " data-block="1182998"><div class="content-builder__block--m copy"><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="tf-onpage-button"><section><a href="https://theface.com/tag/the-face-mix">Listen to more Face Mixes</a></section></section></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--box-out " data-block="1182999"><div class="box-out__container"

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182936"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p><strong><strong><em>Taken from the new print issue of THE FACE. Get your copy <a href="https://magazine.theface.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</em></strong></strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Take one step into the undergrowth of the social timeline and you’ll find a&nbsp;festival of violence in the UK.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Men hurl punches in wild brawl on hard shoulder of M20… Moment mass brawl erupts inside Asda as hooded rival thugs smash each other with bottles of WINE in front of horrified shoppers… <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Close the clubs again!”: Shocking moment a&nbsp;mass brawl erupts between revellers in city centre during the first weekend of freedom… Pub brawler bites his rival’s EAR off and spits it onto the ground in savage beer garden fist fight… Man pulls knife on queue jumper at London petrol station as fuel crisis intensifies.</em></p><p dir="ltr">These random flashes of barbarism hail from every corner of this island and from (almost) all walks of life. This being 2021, there’s usually video: or indeed, a&nbsp;<em>Rashomon</em>-esque array of videos from different angles and perspectives, all revealing something new and ever more disturbing.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a&nbsp;supply and a&nbsp;demand for these clips. In recent years, a&nbsp;cottage industry of social media accounts dedicated to citizen-documented punch-ups and police chases has emerged; a&nbsp;budget British reboot of the old WorldStarHipHop videos (which became so notorious in American life that people started chanting <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>WorldStar! WorldStar!” whenever something kicked off).</p><p dir="ltr">Often, the footage is shared (and sometimes bought) by bigger media companies before being blasted into the normosphere for all to gawp and tut at. In the last few days I’ve seen videos of a&nbsp;racist road-rage incident at a&nbsp;McDonald’s car park in Kent, the aftermath of a&nbsp;tasering in Birmingham and a&nbsp;group of lads <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/punches-thrown-snooker-cue-snapped-21654205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking pool cues over each other’s heads</a> as <em>Things Can Only Get Better</em> hums from the flatscreen TVs in a&nbsp;Swansea bar.</p><p dir="ltr">The considered response to this phenomenon is that it’s the result of a&nbsp;cameraphone society and a&nbsp;social media culture. A&nbsp;contemporary incarnation of what the writer Tom Wolfe called <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1967/7/1/some-tentative-conclusions-about-porno-violence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>porno-violence”</a> in the late 1960s. Once upon a&nbsp;time, these fracases would have little oxygen beyond a&nbsp;story in the local gazette – now they’re thrown out in all their gory glory, the distorted yelps and crunches blaring out from inbuilt speakers like some particularly difficult Japanese noise album.</p><p dir="ltr">The comments and replies lurking beneath the videos certainly further the idea that these fights have become a&nbsp;kind of ultra-violent edition of <em>Match of the Day</em>; all crying-face emojis, tacky memes and cries to bring back National Service. Even from a&nbsp;position of moral outrage, the commenters reveal an instinct to escalate things, to fight fire with napalm. I&nbsp;couldn’t begin to count the amount of times when, below a&nbsp;story of some bloody teenage melee, someone replied: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Leave them in a&nbsp;room with a&nbsp;paratrooper regiment for an hour, that’ll knock some sense into them,” or made a&nbsp;feverish demand to turn the horses, dogs, tear gas and water cannons on those responsible.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

The hopelessly naive troupe of aging academics and green entrepreneurs were quickly dragged off the roads by furious white-van-men and stressed-out school-runners, with a&nbsp;chorus of online onlookers braying for them to be given a&nbsp;further kicking. Because if there’s one narrative that Britain loves above all others, it’s people who step out of line getting a&nbsp;beating for it.</p><p dir="ltr">While you can certainly look towards 24/​7 digital media as a&nbsp;root cause, it’s difficult to quell the idea that something bigger is brewing here – that there is a&nbsp;very real surge of rage and violence in the UK. There is an understandable conclusion that something in society is driving it, an uncertain agitation in the streets. A&nbsp;feeling that we are living through an age of great aggravation.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s hard to quantify this notion exactly. According to the statistics, violent crime has remained largely stable over the last few years. But what we’re talking about here isn’t necessarily <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>violent crime” (which is usually extreme, driven by desperation or criminality rather than rage). The petty nature of many of these incidents means they aren’t often recorded in convictions, arrests or even hospitalisations. Much of it is anecdotal, ephemeral. More of an intangible sensation than a&nbsp;measurable crimewave. At times, it can feel like you’re seeing something that isn’t there, or that you’re stuck in some highly subjective social media hellhole.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who study the nature of anger day in, day out certainly seem to believe something is afoot. Mike Fisher, from the <a href="https://www.angermanage.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">British Association of Anger Management</a>, sees a&nbsp;cause and an effect.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I think people have a&nbsp;lot of reasons to be angry,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>There’s an increase in stress, in mental health issues, an increase in addiction. And I&nbsp;think it has a&nbsp;lot to do with the era we live in.”</p><p dir="ltr">Fisher points me towards his organisation’s website traffic, which he says has doubled over the last five years. During lockdowns, visitor interest in the site, he said, has been <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>unprecedented”.</p><p>His assertions about the era in which we live certainly ring true. At times it feels like the universe is provoking us. The geopolitical movements of now appear to throw fuel on the home fires: the rapidly mutating rage that gathered during last year’s lockdowns; the explosion of cartoon violence at the Euros final at Wembley; the bizarre <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>storming” of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/aug/09/confused-anti-vaccine-protesters-storm-bbc-hq-years-after-moved-out" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrong BBC building by anti-vaxxers</a> in August; right up to the widely publicised fighting at petrol station forecourts during October’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>fuel crisis”. These world events have more often than not resulted in human furore – the macro manifesting in a&nbsp;micro of mild concussions and lacerated eyebrows.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="1182939"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Looking at the constant news of teenagers being murdered over obscure disputes and drug debts, the petrol station punch-ups seem rather insignificant indeed; the hobby of a&nbsp;bored, addled and broadly white, male class”</p></blockquote><div class="pullquote__citation"><p>CLIVE MARTIN</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182940"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Then there are the smaller, less politically inclined incidents that seem to touch on some greater nerve; the innumerable dashcam skirmishes on timelines, the risible <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Instagram pranksters” who <a href="https://www.indy100.com/news/spiderman-attacks-asda-workers-brawl-b1889577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacked a&nbsp;female Asda worker</a>, the Great British pursuit of men in three-piece suits lamping each other at horse races, the chaos that seems to occur regularly at Speaker’s Corner in Hyde Park.</p><p dir="ltr">Such events seem to react and exist within the times we live in: a&nbsp;natural byproduct of an adversarial age, accelerated by iPhones and egged on by a&nbsp;public with an appetite for broken bones. It’s something you can feel, experience, participate in. Even if you’re, say, a&nbsp;middle-class journalist.</p><p dir="ltr">It often feels like every time I&nbsp;step out of the house there’s trouble. I&nbsp;think about some of the incidents I’ve witnessed or been part of recently; a&nbsp;furious bald man headbutting a&nbsp;pub window, a&nbsp;weird stoner who tried to go for me in a&nbsp;coffee queue, two skateboarders I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;barney with in Dalston, a&nbsp;woman with a&nbsp;dog-ball launcher who screamed at me for stepping in front of her in the cheese aisle. In one particularly regrettable incident, I&nbsp;found myself yelling <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>people like you voted for the Nazis!” at a&nbsp;pair of boomers who had just reprimanded me for jogging too close to them.</p><p dir="ltr">In the mid-sized seaside town where I&nbsp;live, one of those viral video incidents occurred when a&nbsp;team of notorious local bouncers took it upon themselves to body slam a&nbsp;couple of teenage girls into the low-traffic, high-street paving. In this country, even the most sedate of locales seems to come with a&nbsp;sense of imminent brutality.</p><p dir="ltr">But it isn’t just the amateurs, the Sunday drivers of unchanneled rage, behind all this. There are also a&nbsp;wealth of professional bruisers and micro-mercenaries to contend with; a&nbsp;legion of uniformed, mandated goons that encompasses everyone from overzealous Covid marshalls to juiced-up doormen, the private security prospectors that run everything from <a href="https://www.g4s.com/en-gb/what-we-do/facilities-management/range-of-environments-and-clients">asylum-seeker detention centres to music festivals</a>, a&nbsp;booming bailiff industry and a&nbsp;seemingly invincible police force. With authority figures like that, what chance do we have?</p><p dir="ltr">What’s more, it would be short-sighted to pass this off as purely an issue of fat blokes and <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>roid boys scrapping in supermarket car parks. Some communities, some groups, have a&nbsp;far more serious level of violence to contend with. Looking at the constant news of teenagers being murdered over obscure disputes and drug debts, the petrol station punch-ups seem rather insignificant indeed; the hobby of a&nbsp;bored, addled and broadly white, male class.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182941"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Delve beyond the pedestrian fisticuffs and a&nbsp;far more disturbing portrait of British violence emerges. In deprived areas, amongst struggling communities, the stakes have become far, far higher. By mid-October this year, a&nbsp;staggering 26 teenagers had been stabbed to death on the streets of London – with a&nbsp;couple of shootings thrown into the mix. It’s a&nbsp;proportionally similar story in the West Midlands, Leeds, Manchester, but also in places you wouldn’t necessarily expect. Surrey, a&nbsp;county obligatorily described as <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>leafy” in any newspaper report, saw an astonishing 614 per cent rise in knife crime <a href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/surrey-news/no-boundaries-any-more-sharp-16735080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from 2009 to 2019</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-56365412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epidemic of violence against women</a> occurring. Last year, it was estimated that 1.6 million women were victims of domestic abuse, with 207 killed in the year leading up to March 2020 and so many more cases going unreported. High-profile murders like that of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa this year, and Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman in 2020, have exacerbated the pre-existing dread and fear that many women feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking at these distinct strands of violence, it’s clear to see that they are not the same thing. For many Black, Asian and minority ethnic young people, women and LGBTQ+ communities – who are often targeted, ignored or simply not believed – cameraphones can be tools of justice, as we saw in the case of George Floyd in 2020. While some can sit at home and enjoy the vicarious thrills of videoed violence, others do not have that privilege because it is their reality. </p><p dir="ltr">With so much grave, inescapable violence in our culture – just thinking about all the spilled-pint punch ups can feel rather trivial. Yet, there must be some kind of red thread going through a&nbsp;supposedly developed nation where all these different issues with violence and aggression coincide. Perhaps, by looking at how quickly and ferociously violence explodes in the most mundane of situations, we may get some insight into the graver ends of the spectrum. Because anywhere that turns the tiniest of grievances over parking spaces, queues, Facebook threads and funny looks at the bar into <em>Deadwood</em>-esque brawls must have something in the water.</p><p dir="ltr">If you wanted an example of how the mood of the nation has changed, take a&nbsp;look at the events of September 2000, when Britain went through <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/sep/23/autumn-2000-fuel-shortages-uk-standstill-price-protest-panic-buying" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a&nbsp;genuine, tangible fuel crisis</a>. When protesting lorry drivers set up blockades outside major refineries, there were serious shortages within days. More than 70 schools closed, the NHS went into emergency mode, there was panic-buying in supermarkets.<br></p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

People panicked, but they didn’t start brawling with each other for the dregs of the pumps. Which is a&nbsp;stark contrast to this year’s somewhat confused version, where tensions hit boiling point over little more than media rumours. In turn came a&nbsp;glut of violent viral incidents, some of which involved weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, cameraphones play their part here; certainly when it comes to documenting incidents, and possibly with the <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>put up or shut up” scenarios they engineer – physical prowess potentially immortalised in a&nbsp;Mail Online embed for eternity. Yet, no matter how much perspective you throw at it, that sense of an impalpable rage in people’s hearts refuses to shift.</p><p dir="ltr">So what’s happened? My own, lefty inclination is that this is what happens when you continue to grind people up against each other in an increasingly competitive society. That years of austerity rule and a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>fuck off” discourse are really starting to show. Having a&nbsp;Home Secretary that half-considered installing a&nbsp;wave machine in the channel to deter refugees can’t help either. Nor can a&nbsp;well ­documented, cross-societal issue with drink and drugs.</p><p dir="ltr">But part of me wonders if it runs deeper than that, if there’s something more intrinsic at play here. Something in the national make-up; that old cliche of the island nation, the one that colonised vast swathes of the planet with barrel and bayonet.</p><p dir="ltr">When the people with EU flags in their social bios yelled <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>Why can’t we just have a&nbsp;nice time?</em>” when, during the summer’s Euros, England fans rushed the ticket barriers, fought with police and each other, and desecrated Leicester Square with a&nbsp;carpet of broken glass and bloodied flags, they seemed to be ignoring something at the heart of British identity; the perpetual cycle of repression, rage, repression, rage, <em>explosion</em> within which so many of us are reared.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Britain is a&nbsp;culture of imploders that eventually explode,” says Fisher. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>So when we explode… we really explode. This adds more tension to family life, mental health issues and the mood of the culture.”</p><p>Criminologists have a&nbsp;term: <a href="https://sk.sagepub.com/reference/violence/n168.xml#:~:text=Expressive%20violence%20(also%20known%20as,that%20are%20transformed%20into%20anger." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>expressive violence”</a>. It’s one which takes on a&nbsp;whole new meaning when applied to the people of this country. There is a&nbsp;long-established stereotype that Brits are unable to express themselves properly, a&nbsp;trope that goes right back to the earliest days of cultural analysis.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1182944"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>We British, according to many outsiders, are reserved, repressed, resilient, unemotional and self-controlled,” said Thomas Wright, a&nbsp;kind of proto-Jordan Peterson, in 1604. I&nbsp;wonder if, perhaps, through arguing and fighting, a&nbsp;more usable language is created. Some maniac means of communication, or indeed, a&nbsp;crude expressive artform. Painting watercolours with the blood on the pavement.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the most telling aspect is how much many enjoy the spectacle of it. I&nbsp;certainly do. Rubbernecking at some ridiculous pavement scrap, we don’t exactly cheer people on. Rather, indulge it as a&nbsp;kind of Great British pastime. An endearingly grim part of our heritage, like Scotch eggs or Artex ceilings. Whether this is a&nbsp;kind of natural gallows humour or a&nbsp;sick coping mechanism, I’m not quite sure.</p><p dir="ltr">At times, it can seem like efforts to understand have made things worse. As discussions about mental health, addiction and trauma become more prevalent in popular media, things have only slid further into the berserk. What worries me most is that, rather than learning, we’re creating a&nbsp;breed of self-aware sadists, recalling <em>The Sopranos </em>psychiatrist Dr Elliot Kupferberg’s assertions about psychopaths <a href="https://www.presstelegram.com/2007/06/05/soprano-therapy-plot-spurs-outrage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sharpening their skills through therapy</a>. The popularity of podcasts like <em>Anything Goes With James English</em>, where <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>reformed” villains veer between bawling their eyes out and boasting about cracking people over the head with shotgun butts, certainly suggests this to me.</p><p dir="ltr">The sense I&nbsp;get is that Britain’s chickens are coming home to roost. That our culture has upped the ante in recent years, turning people against each other in evermore lurid and unpredictable ways. A&nbsp;long-standing national motto of <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>What the fuck are you looking at?</em>” is colliding with an age of hyper-documentation, creating a&nbsp;new kind of bloodsport to fill the vacuum left by public executions and full-contact British Bulldog.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes I&nbsp;wonder if the best course of action is to find a&nbsp;safe spot in the crowd, to just stand back and enjoy it. But not everybody has the freedom, or the inclination, to do that.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="1182945"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

This would be little more than 48&nbsp;hours after the news broke of his passing.</p><p dir="ltr">Little wonder that the atmosphere on the ground in Miami this week has been deeply sombre – Abloh spent much time working on projects in the city, particularly during Art Basel.</p><p dir="ltr">But the mood on Tuesday night was one of immense celebration. The show itself – the French fashion house’s first in the United States since it was founded in 1854 – took place, on a&nbsp;typically balmy Florida night, at the Miami Marine Stadium, a&nbsp;remote, disused venue on the city waterfront. </p><p dir="ltr">Guests including <a href="https://theface.com/search?query=kanye+west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a>, <a href="https://theface.com/culture/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-kris-jenner-reality-tv-hayu-season-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Kardashian</a>, <a href="https://theface.com/life/the-big-mood-rihanna-bag-for-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rihanna</a>, <a href="https://theface.com/music/asap-rocky-debut-mixtape-love-ten-year-streaming-services-review-spaceghostpurrp-clams-casino-yams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A$AP Rocky</a>, <a href="https://theface.com/search?query=kerwin+frost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kerwin Frost</a>, <a href="https://theface.com/search?query=Pharrell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pharrell</a> – and many, many more of Abloh’s close friends – were transported to the show space from the mainland via boat. There they were met by a&nbsp;serene catwalk covered in trees and a&nbsp;gigantic, glowing, red hot-air balloon emblazoned with the house’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>LV” monogram.</p><p dir="ltr">The collection itself – in part a&nbsp;reiteration of the looks shown in Paris in June – featured a&nbsp;number of Abloh’s LV classics in a&nbsp;cacophony of colours. Think: tonal leather trench coats, monogrammed parkas, gradient-hued jackets, fur jackets in audacious neons and voluminous tulle skirts, many of which were grounded with a&nbsp;pair of Louis Vuitton X&nbsp;Nike Air Force 1s. </p><p dir="ltr">The tribute closed with a&nbsp;particularly moving voice-note from the man himself and played atop sombre strings: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Life is so short that you can’t even waste a&nbsp;day subscribing to what someone <em>thinks</em> you can do, versus what you <em>can</em> do.”<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Meanwhile, the themes of flight and transcendence were inescapable, from the show invitation contained origami-inspired instructions to create a&nbsp;paper plane, through to the drone-powered light up paper planes that illuminated the night sky like shooting stars.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, one runway show finale doesn’t cement Virgil Abloh’s magnificent and immeasurable legacy. Such were his myriad achievements in a&nbsp;multi-disciplinary career and a&nbsp;life richly lived, it didn’t need to do anything so grand. </p><p dir="ltr">But the designer’s Art Basel Miami Beach final bow was a&nbsp;memorable, powerful and unabashedly – not to mention wholly appropriately – sentimental tribute to a&nbsp;once-in-a-generation creative pioneer who will remain in our hearts and minds forever. </p><p dir="ltr">Virgil was here.

Here, he extends his own subtly psychedelic and dub-inflected sound for a&nbsp;solid-as-a-rock, 4am kinda set.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1181643"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h4 class="content-builder__heading">Fictions #46 with Gigsta – <em>In The Forest</em> (Autumn Aroma Edition)</h4></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1181644"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p><em>Seasonal foraging with a&nbsp;radio adventurer</em></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="1181645"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1165858090&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/gigstab" title="Gigsta" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Gigsta</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/gigstab/fictions-in-the-forest-with-gigsta-20211026" title="Fictions #46 w/ Gigsta 26.10.2021 - In The Forest (Autumn Aroma Edition)" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Fictions #46 w/ Gigsta 26.10.2021 - In The Forest (Autumn Aroma Edition)</a></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1181646"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>With her commitment to <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>slow gigging” and her radical approach to radio – eclectic, thematic and meticulously prepared – Gigsta’s practice presents an enticing alternative to the commercialised spectacle that dance music has largely become.

Crypto​.com offers a&nbsp;few different cards. In this sense they seem more like a&nbsp;credit card, but they aren’t. The top-tier card offers you eight per cent cashback on purchases, free Spotify, free Netflix, free Amazon Prime, 10 per cent back on Expedia, private airport lounge access and Crypto​.com Private (exclusive to <a href="https://crypto.com/cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top-end card-holders</a>), which you can use to read about recent crypto developments and get advice on your crypto. </p><p dir="ltr">The catch? You need to have about £300,000 <a href="https://theface.com/life/what-is-staking-crypto-bitcoin-cryptocurrency-ethereum-altcoins-tokens-digital-finance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staked</a> into CRO. </p><p dir="ltr">There is a&nbsp;free option, which will give you one per cent cashback, which is still more than most debit cards. But there’s also the hassle of topping the card up with crypto each time, and not being able to reverse the transaction unless you withdraw it all from an ATM – once it’s on the card, you have to spend it. </p><p dir="ltr">Other retailers are available, but <a href="https://theface.com/life/cryptocurrency-scam-how-to-spot-guide-bitcoin-dogecoin-memecoin-altcoin-ethereum-money-finance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scams</a> exist in this area, as with the rest of crypto, so it’s good to be with a&nbsp;company you trust. Nobody wants to set up a&nbsp;debit card only to realise you’ve actually just sent an anonymous person money. <br></p><p dir="ltr">If you’re trading, crypto debit cards can become useful. Say you have £100 worth of a&nbsp;cryptocoin, and the next day it’s at £110, that’s a&nbsp;free tenner you can spend. If you wake up and the £100 has been reduced to £90, you can see that as a&nbsp;good time to top-up the card, but it’d make the meal deal 10 per cent more expensive compared to yesterday. <br></p><p dir="ltr">You also don’t need a&nbsp;bank account for these, you can just sell some of the currency on your app, which makes it accessible to many people. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--button " data-block="1177813"><div class="content-builder__block--m copy"><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="tf-onpage-button"><section><a href="https://theface.com/life/cryptocurrency-scam-how-to-spot-guide-bitcoin-dogecoin-memecoin-altcoin-ethereum-money-finance">Read more: how to spot a crypto scam</a></section></section></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1177814"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">Why are crypto people buzzing about CRO?</h5></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1177815"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Along with the multiple features and services it provides, part of the value boom is due to Crypto.com’s announcement of a&nbsp;20-year contract for the naming rights of Los Angeles’ Staples Center, the sports stadium which is home to the LA Lakers, LA Sparks, LA Clippers and LA Kings. It’s costing the crypto firm around <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/cryptocom-buys-naming-rights-to-lakers-staples-center-in-a-700-million-deal-.html">$700 million</a>, while the attendant marketing campaign cost about a&nbsp;billion dollars. It also has a $100 million partnership with Formula 1&nbsp;and a&nbsp;sponsorship with the National Hockey League’s Montreal Canadiens. </p><p dir="ltr">It appears to be a&nbsp;real power move, as these deals will link the brand with some of the biggest franchises in sport. While those in the know will be more aware of Crypto​.com as a&nbsp;business doing many things, the masses are at least going to see the word <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Crypto​.com” in huge letters on their team’s (or opponent’s) stadium and beyond. </p><p dir="ltr">This will make it a&nbsp;port of call for people looking to eventually get into using crypto in some form. If a&nbsp;crypto coin visibly exists and works with a&nbsp;big business, there’s usually a&nbsp;big increase in value. </p><p dir="ltr">Holiday tip: the official name change of the Staples Center happens on Christmas Day, so it’ll be interesting to check the value while having the post-Christmas dinner power nap. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1177816"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">Is the value of CRO likely to go up?</h5></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1177817"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>According to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/price/crypto-com-coin">Coinbase​.com</a>, the coin went down by five per cent in the last 24&nbsp;hours (at the time of writing). But in the last week it sits at up 29 per cent, and across the last month, up 307 per cent. On the whole, that’s all pretty good. The coin has also risen to becoming the 14<sup class="ordinal">th</sup> most popular crypto out there, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coin​mar​ket​cap​.com</a>. So people are visualising a&nbsp;rainfall of crypto dollar bills and the demise of government-controlled currencies as we know it.</p><p>It’s hard to say if the value is likely to go up and up and up. But the coin clearly has a&nbsp;lot of uses and is making a&nbsp;point of being a&nbsp;mainstream sponsor across sports, so more people will hear about it, which could lead to an increase in value. But: there could be a&nbsp;glitch in their system, the government could try and crack down on taxes (because people can very easily avoid them with crypo) or Elon Musk could tweet something – who knows! </p><p>In short, anything is possible when it comes to emerging cryptocurrencies. But, again, we can’t give financial advice, so always err on the side of caution when it comes to investing your money. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1177818"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">So there’s a&nbsp;little primer on CRO and Crypto​.com – a&nbsp;token native to a&nbsp;<a href="https://theface.com/tag/blockchain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain</a> and a&nbsp;company that are basically doing a&nbsp;whole load of things within the crypto universe.

It’s a&nbsp;sporting phenomenon that has, in the past couple of years, soared from niche hobby to bona fide mainstream trend.</p><p>This year alone, one million of us Brits have taken part, racking up 19,000 monthly online searches on the <a href="https://theface.com/tag/sport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sport</a>, with the UK now home to more than 400 climbing walls. Climbing even made its <a href="https://theface.com/tag/olympics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Olympic</a> debut in <a href="https://theface.com/society/olympic-hopefuls-tokyo-2020-sport-jeanette-kwakye-alice-dearing-kyra-edwards-women-team-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo</a> this summer.</p><p>Stats aside, you need only look to Instagram for proof.

Even the way young people are dressing points to a&nbsp;pursuit of the outdoors inside. <a href="https://theface.com/tag/palace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Palace</a> cargos lined with great big pockets, Salomon shoes built for trekking, Gore-Tex zip-ups, Uniqlo fleeces and relaxed, stone-coloured T‑shirts are all finding their way into a&nbsp;pub near you.

I&nbsp;went rock climbing and I&nbsp;enjoyed it so much. This is my new thing.<strong><br><br>What do you love most about it?</strong><br>I feel like the person I&nbsp;am is very stereotypically <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>feminine”. Being able to do something that is stereotypically <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>masculine” has grown my confidence in the sense that you don’t have to portray what you are on the outside.

                <![CDATA[
                    The latest TV drama from Russell T. Davies is an Eighties-set exploration of queer boys on the cusp of the rest of their lives – and of the AIDS crisis. It’s bold, vibrant and groundbreaking. We go on set, meet the creator and his cast, and ask: why did it take so long?

Russell T. Davies’ brilliant drama was set in the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>80s and followed a&nbsp;group of queer boys hitting London and hitting adulthood – little knowing that a&nbsp;new disease was about to change their lives, and that of a&nbsp;generation.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the series’ launch on Channel 4, writer Douglas Greenwood went onset and talked to crew and cast, including lead actor Olly Alexander, singer with Years &amp;&nbsp;Years. His story for THE FACE, like Davies’ hit show, reported on the devastation wrought by HIV in the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>80s and beyond.</p><p dir="ltr">But along with <em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s blockbuster ratings – it was All 4’s biggest ever instantly-available boxset, and the streaming platform’s most binged show to date – came other record-breaking figures. Its broadcast was timed to National HIV Testing Week (1<sup class="ordinal">st</sup> – 7<sup class="ordinal">th</sup> February) and, according to HIV and sexual health charity Terrence Higgins Trust, contributed to a&nbsp;more-than-doubling of the number of HIV tests ordered compared to the same week the previous year.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the Trust’s helpline saw a&nbsp;30 per cent increase in calls the day after the first episode aired. As Ian Green, Chief Executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, said at the time: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em> has had an amazing impact… The series examines a&nbsp;time in our history we must never forget – when people were dying of a&nbsp;mystery illness and we didn’t know why. </p><p dir="ltr">He continued: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>But it’s also important that everyone knows how much HIV has changed since then thanks to massive improvements in preventing, testing for and treating HIV. You can now live a&nbsp;long, healthy life with HIV and effective treatment means you won’t pass on the virus to anyone else. We’ve seen the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span><em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em> effect’ on National HIV Testing Week with tests being ordered at a&nbsp;faster rate than ever before off the back of the series. That’s a&nbsp;brilliant legacy for the series.”</p><p dir="ltr">Today, let’s remember those wins, but also the lives lost.

The revellers have left. Spilt drinks have been cleaned up, boombox silenced, kisses swapped with strangers who are already a&nbsp;dot in the distance. </p><p dir="ltr">The party, clearly, is over, which is something the guests are going to have become used to.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s January 2020, a&nbsp;few months before the world goes into a&nbsp;viral tailspin. Dramatist Russell T. Davies, creator of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xK9fkf7N33g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Queer as Folk</em></a> and rebooter of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jULdonuql0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>, is inside the hulking building, rebuilding queer history once again. He’s on the final stretch of filming <em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em>. It’s a&nbsp;five-part, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>80s-set Channel 4&nbsp;series that follows five friends living in London as the AIDS epidemic starts to creep quietly and devastatingly through the city, disrupting, at first, their fun, and then their lives. </p><p dir="ltr">Though the show is predominantly set in the capital, almost all of it has been shot here on what for Davies is familiar turf – he shot <em>Queer As Folk </em>in the city in 1998, and 2019’s hit BBC/​HBO drama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SY41jhIP_xI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Years and Years</em></a>. Manchester’s neoclassical architecture stands in for Westminster; its cobbled streets replicate the site of anti-Tory policy protests; the former classrooms of Eccles’ Old Wentworth High have been meticulously transformed into interior sets, including AIDS hospital wards. </p><p dir="ltr">Within the school’s high-ceilinged former assembly hall, the friends’ four-bed South London abode, known as the <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Pink Palace”, has been built from scratch. Its flaking, beige wallpaper – typical of London’s dingy rental digs, then and now – is masked with theatre posters and campy decor such as plastic lobsters on the wall. It looks and smells lived in, the floorboards flecked with the sweat and pretend booze of the dozens of extras who had earlier piled into it. <br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

The show’s central character Ritchie Tozer, played by Years &amp;&nbsp;Years frontman Olly Alexander, unveils his drag persona, Rachel, to hoots and hollers. Queer boys snog and shag and suck each other off in bedrooms. Extras mill about in era-appropriate lurid patterned shirts, pleather and string vests. But across the kitchen table, there are whispers of a&nbsp;strange gay plague that’s starting to spread through America, quickly finding its way into Britain, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em> is set between the years of 1981 and 1991, the decade in which AIDS mutated from a&nbsp;murmured rumour into Britain’s biggest killer of men aged between 25 and 44. The ages of the characters correspond with that of Davies, now 57, at that time. But the Welshman insists this is not an autobiographical story. Instead, it’s one told very loosely through the lens of a&nbsp;close friend of his who lived in the real Pink Palace. A&nbsp;place he visited, and whose occupants he once knew.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>There was nothing like those years,” the scriptwriter reflects in his warm Welsh gruff, leaning against the kitchen sink in the post-party flat. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It wasn’t just about death. These were lives that were lived.”</p><p dir="ltr">Davies – who has spent most of his career flitting between queer storytelling and the sci-fi that most recently found form in <em>Years and Years</em> – is one of the few people capable of doing justice to a&nbsp;show about Britain’s AIDS crisis. But time had to pass – almost four decades – in order for him to reach a&nbsp;headspace that would allow him to confront it. It was, for a&nbsp;while, too sore. AIDS was the deadly trauma that leeched his generation of its freedom, happiness and hope.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>When it came to<em> Queer as Folk</em>, I&nbsp;was absolutely determined that HIV would not be centre stage,” he tells me, speaking from his Swansea home that looks out into the Bay, a&nbsp;year after my set visit. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I wrote that show in 1998. We had been through 18&nbsp;years where I&nbsp;felt like we were always being defined by that disease, so I&nbsp;was determined to break us free from it.”</p><p dir="ltr"><em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em>, then, is the moment things change.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I feel like I’m righting a&nbsp;wrong, in a&nbsp;sense. I’d have gone to my deathbed very sad if I&nbsp;hadn’t written this.”<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="703626"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ltoWiLj_aIk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="703627"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">The scenario that inspired the show’s creation has been in Davies’s head for decades: a&nbsp;family arrives at a&nbsp;hospital to find their boy dying, learning of his sexuality and imminent mortality in one fell swoop. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>That’s a&nbsp;true story many times over,” he says soberly. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It’s been burning in my mind for 30&nbsp;years.”</p><p dir="ltr">Those spectres come to life again on screen here, haunting characters full of the same energy boys like Davies and his generation once possessed. Ritchie, Alexander’s character, is 18 when we meet him. A&nbsp;wide-eyed Isle of Wight queer, he has his heart set on a&nbsp;London life more extravagant than the law degree his parents forced him into. He soon sacks it off, studying English and Drama instead, and finds freedom in all of the boys his new city has to offer.</p><p dir="ltr">As an actor (a career he admits <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>falling into”) you often forget Alexander – a&nbsp;very young-looking 30-year-old – has worked with everybody from Gaspar Noé (in 2009’s <em>Enter The Void</em>) to Greta Gerwig (in 2011’s <em>The Dish and the Spoon)</em>. But the Yorkshireman had largely retired from the screen after Years &amp;&nbsp;Years’ career took off in 2015. That year the synthpop band won the BBC’s Sound Of… poll, had a&nbsp;Number One single with <em>King</em> and also topped the charts with debut album <em>Communion</em>. But four years on, having finished touring his group’s second record, 2018’s <em>Palo Santo</em>, he arrived back in London to continue work on its follow-up.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>It felt like it wasn’t really clicking,” he says of the new music written in that weird limbo period. Then the script for <em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em> came along. It was a&nbsp;story he felt passionate about, made by a&nbsp;man whose defiantly queer work he had watched since he was a&nbsp;closeted 14-year-old, hand on the remote in a&nbsp;schoolfriend’s bedroom.</p><p dir="ltr">As it turned out, the offer to play Ritchie was, he says, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>serendipitous” in more ways than one. This is a&nbsp;drama which foregrounds the celebratory pop of the era, everything from Laura Branigan’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ17LTYOrto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gloria</em></a> to Bronski Beat’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88sARuFu-tc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Smalltown Boy</em></a> – and, of course, the Pet Shop Boys’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRHetRTOD1Q&amp;list=LLyrtDcw2tCivxOBlABjIrMQ&amp;index=2186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1987 epic</a> that gives the show its title. After completing filming, Alexander scrapped almost the entire record and started again. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>A combination of doing the show and that period of dancefloor and disco [inspired me]… I&nbsp;realised how much that was a&nbsp;source of strength and courage.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">In the show, Ritchie is joined by a&nbsp;handful of lads whose stories weave intricately, importantly, around his own. Roscoe, played by the effervescent rising star Omari Douglas, is a&nbsp;queer boy from the city who escapes his family’s Christian faith to live his true life in the Pink Palace. Wildly talented Welsh newcomer Callum Scott Howells plays Collin: a&nbsp;slightly gawky, perpetually suited Savile Row apprentice who feels like the group’s innocent baby brother. Then there’s Ash, a&nbsp;regular bed buddy of Ritchie’s whom actor Nathaniel Curtis, making his professional debut, describes as <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>calm, kind, but also very emotionally guarded”. He’s the wise, clear-headed one of this found family. </p><p dir="ltr">Though Ritchie is framed as the central character, it’s Jill, a&nbsp;caring soul and matriarch to these effectively motherless boys, who acts as the glue at the show’s reflective core. Played by Lydia West (<em>Years and Years</em>, <em>Dracula</em>), she’s both hardy and hugely sensitive, the ravaged life of her friends – and her own – effectively mirrored in the glassy, hazel glimmer of her eyes. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>There’s tragedy,” West says of Davies’s script. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>But as a&nbsp;character you’re not playing the tragedy – you’re just living it. And when you have Russell’s beautiful writing, you can just say the word and half your job is done.” </p><p dir="ltr">Remembering their work together on <em>Years and Years</em>, Davies calls her <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>amaaazing</em>”, that second syllable stretched like bubblegum, multiple times, when we talk. She reminds him of Sophia Loren.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="703628"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/4230-Boys-0165.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2000" height="1333" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="703629"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Since the epidemic shaped the output of queer artists in the late 20<sup class="ordinal">th</sup> century, the stage and screen has tackled the AIDS crisis in a&nbsp;myriad of manners. <em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin,</em> in that sense, may seem like nothing new. After all, aside from the obvious (Jonathan Demme’s 1993 Oscar-bait weepy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cl4B9AU45P4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Philadelphia</em></a>) we’ve had <em>Angels in America</em>, playwright Tony Kushner’s 1991, Pulitzer Prize-winning theatrical epic of New York’s AIDS addled years, which transferred from Broadway to HBO screen and was later staged by London’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ACZsdNFuP0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Theatre in a&nbsp;2017 production</a> starring Andrew Garfield and Russell Tovey.</p><p dir="ltr">Larry Kramer’s <em>The Normal Heart </em>experienced a&nbsp;similar afterlife, ascending from off-Broadway hit to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZxR9XHS0H8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2014 Ryan Murphy TV movie</a>. Then there are the lesser seen arthouse films that capture the political fury fuelled by the disease and its spread: masterful 2017 French film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4_79dnJeNU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>120 BPM</em></a>, which explored the work of ACT UP in Paris, and agonising documentaries like 1993’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjGVT4BUG-w&amp;has_verified=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</em></a>, in which you watch a&nbsp;man succumb to AIDS complications through the camera lens of his dying husband.</p><p dir="ltr">They each tell stories of how an unpredicted and incurable virus swept through populations of gay men, sex workers and drug addicts – an onslaught Davies refers to as <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>a massacre” – claiming the lives of many of those it infected and shaping the ones of those who watched on.</p><p dir="ltr">But there are significantly fewer stories told about how it hit Britain (1987&nbsp;TV series <em>Intimate Contact</em> is a&nbsp;rare example), which makes<em> It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em> something of a&nbsp;rarity. Nonetheless, the show was a&nbsp;hard sell when its creator was pitching it to broadcasters, and Davies knows why. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>There was a&nbsp;feeling that it had been done.”</p><p dir="ltr">That’s hardly true, but Britain’s long standing love affair with the soap opera convinced TV commissioners that it had anyway.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>They are working class- and issue-based in a&nbsp;way that doesn’t exist in American television,” says Davies of <em>Coronation Street</em>, <em>Emmerdale</em> et al. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>EastEnders</em> played a&nbsp;game with Colin in the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>80s, and whether he had HIV or not,” he notes of Albert Square’s first gay male character. In the end, Colin was spared the stereotypical storyline. Instead, it was the character of Mark Fowler, a&nbsp;straight, married man, who became the avatar for AIDS in the show, eventually dying in 2004. <br></p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

They all were in Britain’s education system at a&nbsp;time when Section 28 was in place. The 1988 Thatcher government-instigated ruling banned the <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>promotion” of homosexuality in schools and was only repealed in England and Wales in 2003 (Scotland repealed it in 2000). </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Under [her] Britain, you were living in a&nbsp;time where people didn’t want to talk about sex or gay people,” remembers Douglas. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Put the two together, with this disease, and the [results] are just unbelievable.” </p><p dir="ltr">This rewriting of reality came at a&nbsp;time when its documentation was more necessary than ever. This was a&nbsp;violent, coercive attack against the sexual health and dignity of queer youth who, as a&nbsp;result of Tory rule, risked their lives through sexual experimentation, many inevitably dying as a&nbsp;result. Eighteen years on from its final abolition, Section 28’s effects linger.

Davies contemplated making a&nbsp;series that gnawed rigorously at that history, at the reactionary moments that forced the disease to spread through Britain. He had the scenes: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0SPrCTwsY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Princess Diana holding the hand of an AIDS patient</a> (“I’m very sad I&nbsp;didn’t get to dramatise that”); Health Secretary Norman Fowler begging support-sceptic Thatcher to air the infamous 1987 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iroty5zwOVw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Die of Ignorance</a> advert that Davies’ own characters watch in the show; <a href="https://www.tht.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terrence Higgins’s tide-shifting death</a> in 1982. </p><p dir="ltr">In the end, the didactic nature of mapping timeframes and fact-checking – something he found tricky while writing his Emmy-nominated script for 2018’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggDTJc470Co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>A&nbsp;Very English Scandal</em></a>, based on the 1970s Jeremy Thorpe political scandal – reminded him of why he loved his usual way of doing things. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>My only job as a&nbsp;dramatist is to make you love these people,” he insists. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>That’s my overriding drive when it comes to HIV and AIDS. I&nbsp;could talk to you forever about the medicine and the politics, but in the end it’s about the people. I&nbsp;want you to love them, so you miss them.”<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="703634"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Through this story [I was] able to engage so intimately with something I’d felt very afraid of in the past. It’s changed the way I&nbsp;feel about myself”</p></blockquote><div class="pullquote__citation"><p>Olly Alexander</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="703635"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">That love courses through <em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em>. It’s a&nbsp;story that feels wholly reliant on each character propping up their friends, and being there for each other, as if the whole illusion would cease to exist if one of them wasn’t present in the beginning.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>It’s been one of the most formative and profound experiences of my life, for so many reasons,” reflects Olly Alexander. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Through this story – and through meeting Russell and the others, people who went through this decade – [I was] able to engage so intimately with something I’d felt very afraid of in the past. It’s changed the way I&nbsp;feel about myself.”</p><p dir="ltr">The young acting family gathered at the heart of it all speak highly of Davies: of his mentorship, his writing, that ability to channel the emotions of people he lost into something celebratory, sexy and sad all at the same time. As Alexander puts it: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>We had a&nbsp;hero we all believed in.”</p><p dir="ltr">It’s worth noting that, for all the colour and care-free euphoria that helps make the show such a&nbsp;treat, the tale of <em>It’s A&nbsp;Sin</em> is historical in setting alone. While deaths from AIDS-related complications continue to drop, they still happen: in 2017 (the last year for which figures are available) 428 people died in the UK due to late diagnosis.</p><p dir="ltr">But the virus is no longer a&nbsp;death sentence. Early intervention means antiretroviral drugs allow HIV-positive people to live normal lives, and can suppress their viral load to the point of the infection being undetectable and unable to be passed on. Preventative medication like PrEP, now freely available on the NHS, reduces the risk of catching the virus by 99 per cent.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time, though, Alexander stresses these aren’t free passes for ignoring our own sexual health. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>PrEP is amazing,” he notes, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>but it can’t let us be lax about looking after ourselves and each other.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">As we’re talking, I&nbsp;wonder if Davies envies the queer generation who may, one day soon, have the freedom to live a&nbsp;blissful life denied his generation. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Oh God, no!” he exclaims, letting out a&nbsp;deep-throated laugh. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>We’ve thrown a&nbsp;lot of shit at them! They’ve got to handle an 80-seat majority Conservative government. It’s worse than it ever was!</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Obviously I’m not a&nbsp;fan of Margaret Thatcher,” he adds pointedly, something a&nbsp;deliciously conniving scene in the show’s fourth episode confirms, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>but in the light of our current Prime Minister, she looks like a&nbsp;fine upstanding citizen who spoke with honesty and dignity!” </p><p dir="ltr">Clearly, the comedy Russell T. Davies streaks through the bleakness of his drama, and vice versa, bleeds into his real life language, too. Then, thoughtful to the last, one of our great contemporary dramatists of real lives, fully lived, backtracks. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I do know what you mean, though. It’s a&nbsp;hard one with illness, because it’s not our job to look backwards. It’s in our nature, that human survival instinct, to keep moving on. Of course now, we have PrEP and antiretrovirals. But wherever there is boys and sex, there will always be trouble too!”</p><p dir="ltr">It’s A&nbsp;Sin<em> is on Channel 4&nbsp;from 22<sup class="ordinal">nd</sup> January</em><br></p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>

Are they even safe?</p><p dir="ltr">According to Mary-Anne Hunter, founder and technical director of <a href="https://www.prettypermanentmakeup.co.uk/AboutPrettyPermanentMake-up.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pretty Permanent Makeup</a>, semi-permanent makeup is a&nbsp;cosmetic semi-permanent tattoo that <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>stimulates natural features, such as eyebrows and freckles or traditional makeup (like lip liner and liquid eyeliner) is expertly applied and lasts up to five years.” </p><p dir="ltr">While semi-permanent makeup is nothing new, the techniques and trends used by modern practitioners are. In Hunter’s experience, the ideal candidate for faux-freckles is likely someone who is <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>already applying freckles with a&nbsp;pencil at home or someone who has freckles and wants to enhance them.” She also notes that she has seen a&nbsp;recent spike in demand. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I have been applying freckles for over 10&nbsp;years, but over the last five years, there’s been a&nbsp;boom.” That boom, she says, is down to Meghan Markle’s freckles and the publicity surrounding her during the Royal Wedding. </p><p dir="ltr">Renée Cleovoulou, director of <a href="https://thedermatographyclinic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dermatography Clinic</a>, who specialises in semi-permanent freckles, is a&nbsp;huge fan of the procedure, but says that those who are interested in it should always have a&nbsp;face-to-face consultation first. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>This is where we discuss the treatment, look at pictures and then I&nbsp;am able to give well-informed advice, as well as give clients an allergy test.” If the patient is suitable, freckles are then applied in two sessions. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>In the first session, I&nbsp;will mark where we want them and work conservatively as we can always add more later,” she says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>This also gives the client space to see how it works and get used to how it looks and feels on them.” </p><p dir="ltr">Then, the client is invited for a&nbsp;second session, during which the treatment will be reviewed, and she will add more freckles or make any amendments. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>In brief, there is no pain, perhaps a&nbsp;minor scratch for some and nothing to stay home for. You just need to keep the treated area clean, dry and out of direct sunlight for 14&nbsp;days.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">Semi-permanent freckles flake for between two to 10&nbsp;days. Initially, they will be very light and will slowly become more apparent in around two to three weeks. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>In four weeks, we are able to review and sometimes add more if we want to,” Cleovoulou adds.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--button " data-block="1174986"><div class="content-builder__block--m copy"><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="tf-onpage-button"><section><a href="https://theface.com/beauty/how-to-winterise-skincare-routine-dry-skin-hydration-product-expert-tips-advice">How to hydrate dry skin in the winter</a></section></section></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1174987"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Why are faux freckles so popular now? </p><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Beauty marks are quite popular for both guys and girls for many reasons, but notably because freckles draw the eye to a&nbsp;specific area and, when strategically placed, can enhance our favourite features, like the eyes,” says Cleovoulou. </p><p>Hunter agrees and adds that she has seen a&nbsp;notable shift. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Years ago, people wanted to get rid of their freckles. But for many years now, they have embraced their freckles and see them as symbols of youthfulness,” she says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>They help some achieve a&nbsp;safe sun-kissed look, as well as a&nbsp;touch of enhanced individuality.”</p><p>Semi-permanent faux freckles don’t come cheap. Each treatment usually costs around £300, including the review session afterwards. It’s also important to note that treatments like <a href="https://theface.com/life/generation-beauty-nails-aesthetics-botox-skincare-coronavirus-lockdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microblading</a> can look a&nbsp;little heavy for the first week. Any treated areas will also need to be kept dry until healed, while your technician should provide an after-care soothing balm to aid the healing process. <br></p><p>If you’re looking to achieve the faux freckles look but are not quite ready for the semi-permanent treatment, there are a&nbsp;plethora of alternatives to achieve the much sought-after look.

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1176916"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">In an Instagram post paying tribute to Virgil Abloh, Ghanian rapper Jay Bahd <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW1lg6lsgJo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described</a> the late visionary as his mentor, crediting Abloh for changing his life and helping <a href="https://theface.com/tag/asakaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asakaa</a> – a&nbsp;distinctive version of drill from the city of Kumasi – gain global popularity. </p><p dir="ltr">Anyone who has closely followed the asakaa movement will have spotted the cosigns from Abloh, who was, himself, the son of Ghanian immigrants. Whether it was gifting Jay Bahd Off-White sneakers and apparel, FaceTiming artists in the scene, promoting the sound on his own Televised_​_​_​Radio platform or simply liking their Instagram posts, Abloh made it clear that his love for asakaa was genuine. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>He made us KINGS amongst men,” reads a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW1ftPmsmpr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post</a> about Abloh from the asakaa collective Living Life Records. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>We love you! Forever in our hearts!! We gon’ make you proud!!!”</p><p dir="ltr">This is just one of the many examples in recent years of musicians feeling flattered, encouraged and inspired by Virgil Abloh’s support. Despite appearing to be one the busiest people in the creative industries, Abloh always seemed to find time for the artists who caught his ear, from underground acts to the world’s biggest superstars. </p><p dir="ltr">To understand how Abloh gained so much influence in contemporary music, it’s important to at least know the basic backstory of his creative relationship with Kanye West. </p><p dir="ltr">Virgil was first recruited by Ye’s team in 2007. The pair then interned together in Rome for Fendi in 2009, also working on Ye’s seminal album <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy </em>the same year<em>.</em><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Here’s this guy always in the studio,” Pusha T&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gq.com/story/virgil-abloh-cover-story-spring-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> of his memories of Abloh at those <em>MBDTF </em>sessions, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>and he’s pulling every reference under the sun from his computer – architecture, fashion. His laptop was like a&nbsp;library of everything that was aesthetically beautiful and relevant.”</p><p dir="ltr">In 2010, it was announced that Ye had made Virgil Abloh the director of his somewhat mysterious creative agency Donda. Abloh is credited as the art director on a&nbsp;hot streak of early-2010s releases with striking aesthetics – namely <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, </em>Ye and Jay‑Z’s collaborative album <em>Watch The Throne</em> and the 2012 GOOD Music compilation <em>Cruel Summer</em>. <br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

After helping a&nbsp;young A$AP Rocky and his underage friends into a&nbsp;Been Trill party at The Standard hotel in New York City, Abloh went on to design the merch for Rocky’s first tour, also creatively directing his 2012 debut studio album <em>Long. Live. A$AP</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">After <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, Kanye began work on his radically experimental 2013 album <em>Yeezus.</em> From 2008, Virgil Abloh would make an effort to show face at Benji’s much-loved <a href="https://theface.com/tag/deviation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deviation</a> club night whenever he was in London. Abloh helped bring Benji B&nbsp;on board as a&nbsp;key music consultant. The wide-ranging influences on<em> Yeezus</em> and contributions from leftfield producers such as Arca, Evian Christ and Hudson Mohawke are largely rooted in this creative relationship.<br></p><p dir="ltr">In 2018, Abloh was announced as the artistic director of Louis Vuitton Men’s. On the runway in Paris, which was inspired by Pink Floyd’s<em> Dark Side of the Moon </em>and the Yellow Brick Road, Abloh seemed to pledge his commitment to supporting Black musicians in his new position. At the end of the show, Abloh and Ye shared a&nbsp;tearful hug, while Playboi Carti, Kid Cudi, Dev Hynes and Steve Lacy were among those who walked as models. </p><p dir="ltr">Abloh recruited Benji B&nbsp;as musical director at LVM straight away. With a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>live only” policy, the shows have been scored in collaboration with artists such as Detroit techno legends Cyboyton, Ms Lauryn Hill, Yasiin Bey and London jazz musicians like Nubya Garcia, Shabaka Hutchings, Theon Cross and Yussef Dayes. In coordination with Vuitton’s SS22 presentation, Abloh creatively directed the short film <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=321241886206621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Amen Break</em></a>, while Benji gathered the likes of <a href="https://theface.com/tag/wu-tang-clan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wu-Tang</a> wordsmith GZA, Unknown T&nbsp;and Goldie together to contribute to the music.</p><p dir="ltr">An invite from Virgil Abloh to Paris Fashion Week could help boost the career trajectory of an artist, hence why he’s been referenced in the lyrics of UK rappers like Digdat and Headie One, for whom Abloh <a href="https://crackmagazine.net/2021/05/virgil-abloh-designed-headie-ones-2021-brit-awards-set/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">designed</a> a&nbsp;stage set and one-off tracksuit for this year’s BRIT Awards. Griselda’s Westside Gunn was so inspired by a&nbsp;trip to Paris with Abloh that he basically <a href="https://theface.com/music/westside-gunn-pray-for-paris-review-griselda-virgil-abloh-tyler-the-creator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made an album about it</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">Although Abloh’s artwork for Pop Smoke’s posthumous album <em>Shoot for the Stars, Aim for The Moon</em> was eventually scrapped following online criticism of its merit, Abloh had bonded with the late Brooklyn star in Paris, where they’d filmed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoHaaOpOjqo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music video</a> as part of the new Off-White™ International Rap Video Production Studio project.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="1176919"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8WIWtr2Rv4' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1176920"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Inexplicably, in recent years, Abloh even managed to commit to an increasing number of DJ gigs, securing coveted slots such as Movement festival in Detroit, Circoloco at Ibiza club DC-10 and Manchester’s Warehouse Project. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I don’t know what possessed me to take on the task to do a&nbsp;DJ set, as if I&nbsp;don’t have anything else to do,” he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8WIWtr2Rv4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">joked</a> ahead of his 2019 Coachella appearance.</p><p dir="ltr">Born in Rockford, Illinois and coming of age in Chicago during the <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>90s, Abloh was inspired by the house music scene, revealing to DJ and journalist <a href="https://theface.com/tag/ash-lauryn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ash Lauryn</a> in a&nbsp;<em>Resident Advisor</em> podcast that he worked the door at parties run by Ron Trent and Sonia H. In the club music world, Virgil developed friendships with artists like Peggy Gou, Honey Dijon and The Blessed Madonna, and recently hung out behind the booth with AceMo, MoMa Ready and Kush Jones – a&nbsp;group of young, energetic NYC DJs and producers who celebrate house, techno, jungle and footwork as Black genres. </p><p dir="ltr">Back in September, Abloh shared a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CT0SC2qJ8mg/?utm_medium=copy_link" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clip</a> of an intimate, dimly-lit party he’d hosted after the Met Gala, featuring the jam from the jazz band Badbadnotgood and impromptu freestyles by Kid Cudi and A$AP Nast. There was something typically pleasing and fun about the free-spiritedness of the footage, and the way Abloh so effortlessly made musical worlds collide. </p><p dir="ltr">Virgil Abloh used his positions to bridge gaps between luxury fashion runways, street anthems and sweaty dancefloors. His curation completely ignored any ideas about <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>high” and <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>low” culture, which are so often built on prejudices about race and class. One lesson we can learn from his time on this planet is that there should be no other approach. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="1177484"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

It’s the youth drama that ate all other youth dramas: a&nbsp;tough and uncompromising – but also thoughtful and insightful – exploration of relationships, sex, body consciousness, <a href="https://theface.com/tag/lgbtq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gender identity</a>, teenage hedonism and the claustrophobia of smalltown living, and all the variations therein. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1176051"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">Remind us of the key people and places, please.</h5></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1176052"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>Running the show is writer/​director Sam Levinson, who adapted the American version from an Israeli series of the same name. Set in the fictitious Southern Californian suburb of East Highland, the initial eight-episode series revolved around a&nbsp;bunch of teenagers getting high and getting by. And sometimes very much not getting by, as mentally and emotionally troubled lead character Rue (<a href="https://theface.com/tag/zendaya" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zendaya</a>) spiralled into the depths of addiction and her new-in-town best friend, Jules (Hunter Schafer), became entangled in an abusively complex love triangle.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1176053"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">Then what happened?</h5></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1176054"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>Rue and Jules fell in love with each other (it’s complicated), and we all fell in love with <em>Euphoria</em>. The show made stars of much of the cast: we celebrated it with two separate covers of our Winter 2019 print edition: <a href="https://theface.com/culture/javon-walton-actor-euphoria-hbo-boxing-onward-atheletics-volume-4-issue-002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Javon Walton</a>, who plays pre-teen drug dealer Ashtray, and <a href="https://theface.com/culture/alexa-demie-actor-euphoria-waves-volume-4-issue-002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexa Demie</a> (Maddy) who we first met having revenge sex in in a&nbsp;swimming pool. Also step forward Storm Reid (as Rue’s little sister, Gia), <a href="https://theface.com/tag/barbie-ferreira" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Barbie Ferreira</a> (Kat), Maude Apatow (Lexi) and Sydney Sweeney (Cassie). And it made a&nbsp;superstar of Zendaya. She went on to scoop the 2020 Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a&nbsp;Drama Series – at 24, the youngest ever actress to win the accolade.</p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

From British audiences enthusiastically embracing the lush pianos and signature log drums of <a href="https://theface.com/tag/amapiano" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amapiano</a> to west African pop music hitting the Billboard Hot 100 charts on three occasions (via Wizkid’s Tems-featuring <em>Essence</em>, CKay’s breezy <em>Love Nwantiti</em>, and <a href="https://theface.com/tag/amaarae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amaarae</a><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s Kali Uchis-featuring remix of <em>Sad Gurlz Luv Money</em>) the metrics for the growth of music across the continent have been visibly positive. </p><p dir="ltr">Another sign of the good times is a&nbsp;growing cultural bond between musicians from South Africa and their Nigerian counterparts. Historically, influences have moved fluidly between both parties, setting the template for cross-continental domination. Songs like Davido’s Mafikizolo-featuring <em>Tchelete</em> and DJ Maphorisa’s 2015 Wizkid and Dj Buckz-featuring <em>Soweto Baby </em>are classic examples of this creative synergy. </p><p dir="ltr">The rise of amapiano over the last 18 months has helped soothe cultural tensions after the trauma that followed the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-49726041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 xenophobic attacks</a> against Nigerians in South Africa stymied relations. Last year, Wizkid and Burna Boy made a&nbsp;scene-stealing appearance on <em>Sponono</em> off Kabza De Small’s landmark album, <em>I&nbsp;Am The King Of Amapiano: Sweet &amp;&nbsp;Dust</em> and the lush pianos of the Gauteng-pioneered genre are now a&nbsp;fixture of pop songs in Nigeria. </p><p dir="ltr">This month’s column is led, therefore, by a&nbsp;collaboration between Nigerian singer Davido and South Africa rapper, Focalistic. There’s also write-ups on a&nbsp;sweeping project from the Ghanaian auteur, M.anifest and, finally, a&nbsp;party-starting bop from Ms. Banks and Naira Marley.<br><br><strong>Listen to THE FACE’s Best new African music playlist on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ot9dT2bHdO2SVr8gFgw8Y?si=e8f78a2fca9b415d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a></strong><strong>.</strong><br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

On his latest project, <em>Mininu Di Oru</em>, the singer returns to the classic Cape Verdean melodies that he fiddled with on his debut album, <em>Semper TC</em>, while collaborating with a&nbsp;selection of singers from Cape Verde, Portugal and Brazil. The celebratory feel of the project is best captured on <em>No Bad Vibez</em>, a&nbsp;duet with Irina Barros where they move fluidly between English and Portuguese, declaring their intention to live a&nbsp;life free of negativity.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--single-ticker " data-block="1176193"><div class="content-builder__block--ticker"><ul class="ticker ticker--article"><li class="ticker__horizontal ticker__horizontal--sans" id="ticker-1176194"><div         title="Read more"

For the Best Global Music award, Wiz would be going up against Ghanaian afro-roots singer Rocky Dawuni’s <em>Voice Of Bunbon, Vol. 1</em>, Beninese legend Angélique Kidjo’s <em>Mother Nature</em> as well as Femi Kuti and Made Kuti’s father-son effort, <em>Legacy+</em>.

A&nbsp;new generation of musicians, inspired by the hip-hop and R&amp;B music of America, came onto the scene but few boasted the magnetism of the Plantashun Boiz. A&nbsp;boy band consisting of Blackface, 2Face and Faze, they captured the heart of Nigerians with their local interpretation of R&amp;B and dancehall melodies, successfully releasing their debut album, <em>Body &amp;&nbsp;Soul</em>, in 2000. </p><p dir="ltr">Following 2003’s<em> Sold Out</em>, 2Face decided to leave the Plantashun Boiz to pursue a&nbsp;solo career, leading to a&nbsp;rift with members of his band that led to accusations of betrayal and song theft. Their differences were further exacerbated when 2Face released his classic single, <em>African Queen</em> (which Blackface claimed to have written when they were still members of the Plantashun Boiz), instantly launching him to national superstardom. The lyrics to <em>African Queen</em> were clean and simple enough for parents to allow their children and wards to belt it out, ensuring that it maintained a&nbsp;ubiquitous across the country. As the acclaim for the song rose within Nigeria, it started to spread across other countries in the continent, becoming a&nbsp;hit single in many parts of west and southern Africa. In 2006, <em>African Queen</em> got an international release and was used in the American romantic comedy, <em>Phat Girlz</em>, becoming the first widely recognised first crossover hit from the modern iteration of Nigerian pop.</p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>

He decided to endure it privately: challenging, given his immense presence across <a href="https://theface.com/tag/fashion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fashion</a>, art, music and culture. Yet, despite Abloh’s influence as the artistic director of <a href="https://theface.com/tag/louis-vuitton" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis Vuitton</a> menswear, founder of <a href="https://theface.com/tag/off-white" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Off-White</a>, plus his position as one of the key designers of the Internet generation, the news only became public in a<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CW1FDd4oXan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> statement posted yesterday</a>, announcing the designer’s death at the age of 41.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">Today, we celebrate a&nbsp;designer of brilliantly unconventional merit. Illinois-born Abloh started his career as a&nbsp;civil engineer graduate in 2002 and it wasn’t until his studies at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2006, where he received his Master of Architecture, that he first became interested in fashion. At the time, the clothes he cared about were rooted in subcultures, favouring brands such as Alien Workshop, Santa Cruz, Droors and, of course, Nike, the trainer mega-brand with which he would <a href="https://theface.com/style/virgil-ablohs-off-white-nike-dunk-low-group-chat-hiroshi-fujiwara-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">later collaborate</a>. Alongside his friend Chris Eaton, he’d draw shoes and pitch them to the company. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Nike would be like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Oh, we don’t accept designs,’” <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/virgil-abloh-cover-story-spring-2019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he’d able to joke</a> in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">Abloh began working on designs at a&nbsp;T‑shirt print shop in Chicago, where he subsequently met <a href="https://theface.com/tag/kanye-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kanye West</a> for the first time. By 2007, West had hired Abloh as a&nbsp;design consultant, working across the rapper’s <a href="https://theface.com/music/kanye-chicago-donda-kim-kardashian-marilyn-manson-dababy-shenseea-westside-gunn-church" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DONDA</a> creative agency. The pair ended up interning together at Fendi in 2009 and, although West was already world-famous at the time, they were tasked with getting coffee and running daily errands. It was during this time that Abloh first caught the eye of Michael Burke, CEO of <a href="https://theface.com/style/louis-vuitton-virgil-abloh-nba-basketball-menswear-fashion-pre-fall-collection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Louis Vuitton</a>. <br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

He was creating a&nbsp;bold, radical and new creative vanguard”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1174615"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">After working for West as art director, designing album art for <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy </em>(2010), <em>Watch The Throne </em>(2011) and <em>Cruel Summer (2012)</em>, Abloh launched his own brand, Pyrex Vision (2012). His first step into design of his own, Abloh released a&nbsp;small collection of hoodies, basketball shorts, socks, and flannel shirts, as well as, famously, reworking old <a href="https://theface.com/tag/ralph-lauren" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ralph Lauren</a> by adding his own logo. It was all part of the designer’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>three per cent approach” – creating a&nbsp;new design by changing an original concept by three per cent.</p><p dir="ltr">After art directing 2013’s <em>Yeezus</em>, Abloh rebranded Pyrex as his own Milan-based brand, Off-White. The rest, as they say, is history: one owed to the designer’s fierce dedication to reinventing how people view streetwear. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>In a&nbsp;large part streetwear is seen as cheap,” <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/the-unlikely-success-of-virgil-abloh-off-white/#:~:text=What%20my%20goal%20has%20been,fashionable%20as%20traditional%20luxury%20brands." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he told the <em>Business of Fashion</em></a> in 2016. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>What my goal has been is to add an intellectual layer to it and make it credible.”</p><p dir="ltr">His first collection, <em>Youth Will Always Win,</em> was released in 2014 and set a&nbsp;steely precedent for what would become Abloh’s design style: luxurious yet incredibly open-minded, playful, irreverent and deeply thoughtful, with youth at the helm of his design decisions. Around this time, Instagram was just kicking off, and Abloh seemingly predicted the image-obsessed audience he would be selling to. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--instagram-embed " data-block="1174616"><div class="content-builder__block--xs content-builder__block--instagram-inner"><iframe width="320" height="320" frameBorder="0" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BkSkageAYv6/?hl=en" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1174617"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">The mega-moment in Abloh’s career was when he was appointed artistic director of Louis Vuitton’s menswear collections in 2018. Taking over from his friend <a href="https://theface.com/tag/kim-jones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Jones</a>, he became the first Black person to head up the house and only the third to lead a&nbsp;French luxury fashion house, ever. Abloh’s vision was always diverse, celebrating unheard voices and tapping into what young people were actually interested in. For his acclaimed debut Vuitton collection, he recruited London skaters Blondey McCoy and Lucien Clarke to walk. He’d then have Clarke design the first skate shoe for the house, <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/lucien-clarke-louis-vuitton-skate-shoe-release-date-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling <em>Highsnobiety</em></a> that <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’d like to think skateboarding and fashion is one entity. I’ve never seen it as separate worlds”. </p><p dir="ltr">The collections that followed were steeped in fantasy. His cast became hyper-coloured superheroes: men walked down runways in skirts, <a href="https://theface.com/contributors/kai-isaiah-jamal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai Isaiah-Jamal</a> became the first Black trans model to walk in a&nbsp;Vuitton show, and models of all backgrounds were presented as exquisite, rich film characters. Abloh wasn’t just designing collections. He was creating a&nbsp;bold, radical and new creative vanguard. </p><p dir="ltr">In an Instagram post he made after his 2018 debut show, which has been widely shared after the news of his death, Abloh is shown taking his final bow on an acid yellow runway, back turned to the camera. The caption is <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>you can do it too…” What connects many of the messages that have been posted since last night is deep respect: his influence on a&nbsp;generation of young people who grew up believing they could do it, too. Perhaps, within his extraordinary talent, that was Abloh’s message all along. The accessibility of his vision was all part of the magic.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="1174761"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

Her warm sound and bold lyricism – like in 2017’s <em>Tepid Soul</em>, a&nbsp;song-poem about mixed-raced identity, in which she speaks openly about the hyper-sexuality of light skinned people of colour (<em><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Am I&nbsp;the right shade for you?”) </em> and colourism in the Black community (“<em>I know it benefits me being a&nbsp;lighter skin colour, but how fair is it? I&nbsp;want to talk about it</em>”) – have earned the 26-year-old South East Londoner over 25 million streams, headline shows and a&nbsp;campaign with Nike. </p><p dir="ltr">Born to a&nbsp;British mother and St Lucian – British father, Ajudha speaks proudly and openly about her mixed heritage, and she’s not afraid to approach touchy subjects, ranging from <a href="https://theface.com/tag/racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">racism</a> and oppression to gender and <a href="https://theface.com/tag/sexuality" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexuality</a>. </p><p dir="ltr">Following the release of tracks <em>Weakness</em> and <em>Change Your Mind</em> this year, the singer announced last week the release of her debut album, <em>The Power In Us</em>, a&nbsp;punchy 12-track LP that promises to stir the pot and spark conversations among young people. <br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Congratulations. Tell me about the creative process that went into creating </strong><strong><em>The Power In Us</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I’ve actually been working on it for ages because of the <a href="https://theface.com/tag/post-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pandemic</a>. Some of the songs are a&nbsp;few years old now, but I&nbsp;continued working on them until they all came together, so they have travelled with me through my creative process. </p><p dir="ltr">Some of the songs I&nbsp;produced in my studio at home and it was really a&nbsp;process of self-exploration and working myself out. I’ve taken bits out, added bits in, but I&nbsp;realised that in making the album, I&nbsp;wanted cohesiveness in what I&nbsp;was saying and wanted to bring people into my mind. I&nbsp;took off a&nbsp;few love songs because it didn’t go with the concept and the social issues I&nbsp;was addressing throughout the album. A&nbsp;lot of the topics I&nbsp;touch on describe what is on a&nbsp;lot of young people’s minds at the moment.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="1173059"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I want men to understand how important it is to care about equality because we all benefit from it”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1173044"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>There’s a&nbsp;real theme of empowerment to <em>The Power In Us</em>. Your first track, WHOSE FUTURE</strong><strong><em>? OUR FUTURE!</em></strong><strong> features a&nbsp;clip of human and civil rights leader Angela Davis. How much of your album is a&nbsp;call to arms for women?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think it’s a&nbsp;call to arms for everyone. I&nbsp;don’t just want women to fight for women’s rights, I&nbsp;want everyone to fight for women’s rights. I&nbsp;want men to understand how important it is to care about equality because we all benefit from it. There’s so much about the patriarchy that holds men back and the system of oppression that it has created doesn’t serve men, either. So it was really important for my music to allow people to think differently and ask those important questions. </p><p dir="ltr">We’re not taught to question people, we are taught to follow the status quo, because oppression is controlled and keeps the system running as it is. It doesn’t serve anyone. It was so special to perform the album tracks at my headline show. When I&nbsp;meet people after the shows they always want to talk about gender, feminism or toxic masculinity, or they have something they want to share because they are working it out too. This album is me working it out and me wanting everyone to work it out together. We should always be working on ourselves together and striving to become better versions of ourselves. </p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Power in being who you want to be, unjudged, that women are starting to reclaim their power”. </em></strong><strong>What does reclaiming your power look to you?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It’s such a&nbsp;complex thing. Women are pulled in so many different directions. I&nbsp;think that excerpt you read was just me feeling that contradiction and conflict that women always go through, which is you can never do the right thing. If you dress one way, you’re wrong. Women’s bodies are so politicised that I&nbsp;think reclaiming yourself is about being who you are and other people accepting that your choices of being who you are has nothing to do with them. </p><p dir="ltr">I think reclaiming myself is an ongoing journey, but I’ve learnt a&nbsp;lot in the last year and I&nbsp;really learnt to take myself as I&nbsp;am. I&nbsp;am a&nbsp;work in progress. I&nbsp;am constantly trying to be a&nbsp;better person. And I&nbsp;won’t always do things right, but I&nbsp;don’t expect myself to be perfect and I’m OK with that. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you feel like you’ve been given more space to be vulnerable as an independent artist?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Definitely, especially in the last year. I’ve seen a&nbsp;huge change in how I&nbsp;am and who I&nbsp;am, and how I&nbsp;think about other people. As an independent artist, you get to choose who you have around you and that’s the most important thing. I&nbsp;think the people you surround yourself with allow you to be who you are. I’ve made a&nbsp;bit of a&nbsp;success surrounding myself with people who allow me to grow, who I&nbsp;can be outrageous with, and just live loudly. I&nbsp;work with an incredible all-female band who I&nbsp;feel so safe around. [They’re] opinionated, queer and just talk about important things with me. They really see my value and respect me. So that’s really important. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Why was it important for you to have an all-female band?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It was a&nbsp;weird development. Previously, I&nbsp;had an all-white, male band and it didn’t really reflect what I&nbsp;was talking about in my music. It didn’t make sense for me that I’m talking about Black Lives Matter, gender or feminism and it’s not connecting with them. They weren’t angry with me in the same way I&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;think it put everything into perspective and I&nbsp;needed to be surrounded by people who understand where I’m coming from. There’s now nine women on stage with me and that’s not something people often see on stage. This changes the perception of how women should be. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="1173062"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I was fucking livid when I&nbsp;wrote this album.

What message will this album give young women this time around?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It’s in the title: <em>The Power In Us</em>. The power is in us if we wish to take it and use it. This is something I’ve always felt. People hold so much power and they don’t realise it. They don’t know how to use their voice or value themselves because of insecurities or childhood trauma. I&nbsp;just wish people saw their greatness and power so they can excel at the things they are passionate about. I&nbsp;want people to feel inspired, passionate and feel compassion for other people. We’re taught to be so individualistic and so centred on things that don’t matter, and I&nbsp;want to undo that. It’s important to uplift the people around you. If this album can inspire people to find the tools, or think about things differently, then I’ll be happy. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Were you angry when you wrote this album?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yes, I&nbsp;was fucking livid. I&nbsp;wrote PLAYGOD when the abortion bill went through in Alabama and I&nbsp;was like: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>we’re in the 21<sup class="ordinal">st</sup> century, why is this happening?!” Why do men feel like they have this God complex that they can weaponise, [with] religion or anything, to push a&nbsp;political agenda to control women? It didn’t make sense to me. </p><p dir="ltr">So the first verse is: <em><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Sister stand up, for what you believe. Fight the power, or die at their feet. I&nbsp;know they don’t see what you see. But don’t fight the people, for being sheep.<em>”</em></em></p><p dir="ltr">And the second verse is: <em><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Brother stand up. Admit to what you do. This complex ain’t helping me or you. Changing the world starts with you. Don’t tell me you don’t know what you do.<em><em>”</em></em></em><br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="1173064"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/POPPYTHEFACE.png?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="773" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LEAD.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="862" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1173065"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Mothers Sisters Girlfriends</em></strong><strong> – talk me through that song. It’s a&nbsp;female anthem. </strong></p><p dir="ltr">It’s actually got a&nbsp;deep meaning that I&nbsp;haven’t really spoken about before. This song is about abortion because when I&nbsp;was 23, I&nbsp;had an abortion. The opening lyrics are:<em><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Hey mama, why don’t you please forgive me, don’t wanna be a&nbsp;woman whos sacrifices dreams</em>.” Because I&nbsp;knew I&nbsp;wanted an abortion and, despite my mum being a&nbsp;feminist and open minded, she very much tried to convince me out of it. She also made me feel the shame that there is around women and abortion. We’d have to whisper the word abortion, and it made me ask myself whether I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;terrible person for wanting better things for my life. </p><p dir="ltr">Bringing another human into this world is the most important thing you can do and you shouldn’t do it lightly. And I&nbsp;think that song is about the fact that women are much more than being mothers, sisters and girlfriends. I&nbsp;think if you want to take on those roles, that’s great if it fulfils you. But if it’s not, you’ll only go through your life feeling resentful. There are so many complexities in motherhood that we don’t always consider because the conversation isn’t always created. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your song </strong><strong><em>DEMONS</em></strong><strong> is about mental health. What keeps you going?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. I&nbsp;wrote that song actually off the back of seeing a&nbsp;side of a&nbsp;man that I&nbsp;didn’t know existed because I&nbsp;thought he had everything together. But he didn’t. I&nbsp;was like: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>wow, men are crumbling at the seams too. They just can’t show it like we can.” </p><p dir="ltr">I think we all need people when we’re at our lowest point. They keep us going, they encourage us, especially when you can’t see past yourself. Having great friends and [getting] great advice is important. But what keeps me going is being able to trust myself and sharing your experiences. You won’t have empathy if you haven’t dealt with it too. </p><p dir="ltr">I recently had a&nbsp;conversation about coming out and having my first queer experiences with someone who was going through it for the first time. I&nbsp;never imagined that I’d be the person who would be comfortable enough to say <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’ve been where you’ve been and this is normal, and you’re going to get through it.” I&nbsp;felt grateful that I&nbsp;could give that person something that I&nbsp;didn’t have at that time. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="1173066"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>Performing empowers me and makes me a&nbsp;stronger person, knowing that I&nbsp;can be myself in my room in the dark and on stage in front of thousands of people”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1173067"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>You started as a&nbsp;songwriter, then transitioned to performing. How did you find the change?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I’ve been writing songs since I&nbsp;was 10. I’ve always been a&nbsp;deeply emotional person and I&nbsp;always needed a&nbsp;way to get it out. Performing and being vulnerable on stage is important to me because it allows other people to be vulnerable. It scares me every time I&nbsp;share a&nbsp;song that is about something deeply personal, because when you’re on your own, it’s just you, your pen and paper, and guitar. You don’t think about the fact that you’ll sing it in front of thousands of people. But when that time comes, it’s a&nbsp;relief again. Performing empowers me and makes me a&nbsp;stronger person, knowing that I&nbsp;can still be myself in my room in the dark and on stage in front of thousands of people. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Who were the artists that inspired you to become a&nbsp;songwriter?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I’ve always been drawn towards strong, female singers. So Lauryn Hill, Erykah Badu and, when I&nbsp;was really young, P!nk. These kinds of artists who were so rebellious and did things their own way were ones I&nbsp;was drawn to, regardless of their music. I&nbsp;also listened to a&nbsp;lot of old soul music. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Which artists are you loving right now?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Rosalía’s album. Her voice is so unique and she’s incredible. There’s a&nbsp;lot of Afrobeats on repeat too. I&nbsp;love Wizkid. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Who would you most like to collaborate with?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I love Anderson.Paak, Drake and Snoh Aalegra. I&nbsp;love <em>Question Time </em>by Dave, too. I&nbsp;think it’s incredible how he puts lyrics like that together, the fact that he can bring together so many different things to make sense for the whole world. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You’re going on your first headline tour next year. Are you excited?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, man. I&nbsp;love doing shows. I&nbsp;love meeting people who come and it puts everything into perspective for me. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The album is out in March, and you’re working on your second already?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, it’s almost done. I’ve been writing so much. I’ve just been really inspired and I’ve learnt a&nbsp;lot about how and who I&nbsp;want to be. I’ll always be changing and growing, but I&nbsp;really know what I&nbsp;want to do and I’m ready to give that to the world. My next album, which I’ll be working with producers in LA, will be talking a&nbsp;lot about queer stuff. I&nbsp;can’t wait to share that with the world.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong><em>The Power In Us </em></strong><strong>will be released on 11<sup class="ordinal">th</sup> March 2022. </strong></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="1173068"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="1173160"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Last night, <a href="https://theface.com/beauty/harry-styles-pleasing-beauty-brand-launch-cosmetics-instagram-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harry Styles</a>’ 42-date US arena tour, Love on Tour, drew to a&nbsp;close in Elmont, New York. Those of us who have been paying attention to every single detail of every single show will no doubt be feeling somewhat bereft in the coming days. Social media has been rife with documented moments of sincere interaction between Harry and fans (including a&nbsp;sweet <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/04/harry-styles-fan-come-out-gay/">coming-out moment </a>between a&nbsp;fan and her mother), photos of special audience guests like Lizzo, <a href="https://theface.com/culture/bts-mcdonalds-meal-review-south-korea-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BTS</a>, SZA and girlfriend Olivia Wilde, and TikTok users showcasing their outfits to his song <em>Woman</em>. My own Instagram explore page has been wall-to-wall Love On Tour content for months and I&nbsp;am not ready to go back to reality.<br></p><p dir="ltr">In typical Harry Styles fashion, one major aspect of the tour has been the clothes. And anyone following the details of his outfits has had an easy time of it – the singer’s entire wardrobe was provided by Alessandro Michele’s <a href="https://theface.com/style/gucci-gucciaria-alessandro-michele-balenciaga-womenswear-milan-fashion-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gucci</a>, much of it custom made.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Stylist Harry Lambert clearly had a&nbsp;cohesive vision for the tour as a&nbsp;whole. Wearing one look per show, most nights saw Styles in high-waisted, wide-legged trousers, round-toe boots with a&nbsp;block heel and a&nbsp;blouse or shirt rolled to the elbow, usually finished off with thin suspenders. There have been random breaks from this silhouette, where the shirt has been replaced with a&nbsp;vest or waistcoat with nothing underneath, harking back to his topless, leather-clad Grammy performance and (more importantly, of course) his cover of <a href="https://theface.com/music/harry-styles-feature-interview-music-stevie-nicks-elton-john-alessandro-michele-volume-4-issue-001">THE FACE</a> Issue One. <br></p><p dir="ltr">But the major variations from each evening were largely in colour and print, from polka dots to monochromatic block colours to a&nbsp;little razzle-dazzle sequin fringe. Practicality had clearly been considered; Styles is known for covering the entire stage, dancing and taking time to speak to his fans in the audience. The repeated silhouette and the chosen fabrics allow for this movement, while not adding too much heat and remaining thoroughly photogenic – and, importantly, remaining thoroughly recognisable as Harry Styles in his <em>Fine Line </em>album and tour era. <br></p><p dir="ltr">From <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Harryween” to jacquard emerald green vests, as a&nbsp;Love On Tour aficionado, I’ve whittled down Styles’ top five looks from a&nbsp;tour to remember.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-High" class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Unbuttoned to the chest, the shirt is broken up by the textured, subtle floral print running through it and sharply contrasting black suspenders. Both red and pink as colour choices appeared heavily during the tour, as an on-the-nose nod to the concept of love… being on tour. This is by far one of the most striking examples of red as a&nbsp;style decision, with Styles looking like an obscenely handsome Cupid.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1173164"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">4.

These specific shades have become distinctly identifiable with this era of the singer’s career, so pairing them with the tour’s signature silhouette was a&nbsp;stroke of genius. Finished with tan suspenders, a&nbsp;gold cross-chain and white boots, this outfit was as visually interesting as it was significant to Styles’ larger body of work. As with the Atlanta show’s entirely red look, the shirt was broken up with subtle texture, this time with, funnily enough, fine lines. If Harry Lambert knows one thing as a&nbsp;stylist, it’s that it’s all in the details.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1173167"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">3.

The more feminine edge to the choice of top was well complimented by the Wedgwood-inspired blue and cream trousers. There’s a&nbsp;softness to the fabric choices in this outfit, set off by the hard, tailored edges to the cuffs and trouser waist. It’s this tailoring that shows us just how custom Styles’ Gucci wardrobe is. The actual fit of the clothes is spectacularly neat, making for an extremely clean overall look.</p></div></div></div><div id="BespokeMobile-Article-Mid1" class="ad-margin--article-mid tw-text-center"><script type="text/javascript">

Perhaps the best detail of the entire tour was how his usual round toe, block heel boots were made to look like red ruby slippers with blue socks – the perfect balance of classic Halloween gimmick and high fashion. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="1173175"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h5 class="content-builder__heading">1.

In one of the much-demanded all green outfits, Styles appeared at the first of his three LA shows in a&nbsp;2019 Gucci velvet floral vest and matching emerald green trousers. The look encapsulates everything that’s great about the singer’s current style era, which is classic in cut but bold in colour and print. Lambert’s choice to have Harry go topless underneath the folk-inspired vest allows the garment to stand out, while showing off the singer’s tattoos and, on a&nbsp;practical level, letting him breathe under the stage lights. It’s a&nbsp;look worth going wild for.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--button " data-block="1173394"><div class="content-builder__block--m copy"><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="tf-onpage-button"><section><a href="https://theface.com/beauty/harry-styles-pleasing-beauty-brand-launch-cosmetics-instagram-style">Read more: Harry Styles launches his beauty brand, Pleasing</a></section></section></div></div></div>                ]]>
