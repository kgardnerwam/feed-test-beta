Although the plant is consumed throughout the country, most people still associate it with surfing, sunshine, and chilling out.</p><p>Well, the East Coast is finally ready to put in their two cents – specifically New York City, where adult-use cannabis was just <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/new-york-cannabis"><u>legalized</u></a> in 2021. </p><p>New York is the city that never sleeps, and cannabis has been a rich part of that energetic history. The West Coast’s laidback approach just won’t work for the other side of the map, which makes for a fascinating distinction as the NYC cannabis community steps out of the shadows and into the light.</p><p><a href="https://www.rageandrelease.com/"><u>Rage &amp; Release</u></a>, an NYC-based cannabis lifestyle brand focused on fitness, the plant, and New York living, is one such business aiming to set the standard for New York’s cannabis industry – one that reflects the inimitable energy of NYC living.</p><h2><strong>Breaking The Taboos Around Cannabis And Athleticism</strong></h2><p>Cannabis and fitness have long gone hand in hand, but you wouldn’t know it from today’s industry. </p><p>While things like ganja yoga exist, the concept of blending cannabis and fitness is relatively unexplored on the surface – but in New York, it’s another part of the underground holistic culture that has dwelled in the City’s shadows for years. </p><p>“Smoking and sweating – that’s something we’re used to in our community,” said Thai Richards, Founder and Creative Director at Rage &amp; Release. </p><p>“Cannabis is a big part of New York culture. People here smoke and do shit. No one is ever saying, ‘Let’s smoke and sit around and do nothing,’ and that part of East Coast cannabis culture really needs to be known. New York is nonstop, and people here need to have a cannabis lifestyle that caters to that energy.”</p><p>Richards founded Rage &amp; Release with this concept in mind, but he also saw a few flaws with the underground industry that he was hoping to provide some solutions for.</p><p>“Growing up and having to buy weed from random sources – more often than not you’d go to buy weed from some guy and quickly realize he doesn’t love the product as much as you do. He doesn’t know anything about it. It’s just a dollar for him,” Richards said.</p><p>“When I realized that, that scared the shit out of me. Then with synthetic cannabis products coming out, I really started to worry about the safety of my own body and others. I wanted to create a community that centers on fitness and consumption overall: focusing on all of our sources of cannabis, food, and energy.”</p><p>Richards knew he had to be unafraid to ask the hard questions: Are we as a cannabis community wholly satisfied with how things are being done? If not, how do we change certain things around consumption, and how does that affect how we feel?</p><p>“I wanted to create a lifestyle brand built off vulnerability and inclusivity. Running and cannabis are two things that, it doesn’t matter where you’re from or what color you are. You want to run? Cool, no questions asked,” Richards said. </p><p>“And it’s the same thing with cannabis: relationships between unlikely people are built by default because someone’s got weed. So that was the whole idea – allowing people to come into a non-judgmental space in order to learn and grow organically in their bodies and minds.”</p><h2><strong>We Need a More Holistic Approach to Cannabis, Fitness, and Life</strong></h2><p>As simple and straightforward as that sounds, a come-as-you-are attitude is practically unheard of in the fitness industry as a whole, and the reason many people end up avoiding gyms or strenuous exercise is because they don’t want to feel judged or shamed for not being perfect from the get-go. </p><p>But in Richards’s world, there is no mission or message constantly being driven home to the Rage &amp; Release family. “I bring people into the space and allow them to exist. My only message is feel better, do better,” Richards said. </p><p>It’s Richards’s drive for holistic wellness that encouraged him to pursue fitness in this authentic way. When he first began using cannabis, his relationship with the plant quickly became spiritual, and directly related to his body and how it exists. </p><p>Although conversations around cannabis are becoming more open and positive every day, Richards realized the importance of putting himself on the right side of the industry ten years ago – when the plant was still incredibly taboo. </p><p>“With the way cancer and other serious illnesses have been thriving in recent years, I knew there was no way cannabis wouldn’t eventually be used as a medicinal property on a massive scale,” Richards said. “So I decided to put myself in the right conversations and spaces to see that progress.”</p><p>Flash forward to today, when most of Richards’s predictions are starting to become realized. Richards plans to utilize Rage &amp; Release to help establish how legal cannabis will look like in fast-paced New York City.</p><p>“The West Coast culture of smoking is so visual that for most people, that’s what they picture when they think of weed,” Richards said. </p><p>“So, we have a lot of work when it comes to visuals, content, and how we approach things on this side of town. But I think so many of us are already doing beautiful, proactive things to make sure the community is represented in a positive light so we can keep moving forward.”</p><p>At Rage &amp; Release, that looks like creating a wellness space that encompasses cannabis and holistic self-care, promoting healthy cooking and eating habits, and collaborating on more wellness-focused events, like their recent 4.20-mile run with <a href="https://higherstandards.com/pages/our-story"><u>Higher Standards</u></a>.</p><p>“The biggest thing was just bringing people into one space that drives the lifestyle. Higher Standards definitely prioritizes quality cannabis, and that’s very important for safe consumption,” Richards said.</p><p>“The messaging that day was all about taking care of yourself, and by extension, the things in your environment. Whether that’s how you prepare your morning, what you focus on throughout the day, or how you use cannabis to enhance your performance.”</p><p>That is Richards’s overall goal for his clients and collaborators: streamlining everything people need to lead a healthy, happy, well-rounded lifestyle that leaves no one behind. </p><p>“I want the market to be more inclusive. That’s my biggest goal. Ten years ago, when the fitness industry really became a thing with SoulCycle or boxing gyms, I&#39;d be the only black guy in class. There’s a problem with that,” Richards said.</p><p>“Fitness also needs to focus more on functionality rather than simply visual success. You don’t need an amazing six-pack to be in shape – bodies come in all shapes and sizes. We’re in a pivotal time in society where we need positivity, and to change our perceptions on age-old stereotypes.”</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>The Weed Talk: How to Talk to Your Friends and Family About Cannabis</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/how-to-talk-to-your-friends-and-family-about-cannabis?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Gregory Frye &amp; Taylor Engle</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fnv0jpdvs4</guid><description>Many of us have been forced to live with cannabis shame for years.

Who in your life still doesn’t approve of the herb, and why?</p><p>Cannabis conversations are easier than ever to navigate, but in some regions, preparation and tact go a long way – especially where the plant is still facing some form of prohibition.</p><p>You might be wondering, is it even worth it to try and change somebody’s mind on a particular issue? </p><p>When the “issue” is cannabis, the answer is almost always yes. </p><h2><strong>Tactfully Blunt: How to Talk to Your Family About Weed</strong></h2><p>In more places than not, cannabis is still considered taboo. This is especially ironic given the social acceptance of alcohol, a drug that kills three million people across the globe each year, <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/alcohol#tab=tab_1"><u>according to the World Health Organization</u></a>.</p><p>Cannabis <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/getting-hurt-while-getting-high"><u>has its pitfalls</u></a>, however it is much safer than booze <a href="http://www.thebluntness.com/posts/50-surprising-benefits-of-cannabis"><u>with more benefits</u></a> and fewer risks. To date, zero people have died from weed, despite nearly a century of disinformation, stigma, and all-out demonization.</p><p>Even though <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/reefer-scare-tactics-is-this-a-cannabis-apocalypse"><u>reefer madness propaganda persists</u></a>, things are beginning to change, and in the age of legal cannabis, it’s high time to further destigmatize the plant on a social level, and that means getting braver about having “The Weed Talk.” </p><p>Whether you think your loved one might benefit from cannabis use or you just want them to understand why it’s an important part of your life, having that initial conversation is crucial for opening communication. </p><p>Unsure how to start? <em>The Bluntness </em>has broken down a few of the most helpful tips and nuances when talking to loved ones about cannabis for an approach that effectively chips away at the tangled roots of cannabis fear and misconception. </p><h2><strong>Before You Do Anything, Listen </strong></h2><p>The biggest mistake people make when trying to drive a point across to someone who opposes it? Steamrolling right over their concerns with an assault of recycled discourse or half-baked talking points. </p><p>We know it can be difficult, especially if you’ve been dealing with anti-cannabis vibes for years, but the only way you’re going to get anywhere with the conversation is by taking the time to listen, first.</p><p>What are your loved ones’ main concerns, and where did their ideas about cannabis originate? Have they had a negative experience with cannabis in the past? What are some of the influences that have shaped their mindset?</p><p>Keep in mind that anyone who is against legal cannabis today is likely to come at you with preconceived biases they may not even be consciously aware of, and you coming back at them with aggression or impatience will only validate their perspective. </p><p>Try to keep an open mind and listen to their concerns with genuine interest and curiosity. </p><h2><strong>Answer Their Questions as Thoroughly and Honestly as You Can</strong></h2><p>Once you’ve allowed your loved ones to air out their grievances, it’s time to come back with a response. </p><p>Take this opportunity to answer any questions they may have asked, address any misinformation they may be holding onto, or simply respond with your take on their perceptions.</p><p>Again, patience is key throughout the interaction, or else anything you have to say will likely fall on deaf ears. </p><p>Maybe ask a few questions of your own to better understand where they’re coming from, and how you might be able to help them view things from a new perspective. </p><h2><strong>Questions you might ask could include:</strong></h2><ul><li>Where do you think your information about cannabis came from?</li><li>Is it possible that your information could be outdated?</li><li>Would you be willing to consider new information about cannabis?</li></ul><p>It’s also important to come at this segment of the conversation with transparency. Cannabis isn’t 100 percent bad, but it also isn’t 100 percent good. Yes, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/cannabis-health" target="_blank">it’s a versatile medicine</a> and wellness product; no, it’s not a panacea or silver bullet. </p><p>In other words, make sure you’re not blindly defending every aspect of the plant – it’s just as essential to <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/cannabs-detector-big-cannabis-is-acting-like-big-tobacco"><u>acknowledge the risks</u></a> that come along with cannabis so people can make the best decision for themselves. </p><p>Also, be sure to come to the conversation prepared. Know the basic science of the plant and <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-endocannabinoid-system-and-how-to-keep-it-strong"><u>how it works with our bodies</u></a>, a little history, and anything else you think they might be interested in learning. </p><p>Do your homework ahead of time, anticipate the arguments or misconceptions they might bring up.</p><p><strong>Argument #1:</strong> Isn’t cannabis addictive?</p><p><strong>Rebuttal: </strong>There is a lot of conflicting information about this. It can be habit forming; people can become dependent on cannabis; people can abuse it – just like anything else. And yet, the side effects of caffeine withdrawal, for instance, are much more pronounced than cutting weed, which usually amounts to irritability, loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, and a potential return of any medical issues, which the cannabis was helping.</p><p><strong>Argument #2: </strong>Yeah, but what about cannabis being a gateway drug?</p><p><strong>Rebuttal:</strong> It’s another myth. In fact, in 1999 The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/6376/chapter/2#2"><u>reported</u></a>, “There is no conclusive evidence that the drug effects of cannabis are causally linked to the subsequent abuse of other illicit drugs.”</p><p><strong>Argument #3:</strong> Doesn’t cannabis cause psychosis?</p><p><strong>Rebuttal: </strong>If someone already has issues with psychosis, it can be a concern. At the same time, <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25134048/"><u>this study</u></a> found that cannabis is associated with lower rates of domestic violence among married couples.</p><p>As you navigate the convo, come prepared with credible info, and don’t be afraid to admit if you don’t know the answer to something. You can always look it up and get back to them later. </p><h2><strong>Share the History of Cannabis Prohibition With Them</strong></h2><p>While most people who are anti-cannabis have likely felt that way for a long time, they are also probably unaware of why cannabis was outlawed and stigmatized <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2013/07/14/201981025/the-mysterious-history-of-marijuana"><u>in the first place</u></a>. </p><p>While prohibition has been around for almost a century, humankind has been utilizing this plant <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-ancient-origins-of-cannabis-according-to-science"><u>since at least 6,000 BCE</u></a>.</p><p>As consciousness researcher <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/ways-cannabis-impacts-your-thinking"><u>Sebastian Marincolo</u></a> puts it, “The legalization of marijuana is not a dangerous experiment – the prohibition is the experiment, and it has failed dramatically, with millions of victims all around the world.”</p><p>Essentially, cannabis went from being considered a sacrament and medicine, as well as a staple crop for fiber and food, to a menacing “gateway drug.” It will take society more than one generation to recover from this harmful stigma and misinformation. </p><p>If your loved ones don’t know anything about <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/harry-anslinger-quotes"><u>cannabis prohibition’s racist origins</u></a>, or how <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/how-cannabis-became-schedule-I"><u>Nixon buried 4,000 pages of cannabis research</u></a> to keep the herb as a schedule I controlled substance, sharing this history with them might help shift their perspective.</p><h2><strong>Open Up About Your Experiences With Cannabis</strong></h2><p>Now that you’ve listened to their concerns, answered some questions, and shared a bit about cannabis’s history, it’s time to open up about what really matters: your cannabis story.</p><p>Sharing your own cannabis story is one of the most powerful ways to change hearts and minds on this issue.</p><p>It can be hard to come up with this on the spot, so if it helps, write down a list of all of the ways cannabis benefits you beforehand so you have it handy.</p><p>Whether you use the plant for chronic pain, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/using-cannabis-to-ease-stress-anxiety"><u>anxiety</u></a>, depression, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/how-to-manage-sleep-disruptions-with-cannabis"><u>insomnia</u></a>, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-immeasurable-nuances-of-cannabis-and-creativity"><u>creativity</u></a>, relaxation, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/cannasexual-ashley-manta"><u>sex</u></a>, or anything else, there are plenty of ways to make cannabis work for your lifestyle, and it’s important for your loved ones to realize the plant’s potential as a wellness product.</p><p>A word of caution when sharing your cannabis story – be sure to practice proper judgment with who you’re talking to before opening up too much. </p><h2><strong>Let Them Know How Cannabis Might Work For Them</strong></h2><p>If you’ve come to this point in the conversation and your friend or family member is keeping things refreshingly open-minded, it might be time to recommend the plant to them. </p><p>There are so many different forms of cannabis, and so many different ways to consume and experience it. While your loved one might not be keen on the idea of ripping a bong of <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/high-thc-weed" target="_blank">high-THC flower</a>, some <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-benefits-of-cbd-tea-and-how-to-make-it-at-home" target="_blank">CBD tea</a>, or a CBN tincture with very low psychoactive effects might be just what they’re looking for. </p><p>And if you are going to guide them on their first cannabis experience, make sure to be careful of dosage. The other person will most likely have a very low tolerance, and too much could lead to a negative experience.</p><p>All in all, stay respectful and as informative as possible, don&#39;t pressure anyone to try cannabis, and remember that this is a dialogue that might stretch out over time.</p><p>While you may not feel directly responsible for changing your aunt’s mind about weed, it’s these little conversations being had at person-to-person level that will affect the most powerful change on society’s perception of the plant. </p><p>We have to keep working together to build a better future – and more people mindfully consuming cannabis is a good thing. </p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>Crazy Stories: Getting Hurt While Getting High</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/getting-hurt-while-getting-high?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Mike Adams</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fn9h0g2dgh</guid><description>The cannabis clan will always fight tooth and nail to convince the American public that using pot is less hazardous than drinking booze, but...</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 09:56:54 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_8495,h_4778,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fnr47ftkf4hkjz9862.jpg" caption="Cannabis use isn&#39;t without its perils."></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Mike Adams"></flatplan:author><keywords>weed,cannabis,cannabis Industry,Marijuana,evergreen</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></em><em> Names have been changed to protect the embarrassed.</em><br/></p><p>Cannabis advocates often preach that marijuana is safer than alcohol. By all accounts, it is. It’s safer than a lot of stuff. But it wouldn’t be accurate to claim that having an affinity for weed was without its perils.  </p><p>The cannabis clan will always fight tooth and nail to convince the American public that using pot is less hazardous than drinking booze, but they usually fail to mention the times they got hurt smoking it. </p><p>Oh, sure, maybe the incident didn’t land them in the emergency room (maybe it did), but they got stoned and, well, something about the experience caused pain. </p><p>And when the cannabis industry itself overlooks the drawbacks of weed, then really they’re no better than Big Tobacco.</p><p>Thankfully, unlike the tales typically told from the bottom of the bottle, these super blazed accounts are mostly peppered with humor, not tragedy. What can we say? Getting a boo-boo smoking bud is just par for the course. </p><p>We recently talked to members of stoned society to learn more about the occasions when they sustained an injury using weed. </p><h2><strong>#1) Weird Burns</strong></h2><p>Not surprisingly, after dozens of interviews, it seems the bulk of these marijuana mishaps are burned-related. Lips, fingers, tongues, and chests, mostly. But for Rodney, a 45-year-old stockbroker from Indiana, it was the family jewels that got scorched. </p><p>“I was sitting on the toilet, like I used to do every morning before work, taking hits from the bathroom bong,” he told The Bluntness. </p><p>“Some hot ash fell out of the bowl when I was hitting it and landed right on my crotch. Oh man, I ended up with a nasty burn a little too close to my junk. Needless to say, I don’t wake and bake much anymore, but when I do I keep my pants on.” </p><p>Good idea, Rodney!</p><p>What happens, though, when the burn is internal? Kelsey, a 32-year-old from Arlington, Virginia, claims there’s a come to Jesus moment. It’s as though a stoned monk from the mountains of Tibet appears with the message: Sometimes you smoke the weed, sometimes the weed smokes you.</p><p>“So, I&#39;m hiking with two of my friends in Connecticut,” she tells us. “One doesn&#39;t smoke but one brought a blunt. We sat on a giant boulder to smoke and as it gets shorter, we decide to move on a little up the trail.” </p><p>As the three continued hiking, Kelsey was unaware that she was about to need the Heimlich maneuver. </p><p>“We are walking up this slight incline. I&#39;m third in line and I&#39;ve got the roach, trying to get the last of it,” she said. “I ended up accidentally sucking it in as I&#39;m breathing. I&#39;m now choking on a lit roach on this trail. I start coughing. My friends are joking that I can&#39;t die because no one has died from weed, and I can&#39;t be the start of the statistics. I get it out, and I ended up burning both of my tonsils.”<br/></p><h2><strong>#2) Coughing Jags Gone Horribly Wrong</strong></h2><p>Listen, it has been said, if you don’t cough, you don’t get off. What they don’t tell you is a cannabis coughing jag can go south. </p><p>“A friend of ours had to be rushed to the hospital after literally collapsing a lung coughing so hard after a dabbing,” asserts Katherine from Ontario, Canada.<br/></p><h2><strong>#3) Confusing Head Trauma</strong></h2><p>There are times, too, when coughing up a lung (or collapsing it) is a prequel to puking and passing out.<br/></p><p>“I projectile vomited from a massive bong rip in college and fainted,” declares a 33-year-old former frat boy from North Carolina. “Evidently, no one even tried to slow my fall. I had a gash on the side of my head, and it was bleeding.”</p><p>Indeed, it is sometimes best to take those gargantuan ganja hits sitting down. That’s the best advice Steve from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, can offer. Remain seated at all times, especially if you’re tall. “I took a massive bong hit, stood up to exhale and slammed my head on the shelving above.”</p><h2><strong>#4) Losing An Eye!</strong></h2><p>On occasion, toker trauma can go from tame to pretty wild, far exceeding the pitfalls like a few burns, a concussion, and a smoke-filled pneumothorax. One man we talked to told us the harrowing account of one of his friends losing an eye. “A seed popped in the pipe like popcorn,” he said. </p><p>Damn, we’ve heard of having a safety meeting, but we didn’t realize we actually needed one. Guess it’s a good thing the pot growers of today have mastered the art of seedless weed. </p><h2><strong>#5) A Subconscious Death Wish</strong></h2><p>Still, science can’t protect against recklessness, a lack of common sense and a subconscious death wish.</p><p>“A few years ago, I was having some fun with some friends,” 35-year-old Simon tells The Bluntness. “We didn&#39;t have a rig, but I&#39;ve always been creative, right? Without looking what I was using for a dabber, I picked up the .22 bullet (my friend was using it to pack down bowls) and got a nice dab onto it.” </p><p>Now, of course, Simon admits he wasn’t thinking that his bullet dabbing method might not be the highest level of stoner ingenuity ever imagined, but he proceeded with it anyway. “I&#39;m heating up the bullet and it explodes, going right through my left nostril,” he claims. </p><p>“I didn&#39;t even feel it split my nose down the middle. I heard the bang and felt my neck snap backwards. The bullet would have scrambled my brain if it was one centimeter to the right. I&#39;m extremely lucky to be alive.”</p><p>The distressing accounts from the doob are never ending. There are people who credit the breaking of bones to being too high to properly navigate the mud; getting cut on broken glass after haphazardly stepping on the bong following a blinding hit. </p><p>Some dude even nearly burned himself alive in his father’s tool shed during a dab excursion gone wrong. </p><p>Nope, there’s no shortage of people out there in this wild world getting hurt while getting high. Just remember, cannabis might be safer than alcohol, but humans will always find a way to make it just as treacherous. </p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>weed</category></item><item><title>Who Discovered Weed?

Most of what we know about the historic uses of cannabis come from sparse archaeological evidence and oft doggy translations of texts that are thousands of years old. We can make some educated guesses, but, in the end, the more answers we discover, the more questions we unveil. </p><p>Nevertheless, thanks to changing public opinion and waves of legalization, cannabis research is getting prime-time attention. As a result, we know more about the origins of cannabis than we have ever before—and now it’s time to recover some of our long-lost history. </p><h2>Where Did Marijuana Originate? </h2><p>We may still have a lot to learn about the ancient history of marijuana, but one thing is certain: the cannabis plant originated in <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-indiana-jones-of-plant-medicine-talks-cannabis" target="_blank">Central and Southeast Asia</a>. To this day, the flowering herb grows wild across the Eurasian Steppes, a vast grassland region spanning western China and Mongolia through Kazakhstan and south toward India and the Middle East. </p><h2>When Marijuana Was Discovered </h2><p>It’s difficult to tell when cannabis was first <em>discovered</em>; the herb has been a part of human life for millennia. Experts suggest that the plant was likely traded among various cultures on the precursor to the silk road—the oldest and arguably the most important trade route in human history. But, the first “discovery” of cannabis likely happened before human groups traded amongst each other via regular routes. </p><p>Botanical and archeological researchers speculate that the plant was <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Ethnobotanical-research-on-origin-%2C-cultivation-%2C-(-Bian-Ling/42b04d14f2cf386f289794481b58a11d513223d3"><u>first domesticated around 12,000 BCE</u></a>. Should this estimate prove correct, domestic cannabis is among the earliest agricultural crops domesticated by humans. But, archeological evidence is often precarious in nature. In our modern time, we can only really know what we can find—and nature has a way of erasing the past. </p><p>We know that by 8,000 BCE, ancient Mesopotamians and ancient Chinese made hemp cloth. We also know that the mythological Chinese emperor Shennong is said to have used hemp as medicine in roughly 3,000 BCE. Ancient texts later written declared that the “Divine Farmer” used cannabis to heal illnesses like rheumatism and gout. Although, it is certainly difficult to separate myth from fact in this case. </p><h2>Who Discovered Weed?</h2><p>The earliest archeological evidence of domesticated cannabis found thus far dates back to ancient Japan and China. In Japan, hemp seed and fiber scraps found in pottery artifacts from the Fukui Prefecture date back to the early Jamon Period, which lasted from 10,000 to 200 BCE. These particular discoveries indicate that cannabis was used for food and industrial purposes, not for psychoactive nor <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/how-marijuana-is-used-medically" target="_blank">medicinal properties</a>. </p><p>But, those interested in the history of psychoactive cannabis may find the next discoveries far more fascinating. In 2019, a cohort of German and Chinese scientists <a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/6/eaaw1391"><u>tested chemical residues</u></a> inside funerary incense burners that are more than 2,500 years old. The surprising find? The incense burners tested positive for <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/what-is-thc" target="_blank">THC</a>, the chemical culprit behind the famous cannabis “high.” </p><p>The incense burners were found in Jirzankal Cemetery site in the eastern Pamirs mountains, a region of western China with particularly high elevations. Researchers postulate that cannabis was burned during mortuary rituals, although there is no evidence to suggest that these ancient peoples were smoking the cannabis plant in the way we commonly do now. Rather, it’s more likely that its intoxicating aroma simply filled the atmosphere. </p><p>The Jirzankal cemetery discovery is a significant one: this is the first scientific evidence to show that our ancient central Eurasian relatives may be among the first human beings to begin both using and cultivating psychoactive cannabis. In essence, they may be the first people who may have “discovered” weed as we know it today. </p><p>As Nicole Boivin, Director at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, best <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190612165603.htm"><u>explains in a press release</u></a>: &#34;The findings [of this study] support the idea that cannabis plants were first used for their psychoactive compounds in the mountainous regions of eastern Central Asia, thereafter spreading to other regions of the world.&#34;</p><h2>Who Invented Smoking?</h2><p>Has it ever occurred to you that humans, as a species, have the tendency to burn things down? According to current theory, intentional fire-setting is one of our species earliest and most effective hunting tactics. Eventually, our species became so accustomed to fire that we became <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/08/160802192629.htm"><u>genetically adapted to better tolerate toxins</u></a> from smoke compared to other mammals. </p><p>Before we learned how to inhale smoke directly into our lungs, we learned how to burn things down. At some point after we learned how to burn things down, we learned how to burn incense. The Jirzankal cemetery site provides the first archeological evidence for the intentional use of cannabis smoke. Using cannabis as a fumigant or vapor is also common in historic medical texts amongst several ancient Central Asian cultures. But, the actual act of smoking out of a pipe or a rolled cigarette? We may have our ancient Andean relatives to thank for that. <br/><br/>From what we currently understand, tobacco is the original smokable plant. Our earliest records suggest that people began smoking the plant around <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/americas-earliest-smokers-may-have-helped-launch-agricultural-revolution-180970904/" target="_blank">6,000 BC.</a> <u></u> At this point in time, cannabis had likely not been introduced to the Americas yet. Instead, European colonists took the smoking habit back across the Atlantic after Columbus’s first encounters with American civilizations. Before the 1500s, not even hash was smoked. Instead, it was eaten. The first Hookahs were not invented until the 15th century.  </p><h2>When Did Cannabis Arrive in the Americas? </h2><p>Cannabis may be one of the oldest agricultural crops, but it certainly took a while to arrive in the Americas. In fact, while the word “marijuana” is often associated with Mexico, the cannabis plant is not native to Latin America. Instead, it was <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378874118316611"><u>brought over to the American continents</u></a> by European colonists after 1492. </p><p>While there is still much more to learn about the ancient history of cannabis, one thing is certain—humankind has made use of this plant for millennia. </p><p><strong>Are you still missing out on The Bluntness newsletter? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> today to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>Overturned: South Dakota Supreme Court Surprises Cannabis Voters Day Before Thanksgiving</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/south-dakota-supreme-court-overturns-cannabis-law?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Gregory Frye</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fnnwprn553</guid><description>South Dakota Supreme Court has finally ruled the state&#39;s recreational cannabis law as unconstitutional, however advocates vow to continue the fight.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:16:21 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1280,h_720,x_0,y_67/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fnnwyv29zp5zhy47qq.jpg" caption="At least two of these founding fathers were fans of cannabis.

Kristi Noem. </p><p>While Noem was okay with the medical cannabis law also passed in Nov. 2020, she quickly criticized South Dakota voters over the adult-use cannabis issue, later teaming up with a local sheriff and a Highway Patrol superintendent to challenge the law in court. </p><p>Shortly after the 2020 elections, Noem made a statement about legal cannabis corrupting the state and ruining families:</p><p>“I was personally opposed to these measures and firmly believe they’re the wrong choice for South Dakota’s communities,” she said.</p><p>“We need to be finding ways to strengthen our families, and I think we’re taking a step backward in that effort. I’m also very disappointed that we will be growing state government by millions of dollars in costs to public safety and to set up this new regulatory system.”</p><p>Instead of honoring the will of the people and examining/embracing the benefits of cannabis legalization, Noem did the opposite.</p><p>It appears that she has used her power and influence to enforce her own personal beliefs on the situation, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/south-dakota-aims-to-subvert-will-of-voters-on-legal-cannabis">attacking voter-fueled cannabis progress</a>.</p><p>And on Nov. 24, 2021 – with most reporters out for Thanksgiving week – the SD Supreme Court ruled in favor of Noem’s challenge.</p><p>The argument is that the Amendment A ballot measure violated the state constitution by covering more than one subject – recreational cannabis, medical cannabis, and hemp – and that voters couldn’t have known what they were voting for.</p><p>Journalist Tom Lawrence <a href="https://www.sdstandardnow.com/home/state-supreme-court-ruling-on-recreational-cannabis-just-another-step-in-lengthy-process">writes</a>, “Circuit Court Judge Christine Klinger, a Noem appointee, agreed, adding that it should have been ratified by a convention because of the broad sweep of the language.”</p><h2><strong>A Symphony of Shock and Disgust</strong></h2><p>Cannabis advocates across the state paused their holiday preparations to issue unequivocal condemnation of the court’s ruling.</p><p>“We believe that this ruling from the South Dakota Supreme Court is extremely flawed,” noted Matthew Schweich, campaign director for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SouthDakotaMJ/">South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws</a>.</p><p>“The court has rejected common sense and instead used a far-fetched legal theory to overturn a law passed by over 225,000 South Dakota voters based on no logical or evidentiary support.”</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/newapproachSD/">New Approach South Dakota</a>’s Melissa Mentele, who has been leading the cannabis reform effort in SD for seven years, called the situation “shocking.”</p><p>Brendan Johnson, former U.S. attorney, also weighed in <a href="https://twitter.com/Brendan_SD/status/1463579494091051010">via Twitter</a>:</p><p>“Today I share the frustration of hundreds of thousands of South Dakotans who had their votes thrown out,” he said.</p><p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Brendan_SD/status/1464636867387797516">subsequent post</a>, Johnson added: “South Dakota voters weren&#39;t confused when they voted to legalize in the last election. Prediction: If politicians in Pierre fail to act, our measure will pass by a far greater % in 2022, and more than a few cannabis opponents will be shown the door.”</p><p>Indeed, it will be interesting to see how Noem fairs in the state’s 2022 elections after this prohibitionist stunt she’s pulled.</p><h2><strong>Still Hope for Adult-Use Cannabis in SD</strong></h2><p>While Gov. Noem and her anti-cannabis minions try to sabotage the will of the people with a twisted, fine-tooth comb, state cannabis advocates are far from finished.</p><p>In addition to a new ballot initiative currently collecting signatures from across the state, top South Dakota lawmakers have officially recommended that the state legislature focus on an adult-use cannabis bill for 2022, as reported by <a href="https://www.marijuanamoment.net/top-south-dakota-lawmakers-officially-recommend-marijuana-legalization-bill-for-2022-session/">Marijuana Moment</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state’s medical cannabis program continues to roll out, with the first medical cards printed and issued on Nov. 18, 2021.</p><p>And, notably, the <a href="https://nativenewsonline.net/sovereignty/without-the-state-s-approval-flandreau-santee-sioux-tribe-opens-first-cannabis-dispensary-in-south-dakota">Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe</a> has already been dispensing cannabis through its very own medical program since early July.</p><p>What’s more, according to Lawrence, state law enforcement agencies have declined to enforce cannabis laws this year, preferring to avoid the legal mess currently under way.</p><p>“What will they do in the coming weeks? Will they check people for medical marijuana licenses? Will they wait for the Legislature to act? Or will they look the other way until this is all sorted out?” Lawrence writes.</p><p>One thing is for sure, cannabis is one of the few issues <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/">most people can agree</a> on these days.</p><p>What does that say about politicians who refuse to reconsider their outdated, prohibition mindsets?</p><p><strong>Are you still missing out on The Bluntness newsletter? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> today to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>news</category></item><item><title>Let The People Grow Weed at Home, But Most Won’t</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/let-the-people-grow-weed-at-home?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Mike Adams</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fn8nqzgd0e</guid><description>Here&#39;s why bans on growing cannabis at home make zero sense and hurt the industry.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1920,h_1080,x_0,y_199/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fn919x9cnprsb50td6.jpg" caption="Evidence shows industry stakeholders should never fear home cannabis cultivation. | Image by Jirapong Pnngjiam from Pixabay "></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Mike Adams"></flatplan:author><keywords>cannabis,weed,legal,cannabis Industry,home cultivation,home grow</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If there is one thing the big dogs of the cannabis industry fear more than anything, it’s that over the next few years marijuana reform – both at the state and federal level -- will include the freedom for regular citizens to grow cannabis plants at home. </p><p>Some industry executives see these home grow provisions as profit crushers. </p><p>However, cannabis advocates argue that home cultivation is a necessary component of legalization, and that greed is no excuse to exclude the right to grow. </p><p>&#34;It is a shame that a handful of industry actors would fearmonger the issue of limited, legal home cultivation over a baseless and unsubstantiated fear over missing out on a buck,” Justin Strekal, political director at NORML, tells <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/"><u><em>The Bluntness</em></u></a>.</p><p>There has never been a showdown quite like the one between advocates working to legalize the herb and those trying to profit from it. </p><p>Weed is all industry now, and some of its so-called leaders are doing everything in their power to make cannabis a cash cow rather than a product of the people. </p><h2><strong>If You’re Against Home Grow, You’re Missing the Bigger Picture</strong></h2><p>Although some of the first states to legalize marijuana made home cultivation part of the deal, the industry now wants them left out. Just look at what&#39;s happening  with <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/new-jersey-cannabis-home-cultivation-ban" target="_blank">home grow in New Jersey</a>, if you want a recent example.</p><p>These operations won’t admit their opposition is about protecting profits. Many claim that prohibiting home grow is in the interest of public safety, tax revenue and eliminating the black market. </p><p>These companies believe that if the consumer is allowed to grow weed at home, they will forgo the marketplace. </p><p>But is this a legitimate concern? Home cultivation advocates don’t think so.</p><p>“I think players in the cannabis industry should not be so wary of the development of home cultivation,” Enzo Schillaci, a spokesperson from <a href="https://2fast4buds.com/"><u>Fast Buds</u></a>, a popular auto flowering seed company, tells <em>The Bluntness</em>. </p><p>“For sure there will be a lot of people who would like to grow on their own. But there still will be a lot of consumers who would choose the typical and easiest way. They don&#39;t want to be involved in the process of growing, and do not have space and time for that.”</p><p>Don’t believe it? Well, just look to the world of beer. It’s clear that home brewing operations haven’t threatened this multi-billion-dollar industry. </p><p>President Jimmy Carter gave Americans the freedom to brew beer at home in the 1970s. Yet, despite its legality in all 50 states, the brewing industry has continued to swell into a massive beast. </p><p>At $350 billion, the beer industry provides the country with one of the largest economic impacts. How? Well, even those dedicated home brewers are still buying copious amounts of beer on the outside. </p><p>Home cannabis cultivation won’t be much different. There’s already evidence of that. Despite home grows being legal in more than 20 states, the US cannabis market becomes more profitable every year. It is now worth $15.5 billion. </p><p>&#34;In most states that have legalized cannabis, limited home cultivation is legal and among the small subset of consumers who choose to exercise that right, many still participate within the legal market to obtain access to a larger variety of products,” Strekal asserts.</p><h2><strong>Why Home Grow is Not a Threat to Cannabis Profits</strong></h2><p>Many cannabis advocates argue that marijuana should be treated no differently than vegetables. </p><p>People should have the right to buy cannabis from a dispensary, pharmacy, or pluck it from their backyard. And we totally agree. Cannabis consumers <em>should</em> have that privilege. It’s just that most wouldn’t take advantage of it. </p><p>Let’s face it, starting a home cannabis garden can be a pain. </p><p>Firstly, it’s expensive. Even the most basic home cultivation setups can cost upwards of $2,000. </p><p>It is also time consuming, and most people don’t have the proper space. </p><p>Toss in the fact that home cultivators must also contend with wafting odors and the high cost of utility bills and the prospect of growing at home can quickly become a big <em>no, thank you!</em></p><p>Just ask those who have done it.</p><p>“Be prepared not to have company over for the months while its growing unless they are cool with the grow,” Edward, a 42-year-old from Kalamazoo, Michigan tells <em>The Bluntness</em>. </p><p>“Every time you open that tent, the house <em>reeks</em>. It’s easy enough to contain within the tent but you gotta love these babies a lot so containing the smell is a hard thing to do when you are watering and such. I won’t even get into the stank you’ll experience come [harvest]. I’m glad I don’t live in an apartment.”</p><p>Zach, a medical marijuana patient from Champaign, Illinois concurs. “Not having enough space or ventilation is the number one mistake for new home growers,” he said.</p><p>The difficulties of home cultivation don’t stop there. Readers of <em>The Bluntness</em> report challenges ranging from the threat of spider mites, moisture control, mildew, and dealing with shoddy electrical systems. </p><p>“Don&#39;t get a 1000w light in a NYC apartment complex,” cautions Tomer of New York. “You will flip the fuse every time.” </p><p>Ironically, being stoned can also lead to costly perils. “Don’t get high while filling the water tank,” Jair from the Netherlands warns. “I remember the waterfall I had running down the stairs.”</p><p>Sure, there are plenty of books, video tutorials, websites and other information presented by professional growers to help the novice become a master. </p><p>But then again, those types of resources are available for everything from changing the oil in a vehicle to replacing the thermostat in the living room. Still, most people rely on the professionals. </p><p>Home cannabis cultivation, much like home brewing, will never be a way of life that threatens to put an entire industry out of commission. Nope, most Americans don’t have any interest in becoming cannabis farmers, even though <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/is-a-weed-growing-kit-worth-the-money" target="_blank">grow kits</a> have made it a bit easier.</p><p>And if you are looking for a little motivation to grow your own, just see what <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-dank-duchess-on-the-beauty-of-hashish" target="_blank">The Dank Duchess</a> had to say about getting starting with home cannabis cultivation.</p><p>&#34;There is no data to suggest that lawful home cultivation would lead to a mass of people growing at home,” Strekal says.</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>Cooking with Cannabis: Infused Empanada de Yuca&#xA;con Queso y Manzana Ahumado</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/cooking-with-cannabis-infused-empanada-de-yuca-con-queso-y-manzana-ahumado-01fn7a6yvcap?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Sara Kamber</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fn7a6yvcap</guid><description>Learn how to make homemade empanadas from yuca.

In the United States, approximately 10 percent of the adult population has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder in the past 12 months. <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/newsroom/news-releases/psychedelic-treatment-with-psilocybin-relieves-major-depression-study-shows"><u>The National Institute of Mental Health</u></a> reports that more than 17 million people in the U.S. have experienced major depression.</p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic has only made things worse.</p><p>Months of people experiencing fear of either getting or spreading the virus, coupled with job losses and entertainment venue closures, people being forced to accept working from home, and the end of many forms of social interaction, could all contribute to a wild burst of cases of depression not just in the U.S. but around the world.</p><p>History proves that overwhelming, uncontrollable events similar to the current pandemic can lead to greater numbers of people dealing with depression. </p><p>For example, in 2010, after the 2008 market crash and subsequent layoffs, there were 1.5 million more people treated for major depression than in 2005, according to the <a href="https://www.psychiatrist.com/JCP/article/Pages/economic-burden-adults-major-depressive-disorder-united.aspx"><u><em>Journal of Clinical</em></u><u> </u><u><em>Psychiatry</em></u></a>. </p><p>What’s more, the typical pharmaceutical options for treatment of depression, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/ssris/art-20044825"><u>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</u></a> (Prozac, Zoloft and Paxil), and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/antidepressants/art-20046983"><u>tricyclic antidepressants</u></a> (Norpramin, Tofranil and Pamelor), require daily administration and carry with them undesirable mental and physical side effects.</p><h2><strong>Psilocybin Therapy for Depression: Studies</strong></h2><p>Research using <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/a-guide-to-your-first-magic-mushroom-trip" target="_blank">psilocybin therapy</a> for treatment of depression is demonstrating that this natural psychedelic could be an effective remedy to help deal with depression. It can help people not just live with their depression, but even overcome it.</p><p>Studies are proving that psychedelic therapy can provide long-lasting help for patients with severe and, in some cases, untreatable depression. Researchers are discovering that patients can stay in total remission of their depression for at least four years – or longer.</p><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7643046/"><u>A recent randomized clinical trial of 24 adult participants</u></a> at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland, found that psilocybin administered in the context of supportive psychotherapy produced “large, rapid, and sustained antidepressant effects.” </p><p>These effects were “approximately 2.5 times greater than the effect sizes found in psychotherapy alone, and more than four times greater than the effect sizes found in psychopharmacological depression treatment studies,” according to findings from the trial.</p><p>“This is not just a powerful treatment,” Alan Davis says, speaking at the Psychedelic 2020 Summit in September. Davis is the assistant professor of social work at Ohio State University, and an adjunct assistant professor in the Psychedelic Research Unit at Johns Hopkins University. He led a team of seven other researchers in the study. “But this psilocybin therapy blows other treatments out of the water.”<br/><br/></p><p>This was the first controlled study of psilocybin therapy in the broader population of major depression patients, Davis says. </p><p>Researchers recruited people with a long-term documented history of depression, most of whom experienced persisting symptoms for approximately two years before enrolling in the study. The average age of participants was 39; 16 of whom were women; and 22 identified themselves as white, one person identified as Asian and one person identified as African American.</p><h3><strong>How the Study was Conducted</strong></h3><p>Thirteen participants received the psilocybin treatment immediately after recruitment and after preparation sessions, and 11 participants received the same preparation and treatment after an eight-week delay.</p><p>Treatment consisted of two psilocybin doses given by two clinical monitors who provided guidance and reassurance. </p><p>The doses were given two weeks apart between August 2017 and April 2019 at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center Behavioral Biology Research Building. </p><p>Each treatment session lasted approximately five hours, with the participant lying on a couch wearing eyeshades and headphones that played music, in the presence of the monitors.</p><p>Findings from the study suggest that psilocybin may be effective in the much wider population of patients who suffer from major depression than previously appreciated.</p><p>Researchers in the study reported that the usual pharmacological drugs to treat depression have limited efficacy, and produce adverse effects: “Although many patients with depression showed reduced or remitted symptoms after treatment with existing pharmacotherapies, approximately 30 percent to 50 percent of patients did not respond fully and as many as 10 percent to 30 percent of patients were considered treatment-resistant.”</p><h2><strong>Results on PsilocybinTreatment for Depression</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/plt/dataimagejpegbase649j4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD2wCEAA-a2e64d83140f5050d807d2ff3fdd8098.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption>Why have magic mushrooms been illegal for so long?</figcaption></figure><p>What the research team discovered is that the positive effects of psilocybin on depression lasted at least four weeks for most of the participants. Other than a few headaches, most participants reported no side effects from their doses.</p><p>Depression decreased immediately after the first psilocybin session, Davis says. “Depression reduced quickly and remained low.” What researchers saw was that anxiety was also reduced, and thoughts of suicide as well. They found that two-thirds of the group had, after just one week, a positive clinical response.</p><p>A total of 58 percent of participants were considered in complete remission for up to a year. “Keep in mind that these were people who on average had been depressed for decades with little or no help from traditional antidepressants or psychotherapy,” Davis says. “That psilocybin therapy produced such a strong change was exciting for them on a personal level. And for us on an investigative trial level.”</p><p>Researchers also found that the greater the intensity of the mystical experience that comes from psilocybin, the more the decrease in depression. “We found an even stronger relationship between psychological insight gained during the psychedelic experience and changes in depression,” he says. “The more intense they got – the awareness and realizations and discoveries about their life – correlated strongly with a decrease in depression.</p><p>“This tells us that mystical-type and psychological experiences were really robust, and that perhaps when they have these mystical and insight experiences, it could produce change in their traumatic experience or in the resolution of trauma.” </p><p>Regarding long-term outcomes, the drop in depression overall lasted up to 12 months. “Some relapsed. But as a whole, their depression was less,” Davis says. “Even if the depression came back, it came back to a less intense degree than it was before. There are certainly more studies that need to be done.”</p><p><strong>Remarkable Improvements in Quality of Life</strong></p><p>Matthew Johnson, professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who also worked on the study, says this period of remission from depression is really unprecedented.</p><p> “It was just astonishing,” he says. “It’s not the drug strength. It was the experience, what you went through, that had some relationship to these long term outcomes. We are in our infancy. We have a lot to figure out. This is a psychological intervention. It’s just not hitting neurons and treating symptoms. And that is the key here.”</p><p>Johnson, who is also the <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/0800020/matthew-johnson"><u>president of the International Society for Research on Psychedelics</u></a>, an organization he founded with colleagues, also discussed his earlier work in psilocybin. </p><p>People reported remarkable improvements in mood and quality of life over a year after their sessions. “It wasn’t just them, but community observers, like spouses and friends that volunteered to provide responses about the participant in the study, who said that this person seems different.”</p><p>Another study he worked on was the first study to show that a laboratory experience actually changed a personality dimension. “The definition of personality is that it’s supposed to be stable. You may see changes over major life events, but certainly nothing that you can experimentally manipulate – until this finding,” Johnson says.</p><p>With psilocybin therapy, he says that researchers found an increase in openness, or a tolerance for other people’s views and thinking in a “both-and” rather than an “either-or” framework. Plus, an appreciation for aesthetics. “This was increased with psilocybin if you had the full mystical experience.”</p><h2><strong>More Proof of Long-Lasting, Helpful Effects</strong></h2><p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881119897615?journalCode=jopa&amp;"><u>A follow- up related study</u></a> about cancer and depression was conducted by Gabrielle Agin-Liebes, a clinical psychologist working on the clinical application of psilocybin therapy at Palo Alto University in early 2020. She discussed long-term follow-up research about cancer diagnosis and depression during the Psilocybin 2020 Summit. “Diagnosis of an illness like cancer can create extreme despair and existential distress,” she says.<br/><br/></p><p>Participants had done three sessions of psychotherapy and psilocybin in the parent study, and she tracked them in her follow-up report. “The outcomes appear to persist,” she says. “Three years to four-and-half years later, participants report that their anxiety reductions remain. Also their depression remission rates remained very high, at about 60-80 percent.”</p><p>All participants remarked on the persistent effects of the psilocybin therapy as either the single most or among the top five most important personal experiences of their life. Her follow-up study found that people continued to get better over time, and that the effects of the therapy got stronger.</p><h3><strong>Finding an Emotional Catharsis</strong></h3><p>Other papers Agin-Liebes worked on involved interviews of cancer patients with depression who describe an “emotional catharsis” after psilocybin therapy, with some reporting that they were able to come to terms with their cancer and find new meaning in their lives. </p><p>“There are some compelling theories about what is happening here,” she says. “What I find most interesting is the acceptance of the experience. Instead of trying to control their emotions, they let go and accept the experience.”</p><p>People also described a greater sense of themselves, she says.</p><h2><strong>Getting Psychedelics into Mainstream Medicine</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/plt/dataimagejpegbase649j4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAAQABAAD2wCEAA-cc1d033ee1345652705cea0bf0e8a191.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption>If you don't believe fungi can help save the world, maybe you ought to learn more about fungi.</figcaption></figure><p>As these studies continue, there are new and novel methods of getting the experience of psilocybin therapy into the general population. One of those new ideas comes from <a href="https://www.pharmather.com/"><u>PharmaTher Inc.</u></a>, a specialty life sciences company focused on the research and development of psychedelic pharmaceuticals for depression and pain. </p><p>The company recently announced the filing of a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office outlining the potential for novel combinations of psilocybin and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs to treat neurological disorders.</p><p><a href="https://cbd.cookies.store/collections/caps-by-cookies"><u>Another supplement product</u></a> combines non-psychoactive psychedelic mushrooms with cannabinoids and terpenes to create various wake and sleep experiences.</p><p>There is more movement on <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Measure_109,_Psilocybin_Mushroom_Services_Program_Initiative_(2020)"><u>legalization</u></a> and/or <a href="https://decrimnaturedc.org/"><u>decriminalization</u></a> of psilocybin gaining traction <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/three-states-introduce-new-bills-for-expanded-psilocybin-therapy" target="_blank">across the U.S.</a> and in other countries. </p><p>Getting psilocybin and other <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/psychedelics-for-mental-health" target="_blank">psychedelic medicines into the medical mainstream</a>, and using them to work on something as profound and life-changing as managing or possibly even curing depression – psilocybin as a proven game-changer for treating depression has gained serious momentum.</p><h2><strong>The Future of Psychedelics Therapy</strong></h2><p>“This field is blowing up,” Johnson says. “Psychedelics therapy could be brought to bear on a lot of therapeutic behavior change. But we need some wisdom. Some say the medicalization is completely ridiculous. We would do best to avoid all of these extremes and evaluate efforts by their own merits by individual actors. It’s not just for hippies or new age-y folks.” </p><p>He says that he has seen too many grandmas benefit from taking psychedelics for depression which has made him a believer in its efficacy. “You name it, I have seen experiences where people have had dramatic positive transformations in their life that don’t fit the usual treatment model. This is not just for people that are into hippie culture. This is about meaning for human beings.”</p><p><strong>Are you still missing out on The Bluntness newsletter? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> today to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>psilocybin</category></item><item><title>Does Weed Cause False Romantic Feelings?</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/does-weed-cause-false-romantic-feelings?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Mike Adams</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fmj814wpcv</guid><description>Ask anyone who has ever smoked marijuana with a partner, and they’ll undoubtedly testify to its bizarre power to bring an element of togetherness. </description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 12:22:43 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1920,h_1080,x_0,y_4/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fn3sahyepv77bnjen5.jpg" caption="Does weed enhance relationships or no? | Photo by Alex Iby on Unsplash"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Mike Adams"></flatplan:author><keywords>Marijuana,cannabis,Relationship,The Bluntness,weed,evergreen</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been said that the couple that smokes together stays together. There’s a legend perpetuated among the cannabis community suggesting that two people can have a more meaningful, successful relationship if they embrace a stoned union. </p><p>Those who buy into this ethos believe that weed narrows the connectional divide, both emotionally and sexually, and helps forge an intimacy that non-users would never be able to conceptualize, not in a million years. But is the closeness that two people experience while ripped on reefer indicative of their undying bond or does being high really just dampen the realities of a relationship and cause false feelings?</p><p>Ask anyone who has ever smoked marijuana with a partner, and they’ll undoubtedly testify to its bizarre power to bring an element of togetherness to the relationship. It can make movie night more fun, dinners out a heck of a lot more interesting, and it definitely seems to help couples achieve more <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/cannasexual-ashley-manta"><u>profound leaps in the bedroom</u></a>. <em>Rowr!</em> </p><p>For some, however, a reefer romance is simply a way to brave the intricacies of this wild world without allowing the soul-sucking saboteurs that exist in every relationship – money, sexual conflict, pet peeves -- to gain the upper hand.  </p><h2><strong>Connecting with Cannabis?</strong></h2><p>“My wife and I have been together for nine years and we’ve stayed high together the whole time,” Jason, a 37-year-old from Denver, Colorado, told <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/"><u>The Bluntness</u></a>. “It definitely brings peace to each of us separately and together. We are very happy when we can both get high. It strengthened our relationship!”</p><p>Some cannabis users argue that tandem toking has allowed them to resurrect from the ashes of their damaged pasts, let their guards down and move forward with healthier relationships. “My fiancé and I have come to understand that we’re just tighter when we smoke,” 32-year-old Marcus told us. “We both come from unhealthy, really toxic relationships. Marijuana connects us and helps us be more comfortable with each other than we could ever accomplish being sober.”</p><p>Now that marijuana is legal in over half the nation, it is easy for more couples to get their hands on it. This allows those seemingly bonded by bud to relish in medicated monogamy or pothead polyamory (if you’re into that sort of thing) until their high hearts are content. But for those still living in areas of prohibition, the quest to keep their relationship on a high can prove challenging. </p><p>“We started our relationship smoking together constantly,” says Mick, a 34-year-old from Nashville, Tennessee. “But when we were out, things would get quiet, and it was frustrating because we didn’t have anything to talk about. I was starting to think we weren’t going to make it.”</p><p>Indeed, relationships are sometimes rife for ruins after one or both partners stop using. This can happen for various reasons: Individuals can be forced to put the pot behind them because of a job where cannabis is banned as part of a drug-free workplace. Marijuana-related convictions with a probationary term can also be a sobering time for a couple. It could also be that they can’t afford it anymore and need to cut back to keep food on the table. Or maybe they just decided that being high every day is no longer conducive to a productive future, and they want to quit. </p><p>Whatever the reason, the drought of the doobie or sudden obligation to total abstinence can put a real savage strain on a relationship. </p><p>“My husband and I had to stop smoking for our jobs,” explains Kathy, a 42-year-old factory worker from Mason, Ohio. “Things just aren’t the same as they once were. Neither of us are happy.”</p><p>Yikes!</p><h2><strong>Is Weed Really a Critical Ingredient to Healthy Relationships?</strong></h2><p>Is it possible that the happiness couples experience with marijuana can be stripped away in an instant once they get sober? </p><p>We reached out to <a href="https://www.weinerphd.com/"><u>Dr. Aaron Weiner</u></a>, licensed board-certified clinical psychologist, and master addiction counselor to get some answers. Although he admits it is unlikely that a couple’s marijuana use will produce feelings that they would not have without pot, there is always the possibility for these love affairs to hit a snag once marijuana is no longer a common denominator. So, more than anything, he says, being on the same page goes a long way. </p><p>“The most important factor in couples&#39; closeness related to marijuana use is that their values and habits related to cannabis are similar,” Dr. Weiner explained to The Bluntness. “Smoking marijuana itself does not necessarily have either a positive or negative impact on the relationship - it&#39;s about whether the couple is in agreement on the role cannabis has in their lives.”</p><p>When getting stoned is part of a person’s mantra, the doctor believes it is best that they partner with someone who shares in this enthusiasm. Otherwise, the relationship could be strained. </p><p>“If one person likes to smoke but their smoking really bothers their partner, that creates tension in the relationship until either their beliefs or their behaviors become aligned again,” said Dr. Weiner. “Opposites don&#39;t really attract - we like to be similar to our friends and partners.”</p><p>That’s not to say it’s impossible for two people to make a relationship work if one smokes pot and the other doesn’t. At least according to Theresa, a 38-year-old concert promoter from St. Taunton, Massachusetts. “My husband does not smoke but I do,” she said. “We get along just fine. He is completely sober. What works for some may not work for others. I do have my medical card and had for a number of years prior to meeting my husband. It does not bother him at all.”</p><p>Nevertheless, most cannabis users agree that marijuana is better when shared with a companion. Hey, they don’t call them joints for nothing. But many refuse to credit weed for the ability to connect with a partner. “I don’t think weed has anything to do with that,” said Alicia from Houston, Texas. “If you have to smoke pot in order to feel connected, then cannabis is not the issue.”</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>Marijuana</category></item><item><title>Pssst...

If you’re a dedicated cannabis consumer, one of the most important things for you to know is how to get free weed.</p><p>From dispensary freebies to brand samples, there are several different ways to get creative about amassing some free weed – especially if you live in a legal state like California, Washington, or Colorado. </p><p>However, there are equal cannabis opportunities to be had throughout the country (if you look hard enough). </p><h2><strong>Dispensary Freebies</strong></h2><p>The easiest way to get free weed usually comes your way with little effort on your part – just visit a dispensary! Most dispensaries offer deals for first-time patients or customers, so if you’re new to the spot, you can almost guarantee you’ll get a little something to sweeten the deal. </p><p>From a free house joint to getting bumped up on the scale to winning free smoking accessories, there are several different ways to win big at a dispensary, but it depends on the location. Make sure to do your research before you go on your next weed run – if you shop smart and sign up for dispensary email lists, you can really maximize your return.</p><p>In fact, even if you’re not a first-time customer, most dispensaries will still offer opportunities for you to come away with a little treat. Some spots provide punch cards to patients, which guarantees a special prize after X amount of visits to the clinic. Others offer referral prizes for bringing any new patients to the location. There really are tons of options to come up on some good deals, for seasoned cannabis enthusiasts and newbies alike. </p><h2><strong>Free Cannabis for Veterans and Those with Disabilities</strong></h2><p>Michigan is the state to watch for setting the standard for cannabis COVID relief. Back in April 2020, a group of cannabis business owners and advocates in Montcalm County banded together to <a href="https://www.woodtv.com/health/coronavirus/right-thing-to-do-free-marijuana-for-vets-people-with-disabilities/"><u>provide some aid</u></a> to veterans and/or people with disabilities. </p><p>Any Montcalm County resident who can prove they served in the military or are on Social Security disability gets a free quarter-ounce of flower, some edibles, and various hemp products that altogether would retail around $150. </p><p>This has been a weekly event since the start of the pandemic. These activists aim to spread awareness and help out those in need during a time where many people have lost their jobs, and therefore access to medical cannabis. </p><h2><strong>Cannabis Compassion Programs</strong></h2><p>Pandemic aside, sometimes we find ourselves down on our luck and struggling financially from time to time. Luckily, many legal states are aware of this and have developed cannabis compassion programs to help out those in need.</p><p>Dispensary 33 in Chicago launched their <a href="https://dispensary33.com/cannabis-compassion-program/"><u>program</u></a>, which allows for anyone in need to apply for six months of free cannabis assistance. You’re eligible to apply for the program as long as you’re currently receiving need-based government assistance, and registered as a Dispensary 33 patient for at least 120 days. </p><p>People are able to apply twice a year. If approved, you’ll receive $240 worth of store credit each month for a total of six months.</p><p><a href="http://weedforgood.org/"><u>Weed for Good</u></a> is another cannabis compassion program that aims to help those in financial distress. The program targets anyone with chronic or terminal illnesses who uses medical cannabis as a form of relief and/or medicine.</p><p>Berkeley’s <a href="https://www.mybpg.com/services/helping-hands"><u>Helping Hands</u></a>, a needs-based cannabis program for Berkeley residents, is another great opportunity for those in need of financial assistance. The program began in 1999 and offers patients two free eighths of cannabis per week.</p><p>If you’re a Canadian resident in need of some assistance, <a href="https://cannalabedibles.ca/rso-program/"><u>Cannalab</u></a> might be able to help. The brand has created a program to help medical cannabis patients who cannot afford their medicine. The brand commits 5 percent of its sales to the program, which provides patients with regular Rick Simpson oil (RSO) treatments. </p><h2><strong>Research for Free Cannabis</strong></h2><p>With cannabis still illegal on a federal level, there remains a ton of research that still needs to be done on the plant’s effects. If you support the scientific research that goes into the cannabis plant and want to be part of it, you can – and you might also score some free product in the process.</p><p>The University of Kentucky is looking for cannabis research opportunities, studying the effects of cannabis on young users. As long as you are 18-34 years of age and use cannabis, you are eligible to <a href="https://www.ccts.uky.edu/participate-research/current-studies/cannabis-research-opportunities"><u>apply</u></a> for an interview. UCLA is also <a href="https://cannabis.semel.ucla.edu/"><u>regularly looking</u></a> for research volunteers, as is <a href="https://www.altasciences.com/participant"><u>Alta Sciences</u></a> (and they also pay their participants). </p><h2><strong>Cannabis Giveaways</strong></h2><p>Another great way to score some free weed is to keep an eye on cannabis giveaways. Just like any industry, cannabis brands and businesses have to give away a fair amount of their product to garner interest, so take advantage of this as much as you can. From brands’ Instagram giveaways to a simple google search, there are plenty of opportunities to snag online.</p><p>Additionally, companies like <a href="https://www.seed-city.com/free-seed-giveaways?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=3efa68b7bee05aa7626281eae1566e4bf26efa32-1611523647-0-Afdy8il2wAKbmy8uJYjQNmO8U7qNFro3evg973eqQrPY8upDLbe60tlHQSqVR1LHEVVC2e16ubBuG9K9LWeRgc1mUi3G_egRVBYdY2gstLoWeorzeBm1bp_32rvZcKnhi9rBUkvDFy36SB1bsjXFVC6Y4FgyqNq1SNOdhwEDYnnbkPE7uhU7TBF8u3b7Tj8vfKRbVEvQav7BWPFd8i_vbBKEldWcRMtKo4jUeJO3vIKppbcdLrFaXSPaeYn6ygr0c-z1NtTrD865E6VeyDsY_1wWqdcuVSCTwTGU5Jo9Ipk3cxSBEBddF-ytWm5LFgmjOFcJOIfkTQoqzM7tDJa3TzE"><u>Seed City</u></a> and <a href="http://hilohempseed.com/million-hemp-seed-giveaway/"><u>HiLo</u></a> have ongoing giveaways you can easily apply for online. CBD brand Blue Spruce does a <a href="https://bluesprucecbd.com/pages/giveaway2020"><u>yearly giveaway</u></a> that leaves one lucky winner with a year’s supply of product, and <a href="https://www.hellobatch.com/free-cbd-oil-sample/"><u>BATCH</u></a>, which has recently rebranded, is offering free samples of CBD – as long as you cover the $4 shipping fee. </p><h2><strong>Remember to Always Practice Safety</strong></h2><p>These deals are just the tip of the iceberg, but now that you know where and how to look, the free weed opportunities you’ll begin to come across will surprise you.</p><p>Although obtaining free weed is one of life’s simplest pleasures, it’s important to always practice caution when accepting a complimentary treat. When accepting a free offer, always make sure the packaging is unopened and adheres to all <a href="https://mass-cannabis-control.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/111717CannabisPackagingandLabelingRegulatoryRecommendationsforStates.pdf"><u>cannabis labeling regulations</u></a>. This guarantees that your product was fully tested and deemed safe for consumption. </p><p>Additionally, make sure to always stick with trusted dispensaries and/or brands that you know and love. While free weed always sounds great, if you believe your product has been tampered with in any way, it just isn’t worth the risk. </p><p>Stay safe, and happy bargaining!</p><p><strong>Are you still missing out on The Bluntness newsletter? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> today to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>High on Feminism Podcast Brings Women in Cannabis to the Forefront</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/high-talks-podcast?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Taylor Engle</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fmt5x2xtr7</guid><description>High on Feminism podcast producer and host Jess Poulin sits down with The Bluntness for some candid insights about the cannabis industry today.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:07:07 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/plt/high_talks__episode_1-ae2780e1db812ac2fbd258176f051b81.jpg" caption="High Talks: Episode 1 | Woke Media"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Taylor Engle"></flatplan:author><keywords>cannabis,INDUSTRY,cannabis Industry,legal cannabis,legal,women,podcasting,evergreen</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The legal cannabis industry is becoming increasingly aware of its moral obligation to true equity across the market – passing the microphone to operators who’ve been fundamental to cannabis’s growth, yet shut out of the legal market. </p><p>This is where cannabis media can come into play: cannabis bloggers, podcast hosts, and influencers have tremendous sway over what’s talked about in the industry, and some are beginning to really take this responsibility to heart. </p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPy_u_x65UA&amp;t=5s"><u><em>High Talks</em></u></a>, a cannabis-specific series from the creators of the <a href="http://www.instagram.com/highonfeminism"><u><em>High On Feminism</em></u></a> (HOF) podcast, is a <a href="https://wokemediahouse.com/"><u>Woke Media</u></a> platform advocating for equity and social justice through their coverage, which includes educational conversations with those in the industry – specifically women – about cannabis from a business, legislative, and reformative perspective. </p><h2><strong>Cannabis Has Long Been a Boy’s Club – But Not Anymore</strong></h2><p>The first episode of <em>High On Feminism’s </em>new panel series, <em>High Talks</em>, kept its promise by shining the spotlight on women in cannabis. </p><p>The episode’s panel, which was hosted by <em>High On Feminism </em>producer Jess Poulin, included <a href="https://www.herhighness.com/"><u>Her Highness NYC</u></a> co-founder Laura Eisman, <a href="https://www.lastprisonerproject.org/"><u>Last Prisoner Project</u></a> community engagement manager and formerly incarcerated mother Evelyn LaChappelle, and <a href="https://www.highherstory.com/"><u>High Herstory</u></a> co-founder Annette Mia Flores. </p><p>The women discuss LaChappelle’s charges that led to an 87-month sentencing, cannabis legislature and prison reform, and how women can support other women and mothers who are still incarcerated for petty cannabis crimes. </p><p>“When it comes absolutely everything in life, [women] are always forgotten about,” Poulin told <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/"><u><em>The Bluntness</em></u></a><em>.</em></p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_3024,h_1701,x_0,y_1030/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fn6mxskykxf5tybwa0.png" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of Woke Media."><figcaption>TT The Artist (left) and Jess Poulin (right) recording a Woke Media podcast together. | Image courtesy of Woke Media.</figcaption></figure><p>“As legislation changes around cannabis, it’s crucial to remember that women are part of this as well. We’ve always been intelligent, resourceful entrepreneurs, and we also want to smoke. Weed isn’t just for men, even if that’s how it’s always portrayed in pop culture.”</p><p>Poulin’s goals in the industry center on the advancement of women in cannabis – especially women of color. While the industry has been geared towards men for decades, entrepreneurs like Poulin are working to ensure this isn’t the standard moving forward. </p><p>“It’s so exciting. We’re working with pre-roll and bong companies, creating these really sleek, sexy, aesthetic products – things you’d actually want displayed in your home,” Poulin said. </p><p>Women have had a strong influence on the cannabis community for several centuries, utilizing the plant to take care of their families spiritually and medicinally. But after prohibition hit and cannabis was forced to exist solely underground, these rituals were largely forgotten, along with the women who upheld them. </p><p>As Poulin attempts to shed light on women in cannabis today, she also recognizes that if other women aren’t on the same page, nothing will change.</p><p>“Women don&#39;t support each other enough. We’re getting better, but there’s still a lot of work women need to do amongst ourselves when it comes to supporting one another,” Poulin said. </p><p>“I don’t claim to be the most knowledgeable person about cannabis, but I love to continue learning about it through my work. I’m having fun taking in new information and uplifting other women along the way.”</p><p>This is how the cannabis industry – and all industries – can truly shift their mindset in regards to women in the field: by allowing women the space to share their perspectives, innovate, and encourage one another.</p><h2><strong>Normalizing Women and Weed: From Consumer to CEO</strong></h2><p>Although it’s important to accept women into the cannabis industry, it’s equally important to allow women to find their place within the cannabis community: a.k.a., the consumer side.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, women have long had their hands in cannabis and how it’s grown, distributed, and utilized by cultures all over the world. However, much of today’s media reflects a bro-centric weed culture, which simply isn’t the case.</p><p>“With <em>High Talks</em>, I want to start breaking down the taboos around cannabis in real life. Being able to talk about it more openly with your family, smoking around aunts and uncles and breaking that stigma of, if you smoke weed, you’re just a lazy stoner sitting on the couch watching movies,” Poulin said. </p><p>“If you educate yourself on cannabis’s effects and understand your body and how the plant works with it, you can find a form of it that really balances and seamlessly blends into your life. That’s amazing, and more people need to know about it.”</p><p>Cannabis has faced a big enough stigma over the past several decades, and women in cannabis are hit with that stigma ten times over. Since women are typically expected to “behave” in all aspects of society, a woman being associated with this rebellion-based plant has been a major taboo – and advocates like Poulin are working to change that. </p><p>“The <em>High Talks </em>series is going to highlight women in cannabis: everything from female entrepreneurs and how to build a cannabis brand to women in prison and the continued need for expungement,” Poulin said. </p><p>“I want to bring stuff like this to the forefront. Why are people still behind bars? Who are the people fighting to get remaining legalizations through in the U.S.? What can we do as  consumers to ensure that, if states are legalizing cannabis, they’re also letting currently-incarcerated people out?”</p><p>Poulin is currently in the process of planning Season 2 of <em>High on Feminism</em>, after receiving a wealth of raving reviews for the first season, and is aiming to share new episodes of <em>High Talks </em>every other month. She aims to continue elevating women- and Black-owned cannabis businesses, creating a much-needed platform for businesswomen across the country.</p><p>“When I was starting my company, I was in a lot of rooms where I was the only woman, the only Black person, or the only Black woman in the room. That can be really intimidating, when that’s what everyone is paying attention to,” Poulin said. </p><p>“<em>High on Feminism</em> is about giving women a bigger platform. There’s so many ideas of what a woman can be, but a lot of times, we feel like we’re forced to choose between mom, housewife, or businesswoman. You can actually be all three, and it’s important to show young girls and women in their 20s and 30s what that can look like for them.”</p><p>As for New York legislation and the continued legalization of cannabis throughout the country, Poulin will continue to use <em>High Talks </em>to shine the spotlight on those who are still incarcerated for cannabis, despite these legal advancements.</p><p>“Back in the ’90s and early 2000s, you could get arrested for having a small joint on you. The fact that many of these people are still sitting behind bars and I probably have more weed in my house right now than what they had on them...I don’t want to see anything about business until these people are out of prison,” Poulin said.</p><p>Podcasts like <em>High on Feminism, </em>with programming like <em>High Talks </em>and advocates like Poulin are great models for what the industry needs to remain focused on: equity, expungement, and a return to cannabis’s spiritual roots.</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>Fear &amp; Loathing in Maine: Feds Over-Encroaching on State Cannabis Program?</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/maine-federal-cannabis-charges?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Gregory Frye</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fmwa6nxrbd</guid><description>Lucas Sirois was among 11 defendants to plead not guilty to federal charges in a case the whole cannabis industry needs to follow.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 14:50:02 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_5200,h_2925,x_0,y_477/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fmwajxw3f2ent2cpjs.jpg" caption="Pay careful attention, cannabis industry stakeholders – this could happen to you."></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Gregory Frye"></flatplan:author><keywords>news,cannabis industry,cannabis law,medical cannabis,Maine</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nov. 19, 2021 -- Eleven defendants pleaded not guilty Thursday in a federal case out of Maine, which the whole U.S. cannabis industry ought to be watching.</p><p>Among the defendants is Lucas Sirois, a former cannabis caregiver, who has been accused of spearheading the illicit sale of more than $13 million in cannabis over a period of six years.</p><p>As reported in the <a href="https://www.pressherald.com/2021/11/18/seven-of-11-defendants-indicted-on-nov-9-plead-not-guilty-to-charges-in-a-marijuana-money-laundering-conspiracy/"><u>Press Herald</u></a>, Sirois plead not guilty to a range of “conspiracy” charges, including conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance, conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and conspiracy to defraud the United States and impede and impair the Internal Revenue Services.</p><p>The not guilty plea comes 16 months after the feds initially disrupted Sirois’s Farmington-based operation and took property, cash, computers, vehicles – even Sirois’s right to use medical cannabis, while he has to wait and see how his fate will play out.</p><p>Pay careful attention, cannabis industry stakeholders – this could happen to you.</p><h2><strong>A Chilling Effect on the Cannabis Industry</strong></h2><p>Magistrate Judge John Nivison has set a trial date for the January 2022 term, however Sirois’s defense team plans “to pursue a preliminary injunction in the form of a Rohrbacher-Farr challenge to stop the prosecution,” attorney Eric Postow of Parlatore Law Group told <a href="http://www.thebluntness.com"><u><em>The Bluntness</em></u></a>.</p><p>Postow, who is assisting attorney Timothy Parlatore on the case, emphasized how the Rohrbacher-Farr amendment prevents the DOJ from spending any funds to prosecute a state-legal medicinal cannabis business that is compliant with state laws. </p><p>“The facts of this case strongly demonstrate that our client was acting in compliance with Maine&#39;s laws and should therefore not be prosecuted,” Postow said.</p><p>“As far as importance, the DOJ&#39;s efforts here are directly chilling the legal cannabis industry by over-broad and selective enforcement in the ways that Rohrbacher-Farr was written to prevent.”</p><h2><strong>Everyone in Cannabis is at Risk</strong></h2><p>Essentially, if the Feds win this case, it could open the gates for them to go after other state-legal operators. If Sirois wins this case, it will send a clear message to federal agencies still trying to police this herbal plant: back off.</p><p>The whole point of the Rohrbacher-Farr amendment is to prevent federal interference while states figure out their cannabis programs.</p><p>Because cannabis is a schedule one controlled substance, technically everyone in the industry – both plant-touching and ancillary businesses – is breaking federal law.</p><p>(By the way, if you’re not familiar with how cannabis originally became a Schedule I controlled substance, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/how-cannabis-became-schedule-I" target="_blank"><u>read this article and prepare yourself for a shock</u></a>.)</p><p>And with state regulations constantly changing and evolving, the risk is further compounded for all operators.</p><p>How is an industry voted in by people at the state level supposed to thrive if the feds disrupt progress, taking people’s property and threatening with life in prison?</p><p>As Postow explains, even if you think you’re running an airtight operation, the risk is still there. </p><p>Suppose you’re a licensed state operator and you legally sell a shipment of cannabis. If the buyer does something illegal with it, the federal government could possibly take it all the way back to you.</p><p>“All the way down the chain, if you open it up like that, so broadly, everybody in cannabis is at risk. That’s the issue here,” Postow said. </p><p>“They&#39;re so far removed from the licensed business operations that anyone that you touch, any relationship, anyone you talk to, if they are doing something illegal with cannabis, the federal government is going to be able to tie them to you or are going to try to tie them to you – and through tying them to you, they’re going to attack you.”</p><h2><strong>The Feds Picked the Wrong Guy</strong></h2><p>Postow is quite confident about the Sirois case, that the facts show Sirois’s operation was compliant with state law, and the federal government has over-encroached on a state program.</p><p>“As soon as the federal government put out their complaint, it was clear that our client and his business are not the bad guys. The true story here is that the federal government is the bad guy in this narrative,” Postow said. </p><p>“The federal government is the bad guy when it comes to attacking legal business, folks that are trying to do everything right under their state laws to bring themselves up, entrepreneurs with this threat of a lurching federal government right on their back, that essentially says, ‘if there&#39;s any slip-up anywhere in the universe that you&#39;re in, we&#39;re going to tie those people to you, we&#39;re going to make you part of this broad conspiracy, and we&#39;re going to shut you down.”</p><p>Not only had Sirois’s licensed operation passed multiple compliance audits, but Sirois was also an advocate for more robust tracking and tracing systems, working with regulators and policymakers to create tighter measures to prevent things from slipping, Postow said.</p><p>“Does that sound like someone who wants to do things illegally, if he&#39;s advocating for them to watch him more closely? No, because quite frankly, they picked the absolute wrong guy here.”</p><p>Luke Sirois didn’t come from money, Postow continued. “He&#39;s not the Wall Street guy; he&#39;s not the Ivy League school, Brooks Brothers suit CEO. He&#39;s a guy that found his chance with a plant that he understood, and when it became legal, he seized his opportunity to pull himself up, and he brought himself up and he brought his family up, and that&#39;s what the federal government wants to attack. They&#39;re going after blue collar working  people, they&#39;re going after the little guy, people that finally have their chance and they make it, that&#39;s who they&#39;re attacking,” he said. </p><p>“We have multi-state, billion-dollar marijuana businesses right now, and you hardly hear about them. It&#39;s the regular people that they go after because they think they&#39;re unsophisticated and they won&#39;t fight back, and they won&#39;t make a stink. Luke’s not that guy. He&#39;s a fighter, and we&#39;re going to fight this thing in every way possible, because it&#39;s wrong. What they&#39;re doing is wrong, and everybody knows it.”</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>news</category></item><item><title>Reefer Scare Tactics: Is This a Cannabis Apocalypse?</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/reefer-scare-tactics-is-this-a-cannabis-apocalypse?utm_source=RSS</link><author>David Hodes</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fmmmnq67q8</guid><description>Cannabis dispensaries qualify as “essential businesses” in most states where it has been legalized, yet willful disinformation against the plant continues.</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 13:33:00 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_4500,h_2531,x_0,y_894/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fmsk223gg1ebjxa33h.jpg" caption="Cannabis is more accepted than ever -- yet willful disinformation is ramping up.

Doubts about people accepting this new industry have faded. A <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/04/16/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-recreational-or-medical-use/"><u>Pew survey</u></a> in April showed that 91 percent of American adults agree that marijuana should be legalized for medical or adult-use.</p><p>Nothing, it seems, can stop this multi-billion dollar juggernaut even as it struggles to gain true business operability as a purveyor of what the Federal government says is a prohibited narcotic.</p><p>But recently, as legal cannabis businesses open in more states (<a href="https://norml.org/laws/legalization/"><u>19 at last count</u></a>, plus Guam and the District of Columbia), there appears to be forces at work attempting to derail the industry.</p><p>Yes, there are a few glimmers of hope that the Feds may be softening their stance ever so slightly on cannabis by <a href="https://www.dea.gov/stories/2021/2021-05/2021-05-14/dea-continues-prioritize-efforts-expand-access-marijuana-research"><u>allowing more medical cannabis grow operations</u></a>.</p><p>And yes, bills in Congress about <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/subjects/cannabis/1766#text=Marijuana&amp;sort=relevance&amp;terms=__ALL__&amp;terms2=__ALL__"><u>legalizing or clarifying certain aspects of cannabis</u></a> have gotten some traction.</p><p>With all the cannabis tax revenue piling up in states where both medical and adult-use cannabis are legal—well over <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/agencies/legislative-council-staff/marijuana-taxes%C2%A0"><u>$300 million in FY 2019-2020</u></a> in Colorado, and topping <a href="https://www.fool.com/research/marijuana-tax-revenue-by-state/"><u>$1 billion in California</u></a> during that same period—state and federal lawmakers can’t just look the other way. They need to make more business-friendly things happen, starting with banking for cannabis businesses as a top priority. It’s been a long-term process, but it’s in progress.</p><h2><strong>The New Wave of Reefer Madness</strong></h2><p>Curiously, more news reports with misleading headlines and cherry-picked study findings are cropping up that seem timed to stop or even kill the legalization movement. </p><p>Cannabis is causing a <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/schizophrenia-and-weed"><u>mental health</u></a> crisis.

Cannabis <a href="https://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/heart-failure/features/marijuana-heart-failure"><u>can kill</u></a>.</p><p>This “reefer madness” redux is like nothing that’s been seen in the last 20 or 30 years. Something or someone—such as the anti-cannabis industry group <a href="https://learnaboutsam.org/who-we-are/leadership-team-2-2/"><u>Smart Approaches to Marijuana</u></a> (SAM)—is throttling up the chatter that serves to keep the conservative investor at bay and the anti-cannabis soothsayers wagging an “I told you so” finger at cannabis industry owners and operators.</p><p>SAM claims to have had over <a href="https://learnaboutsam.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/FINAL-SAM-2020-Annual-Report-1.pdf"><u>4,000 media mentions</u></a> in 2020 alone, including top outlets such as the New York Times, CNN, the Chicago Tribune, USA Today, the Associated Press, The Wall Street Journal, New York Post, Denver Post, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Fox News, NBC News, and Politico. </p><p>In 2019, SAM simply said that they had <a href="https://learnaboutsam.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/22689_3_2019AnnualReport_Final.pdf"><u>“set multiple records for media and press placements”</u></a> without giving any more specifics about what that meant. It appears that 2020 SAM wants you to know that mainstream media is more on board with its mission.</p><p>One of those SAM media mentions, CNN, has apparently stepped up their anti-marijuana reporting with a steady drumbeat of scary headlines in this year of more cannabis legalization efforts in Congress.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/11/health/weed-marijuana-smokers-toxins-wellness/index.html"><u>CNN Health report in January</u></a> cited a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30441-7/fulltext"><u>study</u></a> showing smoking cannabis may expose the consumer to the same type of toxic chemicals found in tobacco smoke.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/23/health/weed-cannabis-suicide-risk-study-wellness/index.html"><u>CNN Health report</u></a><u> </u>in June said that, according to a <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2781215"><u>study</u></a> by the American Medical Association, cannabis use may be linked to an increase in suicide. </p><p>But read further in the study and there is a sort of disclaimer: “Future research is needed to examine this increase in suicidality and to determine whether it is due to cannabis use or overlapping risk factors.”</p><p>Cannabis can cause schizophrenia, another <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/22/health/marijuana-schizophrenia-study-wellness/index.html"><u>CNN Health headline</u></a> on July 26 read. Dig deeper into <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01330-w"><u>the study</u></a> and you will find this: “However, it is unclear whether cannabis disproportionately increases the risk of specific types of psychotic experiences and whether genetic predisposition influences the relationship between cannabis use and psychotic experiences.”</p><p>On September 8, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/07/health/cannabis-heart-attack-young-adult-study-wellness/index.html"><u>CNN Health</u></a> cited <a href="https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/35/E1377"><u>a study</u></a> that found consuming cannabis can cause a heart attack. But beyond the headline, the study actually reported that its effect on “other cardiovascular outcomes” remains incompletely characterized. “Although heavy cannabis use has been reported to trigger acute myocardial infarction, the current evidence is limited to case–control studies that are prone to bias and studies relying solely on administrative data.” Hmm.</p><p>Then there is the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/17/health/marijuana-vomiting-wellness/index.html"><u>CNN Health report</u></a> on September 17 about <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15479672/"><u>cannabis-induced vomiting</u></a> happening to 19 chronic cannabis consumers in Australia in 2004, with a similar finding documented in eight cases in the U.S. in 2010. </p><p><br/>But researchers in those cases are not sure what it is about cannabis that is causing the vomiting, saying it may be related to the THC level (a big anti-cannabis talking point), or it may or may not be about the chronic cannabis consumer. Or, well, who knows. “It&#39;s not entirely clear who is predisposed to getting it,” said Dr. Sam Wang in the CNN report, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist and toxicologist at Children&#39;s Hospital Colorado, who treats adolescents with the condition. “Is it a certain frequency or duration of use? Is it a specific potency? Or is it a specific type of product? We don&#39;t have that data.”</p><p>Wang’s <a href="https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:d4a1cacf-3fab-43ef-b7b2-dcca7723d932"><u>research</u></a> also found that “the duration, frequency, route, or potency of cannabis products used that leads to greater risk for developing this illness has not been determined,” then added a contradictory statement that there is “substantial concern that the increase in long-term and frequent cannabis use, especially with products containing high amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), will lead to an increase in the prevalence of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS).” Hmm again.</p><p>On October 25, CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/health/marijuana-teen-vaping-wellness/index.html"><u>reported</u></a> that vaping marijuana by teens has doubled in the last seven years—linking marijuana to the evils of vaping, which is a real health crisis and another talking point of the anti-cannabis crowd. </p><p>Why are these reports appearing on such a worldwide media enterprise like CNN, that cherry-picks information from some science journals or lab researcher white papers without giving the whole story? Could it be timed to affect public perception as legalization actions have picked up this year? Let’s look. </p><h2><strong>Congress Sees Flurry of Cannabis Activity in 2021</strong></h2><p>There’s been a flurry of work this year in Congress—especially in September and October, when CNN anti-marijuana reports appeared to have ramped up—on legalizing or otherwise aiding the growth of the legal cannabis industry.</p><p>On September 24, the House of Representatives <a href="https://norml.org/blog/2021/09/23/house-advances-safe-banking-act-as-part-of-the-must-pass-ndaa/"><u>advanced</u></a> the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/1996"><u>Secure and Fair Enforcement Act (SAFE) of 2021</u></a>, which allows state-licensed marijuana-related businesses to engage freely in relationships with banks and other financial institutions, marking the fifth time the House has advanced the legislation in recent years. </p><p>It was offered as an amendment to the $740 billion <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4350/text"><u>National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022</u></a>, which passed the House and was sent to the Senate on October 18.</p><p>A bill to legalize cannabis that stalled last year in the House was discussed and advanced on September 30 in the House Judiciary Committee, with <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/30/house-committee-advances-bill-to-legalize-marijuana/"><u>a spirited discussion of the pros and cons</u></a> that generally appeared to favor advancing the bill. That far-ranging bill, the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3617"><u>Marijuana, Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act of 2021</u></a>, made history when the highest ranking senator, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-senate-finance-committee-chair-wyden-and-senator-booker-release-discussion-draft-of-cannabis-administration-and-opportunity-act-legislation-to-end-the-federal-cannabis-prohibition-and-unfair-targeting-of-communities-of-color"><u>released</u></a> a <a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/CAOA%20Detailed%20Summary%20-.pdf"><u>“discussion draft”</u></a> in July. </p><p>The MORE Act repeals the long-standing federal prohibition of marijuana by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act, ending the existing state/federal conflict in cannabis policies and providing state governments with greater authority to regulate marijuana-related activities, including retail sales. </p><p>Of all the cannabis-related bills in Congress, this bill likely has anti-legalization proponents on high alert. “Never before has public support from every corner of the political spectrum been so aligned as to demand that Congress take action to end the shameful experiment with marijuana prohibition,” NORML Political Director Justin Strekal <a href="https://norml.org/blog/2021/09/30/press-release-key-congressional-committee-advances-bill-to-repeal-federal-marijuana-prohibition/"><u>said</u></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjAKMq4tr4I"><u>SAM’s President and CEO Kevin Sabet</u></a> appeared on CNN with Erin Burnett the day that Schumer introduced the MORE Act discussion draft, shamelessly promoting his anti-marijuana book, and saying “there is a good reason why the scientific community is pretty united in opposing (the bill).”</p><p>On October 6, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Corey Booker (D-NJ), two long-time proponents of marijuana legalization and sponsors or co-sponsors of multiple pro-cannabis bills, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.10.06%20Letter%20to%20DOJ%20re%20Cannabis%20Descheduling.pdf?source=email"><u>wrote a letter</u></a> to new Attorney General Merrick Garland urging the Department of Justice to “initiate the process to decriminalize cannabis.”</p><p>Garland is seen as the final gatekeeper in allowing legalization. He said in <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?508877-1/attorney-general-confirmation-hearing-day-1"><u>testimony</u></a> during his Senate confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on February 22 that “it does not seem to me a useful use of limited resources that we have to be pursuing prosecutions in states that have legalized and are regulating the use of marijuana, either medically or otherwise,” when asked about marijuana legalization by Sen. Booker. “I don’t think it’s a good use of our resources where states have already authorized (marijuana), and it only confuses people, obviously, within the state.”</p><p>So what are industry watchers to make of the curiously coincidental big media attempts to squash the cannabis industry as the momentum for legalization speeds up? Is it a sign that the industry has matured to the point where tit-for-tat media hits will be a regular thing now? Is it just CNN and other media outlets seeing data deliveries like the Pew survey and then deciding to roll out more stories about marijuana because more people are talking about it? </p><p>Or is the recent big media negative publicity campaign a warning of more back-and-forth, more good-vs-evil discourse, more delays in legalization to come?</p><p>Stand by. CNN has the whole world watching.</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>9 Crazy Benefits of Hemp Fabric</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/benefits-of-hemp-fabric?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Bluntness Editorial</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fmj7hfscwq</guid><description>The benefits of hemp fabric have historical and scientific precedence.

It contains very low levels of THC and due to that, it is legal to sell multiple hemp products worldwide. </p><p>There are various hemp products on the market from foods to fabrics. </p><p>Hemp fabric is made using the stalks of Cannabis plants and was first derived in Asia and the Middle East. It has been recently recognized for its profound benefits. It is made using the outer layer of the stalk, which offers rope-like fibers. These are stripped and processed into ropes or yarn and when complete, it offers a similar texture to cotton.</p><h2><strong>The 9 Crazy Benefits Of Hemp Fabric</strong></h2><p>On that note, let’s take a look at the crazy benefits of hemp fabric that you probably aren’t aware of.</p><h3><strong>1. Naturally pest-resistant</strong></h3><p>Hemp is a natural botanical known to repel bugs and pests. It is therefore considered to be a great option for those who want to use pest-free products. You won’t have to worry about your fabrics being infested with pests and the outer layer of stalks is used, which is the most repellent part of the plant.</p><h3><strong>2. Durable and stronger</strong></h3><p>Hemp is considered to be one of the strongest natural plant fibers on the market for making fabrics. It is four times more durable than other natural fibers and therefore, can withstand more pressure and tension. For instance, if you are looking to create an extremely durable rope from natural materials, then hemp fabric is a good answer.</p><p>Thanks to it being more durable and withstanding, it is therefore much stronger. Therefore, it will be ideal for anyone looking to make bags and pouches that need to carry and transport heavy materials. The natural hemp fibers are also resistant to mold, which will help the fabric stay in better condition for longer to offer reduced damage and better reliability. </p><h3><strong>3. Longer-lasting</strong></h3><p>On the topic of being resistant to mold, hemp fibers are considered to be much longer-lasting than other natural fibers. Seeing as the fibers are strong and durable, they are less easy to damage and rip apart, which will mean that whatever you make with the hemp fabric, will last you a long time. </p><h3><strong>4. All-natural</strong></h3><p>Hemp is derived from the Cannabis plant, which is a naturally grown plant. It contains a legal amount of THC, a very minimal amount of 0.3% or less. If you are someone who likes to use natural materials, then hemp is a great answer.</p><h3><strong>5. Highly absorbent and breathable</strong></h3><p>Hemp materials are great at absorbing moisture, which makes them a great material if you want to make something breathable. It is a great option for clothing as will feel as close to cotton as you can imagine after being processed.</p><h3><strong>6. Doesn’t smell</strong></h3><p>Due to the hemp fabric being more breathable and easily absorbent, it is less likely to smell. Therefore, it is a great option for making clothes as the material won’t cling onto dirt or sweat and end up smelling after a few hours of wearing it. </p><p>Thanks to it being breathable and non-smelly, this makes it easy to care for and will require less frequent washing. Washing machines have a significant impact on the environment and the need to use them less will further enhance the sustainability of the fabric.</p><h3><strong>7. Sustainable and renewable</strong></h3><p>Thanks to the Cannabis plant being natural and easy to harvest, hemp fabric is extremely sustainable. With the world looking to be more sustainable, hemp fabric is a great option to produce clothes, bags, ropes, and more. Instead of using man-made synthetic materials, it is best to use naturally derived sources such as hemp as they have minimal impact on the environment. </p><p>Moreover, hemp is a highly renewable source. Renewable sources are best for the environment as they can be naturally grown. Hemp can be grown in many countries across the world. Anywhere with the right heat and humidity can produce hemp. The botanical grows fast and around three times a year in the right climate, which means that a lot of hemp fabric can be made to replace non-renewable options. </p><h3><strong>8. Anti-microbial</strong></h3><p>Using hemp fabric is highly beneficial for your health as much as the environment thanks to its anti-microbial properties. Manufacturers have found that hemp has secondary metabolites, which regulate and deter bacteria so that the fabric maintains its condition and safety. With bacteria rates increasing, it is a good idea to use fabrics that offer anti-bacterial and anti-microbial properties to maintain your health and safety. </p><h3><strong>9. Minimal environmental damage</strong></h3><p>Due to the easy and simple processing of hemp into the fabric, there is minimal damage to the environment when making rope, clothes, and more. From cultivation to creating products, there is little manual labor needed to make hemp fabric, which makes it a better option for the health of the environment. </p><p>Hemp is a remarkable material. It is all-natural and offers as many health benefits as it does for the environment. With it being strong, long-lasting, breathable, and non-smelly, it is a great option to use for clothing and more items. It will feel as close to cotton when processed correctly, which gives you even more reason to use natural and sustainable sources, like hemp, to produce your clothes. </p><p>With the world turning to more eco-friendly and sustainable options for their everyday lifestyles, hemp fabric will likely rise in popularity in years to come. The likes of hemp food and beauty products have recently increased in demand. Therefore, hemp fabric is likely right behind it thanks to its crazy health and environmental benefits.</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>Hemp</category></item><item><title>Can You Use Niacin to Beat a Drug Test?</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/niacin-and-drug-tests?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Taylor Engle</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fmmmxrmsat</guid><description>What is niacin and can you use it to pass a drug test?

It is known for reducing the risk of heart attack, nourishing your skin, and passing drug tests in a bind. </p><p>Most people get enough niacin from food, but the vitamin also comes in supplement form at pharmacies or other healthcare stores. It typically comes two different ways: nicotinic acid and niacinamide (a.k.a., nicotinamide). </p><h2>Niacin Effects and Benefits</h2><p>Outside of detoxing for an upcoming drug test, there are several reasons people turn to niacin as a dietary supplement. Here are some of niacin’s most commonly-recognized benefits:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10979113/" target="_blank"><strong>Niacin may help improve blood fat levels.</strong></a> This can result in an overall decrease in heart disease risk, and is ideal for anyone who can’t tolerate statin drugs. </li><li><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19054161/" target="_blank"><strong>Niacin may help reduce blood pressure.</strong></a> A function of niacin is its ability to release prostaglandins – a.k.a., chemicals that allow blood vessels to widen, which improves overall blood flow and can reduce blood pressure. </li><li><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6412771/" target="_blank"><strong>Niacin may boost brain function.</strong></a> Our brains need niacin to function properly and energetically, and studies have revealed that niacin seems to boost brain function and even undo brain cell damage caused by niacin deficiency. </li><li><a href="https://www.dermatologytimes.com/view/anti-aging-effects-niacinamide" target="_blank"><strong>Niacin may improve your skin’s health.</strong></a> Niacin is recognized for protecting skin cells from sun damage. Studies have shown that it may also be effective in preventing certain types of skin cancer as well. </li></ul><p>With a variety of healing effects, niacin sounds like a given when considering dietary supplements to add into the mix – drug test or not. However, high doses of niacin (anything over 2,000 mg per day) can come with some serious risks you should be aware of:</p><ul><li>Severe flushing of the skin (a.k.a. “niacin flush”)</li><li>Increased heartbeat</li><li>Itchiness</li><li>Nausea and/or vomiting</li><li>Abdominal pain</li><li>Gout</li><li>Diarrhea</li><li>Liver damage</li><li>Diabetes </li></ul><p>You should be especially wary of consuming too much niacin if you have gallbladder disease, liver disease, peptic ulcer disease, or severely low blood pressure. </p><h2>Niacin for Detox</h2><p>Like any vitamin or dietary supplement, niacin comes with a range of possible health benefits and possible side effects. But you might be wondering what to expect when doing a niacin flush.</p><p>A niacin flush is both the term used to describe the possible side effect you may experience from taking too much niacin at once (flushed, reddened skin), and the term for utilizing the vitamin to flush out your system quickly – usually before a drug test. </p><p>It’s niacin’s ability to bind to water-soluble materials (a.k.a., toxins) that makes it such a prime candidate for <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/cleanse-your-system-thc"><u>cleansing your system of unwanted toxins</u></a>. If effective, the vitamin basically increases the body’s fat breakdown, which increases metabolism.</p><p>Although this sounds great on paper, the method isn’t very reliable. It may or may not work depending on your age, height, weight, and other physiological factors, and you run a high risk of ingesting a dangerous amount of niacin in the process. </p><h2>Niacin for Passing a Drug Test</h2><p>Since niacin is known for its ability to flush out one’s system, cannabis consumers around the world have taken that to mean that the vitamin may be just as effective when the need arises to rid the body of THC.</p><p>However, this method is much more myth than fact. While the supplement may help speed the body’s natural detox along, it isn’t guaranteed to be successful, and the results can actually be dangerous if you’re not careful with the dosage. </p><p>Too much niacin can be very hard on the body and can pose serious health risks, depending on the person. It also isn’t a miracle solution and can take anywhere from 2-7 days to actually take effect. Finding an effective <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/best-detox-kits"><u>detox kit and program</u></a> is recommended over relying on niacin to detox your system.</p><h2>Closing Thoughts</h2><p>Overall, we feel there is a lot more risk than reward with the niacin flush detox method. However, there are plenty of other solutions for passing a drug test fast within the cannabis community, like exercising, taking hot showers, utilizing <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/best-detox-drinks"><u>detox drinks</u></a>, and, of course, abstaining from cannabis for the time being.</p><p>Still feel like you need some external aid to ensure your drug test success? <a href="https://passyourtest.com/"><u>PassYourTest.com</u></a> is an excellent resource for detox needs and solutions, without any of the risk that goes along with a last-minute niacin overdose. </p><p>The site offers a variety of detox kits for each type of cannabis consumer, accompanied by dietary supplements, meal plans designed for ultimate program success, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/are-at-home-drug-tests-accurate"><u>at-home test kits</u></a> to confirm “clean” status, and around-the-clock customer service and detox coaching to help you cross that finish line. </p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>cannabis</category></item><item><title>Curious Cultivars: Why is Gelatti from Cookies Such a Popular Strain?</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/strain-profile-gelatti?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Dante Jordan</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fknws2vsdt</guid><description>Gelatti strain profile: smell, taste, effects, history, and more.</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 12:15:20 +0000</pubDate><media:thumbnail url="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1500,h_843,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_2880,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fmhr2mtanc37cjz5jx.png" caption="Gelatti is another famous strain from the folks over at Cookies. | Image from Cookies"></media:thumbnail><flatplan:sponsor></flatplan:sponsor><flatplan:author name="Dante Jordan"></flatplan:author><keywords>cannabis,strain,cannabis strain,cookies</keywords><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another Cookies cultivar that you’ve heard the hype around. You know that a lot of the strains they put out are undeniably high quality, and because of that, you’re curious about what <a href="https://cookies.co/strains/gelatti" target="_blank">Gelatti</a> might be like. </p><p>The good news is we know this cultivar quite well, so if you’d like to know where the strain comes from, how it tastes, and if Gelatti is a head high or body high, you’ve come to the right place.</p><h2><strong>What is the Gelatti cannabis strain?</strong></h2><p>Gelatti is another famous strain from the folks over at Cookies. If you’re unfamiliar with them, Cookies is the brand responsible for some of the most popular, in-demand, strains in the world. </p><p>They bred the original Girl Scout Cookies, and are responsible for modern favorites like <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/georgia-pie-strain-profile"><u>Georgia Pie</u></a>, <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/gary-payton-strain-profile"><u>Gary Payton</u></a>, and many more. Gelatti is one of their most recent products in the past couple of years.</p><p>Gelatti is a cross of Gelato and Biscotti. Like many Cookies strains, its appearance features dense green buds that are stacked with purple accents and a whole flurry of trichomes. Gelatti is held in high regard for its invigorating effects and extremely unique flavor profile.</p><h2><strong>How to grow Gelatti</strong></h2><p>With Gelatti being exclusive to the Cookies library, there isn’t much information out there about how to grow it right now. Unless you’re connected to the Fam, or know someone that is, you’re not going to be able to find seeds or clones of Gelatti yet. </p><p>At some point, like all strains, they’ll find their way to the mainstream, which will flood the market with a variety of Gelatti types. By then, Cookies will probably be done producing the cultivar.</p><h2><strong>How does Gelatti smell and taste</strong></h2><p>Though the effects of this strain are great, its <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-mind-blowing-world-of-cannabis-terpenes"><u>terpene profile</u></a> is really what it’s known for. People love the smell and taste of Gelatti. </p><p>Influenced by both Gelato and Biscotti attributes, Gelatti comes forward with a combination of fruity, creamy, and mostly gassy fragrances. Picture a gas-dominant Gelato type of aroma; that’s pretty much what you get with Gelatti. Some people detect herbal accents as well. </p><p>On the taste, you’ll detect heavy gas flavors, mixed in with the typical earthiness of cannabis. <a href="https://cookies.co/strains/gelatti"><u>Cookies</u></a> describes the Gelatti aroma as gassy OG and strong menthol with a slight gelato finish, and the Gelatti flavor as musky OG menthol with a sweet exhale.</p><p>All of these aromas and flavors are a product of Gelatti’s terpene profile. <a href="https://www.leafly.com/strains/gelatti#terps"><u>Leafly’s verified strain data</u></a> suggests that Gelatti’s terps are dominant in caryophyllene, limonene, and linalool.</p><h2><strong>What do Gelatti’s effects feel like </strong></h2><p>Gelatti’s terps are awesome, but what really makes the strain special is the effects after consuming it. Whether as flower or concentrate, Gelatti usually hits with a pretty balanced high. What that means is that you can smoke it at any time of day and not feel too bogged down by it. </p><p>On <a href="https://www.leafly.com/strains/gelatti"><u>Leafly,</u></a> Gelatti’s top three most reported effects are happy, relaxed, and euphoric. On <a href="https://weedmaps.com/strains/gelatti"><u>Weedmaps,</u></a> Gelatti’s top three most reported effects are energetic, aroused, and uplifted. Because of it having such cerebrally stimulating effects, most people prefer to use Gelatti during active daytime hours.</p><p>In addition to its positive effects, consuming Gelatti comes with the normal downsides of cannabis use: dry mouth, red eyes, and potential dizziness for those who have absolutely no experience with cannabis. The best way to avoid these is to stay hydrated, and consume responsible amounts of Gelatti.</p><h2><strong>Is Gelatti a body high or head high?</strong></h2><p>With all cannabis, it’s important to remember that the effects vary by person. What’s a head high for you could be a body high for others. Some highs could also be both. This is because we all have individual <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/the-endocannabinoid-system-and-how-to-keep-it-strong"><u>endocannabinoid systems</u></a> that process cannabis compounds a certain way. That said, reviews on Gelatti indicate that the effects usually hit the head, but can also become a full-bodied experience for some.</p><p>Leafly reviewer <a href="https://www.leafly.com/profile/687ea465-a32f-41f4-a907-f15882255008"><u>M........4</u></a><strong> says “[Gelatti] first hits go to my head and then knees and feet taking all physical and mental pain away. I’m relaxed but I’m not tired. I fall asleep when I want but I’m not that sleepy. I sleep through the night and wake up refreshed. At this time I can’t think of a better high.</strong></p><p>Leafly reviewer <a href="https://www.leafly.com/profile/d4738a41-9ecf-41e1-a83e-a3cec7b0d7bf"><u>D........y</u></a> says Gelatti’s effects are <strong>“A full bodied, uplifting sensation overtakes your body as you exhale this wonderful strain.”</strong></p><p>A third Leafly reviewer <a href="https://www.leafly.com/profile/80c6e5ec-39a4-43b8-8786-aeff176126b8"><u>9........m</u></a> suggests that Gelatti is <strong>“Simply delicious for the mind.

And although the plant is known for helping <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6397040/"><u>PTSD</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2503660/"><u>pain</u></a>, both of which are <a href="https://www.ptsd.va.gov/understand/common/common_veterans.asp"><u>prominent</u></a> among active military members and veterans alike, these men and women still largely do not have access to legal cannabis.</p><p>This is one of the many reasons that federally legal cannabis is so necessary: without federal approval, the U.S. military doesn’t stand a chance of changing their stance on the plant. </p><p>And even with that impending approval on the horizon, there is no guarantee at all that the military will adopt new, more inclusive and compassionate standards surrounding cannabis – despite the fact that it’s helped so many veterans overcome their issues.</p><p>However, that hasn’t stopped the community from advocating for one another, and becoming increasingly outspoken about the issues they face, and the relief that cannabis has been able to provide.</p><h2><strong>The Vietnam War: An American Atrocity</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1170,h_1560,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fm7fx2bjpcncnp63ys.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of George Sollender"><figcaption>Amidst the traumatizing bloodshed, surfing was a common pastime among U.S. troops in Vietnam. | Image courtesy of George Sollender</figcaption></figure><p>U.S. military veteran George Sollender was drafted into the controversial Vietnam War in the early ’70s, although he had no aspirations at all to become a soldier.</p><p>“I graduated high school in 1969. All I thought about was surfing and girls,” Sollender told <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/"><u><em>The Bluntness</em></u></a><em>. </em>“Back then, they had the draft lottery. They drew my name right when I was reading about the Manson murders in the papers. I was number twelve on the lottery list.”</p><p>Sollender was drafted in February 1970, despite his strong distaste for the war and everything it represented. He didn’t have any other option but to show up.</p><p>“I would love to say I was a proud patriot of my country, but no. I was drafted into this crap. We all knew we were in the wrong, and when I came back, I could hardly talk to anyone about it. What, was I going to brag about burning villages down and killing innocent people?” Sollender said.</p><p>“I came back and grew my hair long, giving my opinions about the war to anyone who would listen. I was known as being unpatriotic for that. I tried to explain the devastation we did. It changed the way I thought about everything from then on – I just wanted to escape to the mountains.”</p><p>It was in Vietnam where Sollender and some of his fellow soldiers were first introduced to cannabis. While they were all constantly on edge and terrified for their lives, smoking the herb was the only thing that could bring them a semblance of relief. </p><p>“When they first got me in the jungle, I didn’t know what to expect. I was in a bunker and they told us the enemy was pushing towards us. I was scared as shit – I had no idea what to do,” Sollender said.</p><p>“These guys had this pipe and said here, take a hit. I said, ‘Are you kidding me?’ I was too freaked out, so I kind of faked my hits. But I realized after about a year, weed was the only thing that could calm down that anxiety.”</p><p>Despite the military’s (and the VA’s) zero-tolerance policy for cannabis, combat veterans like Sollender have been utilizing the plant in the shadows for decades for similar reasons: to soothe anxiety, instill some sense of confidence, and bring a small amount of comfort to a terrifying, harrowing experience.</p><p>As we mentioned earlier, military veterans are incredibly likely to develop PTSD – a cluster of symptoms where cannabis can be quite soothing – but this is something that lacks awareness to this day, and was basically unheard of in Sollender’s time in the military.</p><p>“I know [PTSD] has been in me for a long time. I’ve always been on edge, but I never even knew what PTSD was. I didn’t realize a lot of these things until I started going to counseling back in the ’80s,” Sollender said.</p><p>He was appointed to counseling through the VA, and once his counselor realized he was a combat veteran from Vietnam, he put Sollender in a group with other veterans who had gone through similarly traumatic experiences.</p><p>“Around then, they began to realize what was happening to us – the PTSD. Failed relationships, scattered thinking, wanting to escape, nightmares. All my life, it’s never gone away. I could put it aside, but it was like a floodgate when all of it started coming out,” Sollender said.</p><p>“Cannabis helped me when I got home. When you’re 19 years old and just a peace and love surfer guy, an experience like that really messes you up.”</p><h2><strong>The U.S. Military’s Lack of Compassion Drives Soldiers to Look Out For One Another</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_780,h_1040,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fm7fp2rxyw01sj0v67.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Image courtesy of George Sollender"><figcaption>George Sollender in his cannabis garden. A lot of what he grows ends up in the hands of combat veterans, who need this medicine. | Image courtesy of George Sollender</figcaption></figure><p>Sollender recalls when he and his fellow soldiers returned home: to disdain from the country, which only deepened when they grew out their hair, spoke out against the war, and kept smoking that grass.</p><p>This was the beginning of the persisting stigma against Vietnam veterans: a war that claimed the lives of <a href="https://www.history.com/news/vietnam-war-veterans-treatment"><u>over 58,000</u></a> American military members and wounded over 150,000. These veterans came back to be cast aside, labeled as crazy or incompetent, and forgotten.</p><p>“The way they portrayed us as dopers – that wasn’t even it, man,” Sollender said. </p><p>Although many veterans, both from Vietnam and otherwise, suffer from a number of ailments that cannabis could easily soothe, the U.S. military remains unflinching in their zero-tolerance policy.</p><p>However, after meeting other veterans through counseling and realizing the different issues they were suffering from (like cancer, PTSD, anxiety, depression, or chronic pain), Sollender came up with the idea to start giving away some of the plants he grows to veterans in need.</p><p>“I started growing back in 1976, when I moved to Northern California. Back then, people would buy small portions here and there, but I’ve never been much of a seller. I just don’t think that way,” Sollender said. </p><p>“I go to the mountains and buy clones every year of different strains, and then give away what I can to some veteran friends. It makes me feel better to help them than it probably does for them to receive it.”</p><p>Sollender’s cannabis helps veterans get through painful cancer treatments, ease PTSD, and soothe pain that has persisted for decades.</p><p>“I’m wound tight to this day. It calms me down. I usually wake up pretty early, and I’ll have coffee and go outside and take a bong hit or two. Otherwise, I sit there and worry about things that aren’t going to happen,” Sollender said. </p><h2><strong>Veterans’ Lack of Access to Cannabis is a Dangerous Game</strong></h2><p>Even though cannabis is fully legal in California, it’s still a struggle for veterans to gain proper access to the plant. </p><p>One of Sollender’s friends, who all wish to remain anonymous, worries that his insurance might throw him off if they find THC in his system. Instead, <a href="https://www.nursing.umaryland.edu/media/son/academics/professional-education/The-Opioid-Crisis-Treating-Our-Nations-Veterans-pdf.pdf"><u>veterans are prescribed opioids</u></a>, which are highly addictive and often fatal for this suffering community. </p><p>“Pain pills have been a huge problem for a lot of vets I know. Then, the VA knocks them off and makes them go cold turkey. They still won’t give them THC for the pain, so lots of people have to find a way to get around it,” Sollender said. </p><p>Although the cannabis stigma seems to be waning throughout the country and world, it persists in the military community, which is incredibly harmful for people who are in serious need.</p><p>Until justice is offered to veterans and active military members alike in the form of legal cannabis, people like Sollender will continue standing up for each other in the small ways. </p><p>“I’m just trying to make up for all the destruction we did,” Sollender said. “I just want to help people, and bring some good to the world any way I can.”</p><p><strong>Need a little more Bluntness in your life? </strong><a href="https://thebluntness.us3.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4d4a07837a28c3ba2f381906e&amp;id=4c4f2757a1" target="_blank"><strong>Sign Up</strong></a><strong> for our newsletter to stay in the loop.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded><category>military veterans</category></item><item><title>Recommended Detox Kits &amp; Programs Based on Your Timeline</title><link>https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/best-detox-kits?utm_source=RSS</link><author>Taylor Engle</author><guid isPermaLink="false">01fm984v25y6</guid><description>Got a drug test coming up?

A negative test result can be grounds for denied hiring, firing, or even worse, and if a detox kit might be able to save you from this cruel fate, we have a few to recommend. </p><h2><strong>What Makes a Strong Detox Kit &amp; Program?</strong></h2><p>With cannabis regulations still being hit or miss throughout the country depending on the region you’re in, the market is oversaturated with THC detox kits that claim to be the best in the game. </p><p>Too many options can be confusing, but there are a few things to keep an eye out for when determining which detox method will help <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/cleanse-your-system-thc"><u>cleanse your system of THC</u></a> faster than the natural detoxing cycle.</p><p>Essentially, you’ll want to aim for a detox kit that covers as many bases as possible: all-natural ingredients, a guide, meal plan ideas to optimize results, customer service support throughout your journey, and most importantly, a money back guarantee. </p><p>Bonus points if your test includes an <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/are-at-home-drug-tests-accurate"><u>at-home drug test</u></a> to verify your “clean” status before you show up for the real deal. </p><p>From <a href="https://www.thebluntness.com/posts/best-detox-drinks"><u>detox drinks</u></a> to copious amounts of sweating, there are a few quick tricks to clean your system and body of unwanted toxins, but <a href="https://passyourtest.com/permanent-cleansing-products/" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"><u>these detox kits</u></a> are tried, true, and likely your best shot at passing a drug test with flying colors (and residual cannabis in your system). </p><h2><strong>Recommended Detox Kits by Timeline</strong></h2><p>Before we get into the different detox kits that might work best for you, an important thing to keep in mind is that, even with a full system cleanse, you absolutely must stop consuming cannabis in order to have a successful result on your drug test.</p><p>A detox kit will help speed up your body’s natural cleansing process, but you’re only adding fuel to the fire if you continue to consume throughout the cleanse. I know it doesn’t sound very appealing, but it’s crucial to abstain from the plant until after you’ve passed. </p><h3><strong>Best Detox Kit to Cleanse in 30 Days</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1200,h_675,x_0,y_84/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmplus/thebluntness/01fm98eky5qz477e6em9.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most popular detox kits on the market is <a href="https://passyourtest.com/product/10-day-ultra-detoxification-program/" rel="sponsored" target="_blank"><u>PassYourTest’s 10 Day Ultra Detoxification Program</u></a>.

It’s imperative to ensure high cannabis quality, and even more so, a smooth smoke. No one wants a harsh tasting weed no matter how good it looks and smells. </p><p>If you’ve been growing cannabis at the crib, have harvested, and now you’re trying to lock in those final stages of production, here are some tips about what trimming your weed means, why it’s important, and how you can do it properly. </p><h2><strong>What does trimming weed mean?</strong></h2><p>Trimming cannabis means removing the excess sugar leaves from the actual cannabis buds. </p><p>When you grow a cannabis plant, it comes through like a flower with a bunch of excess leaves around it. These leaves are called fan leaves and sugar leaves. The fan leaves are the big cornhusk-like leaves that grow from the plant’s branches; the sugar leaves are the little leaves growing from your plant’s flowers. </p><p>Those leaves contain cannabinoids and terpenes, but you definitely don’t want to smoke them, especially the fan leaves. They’re extremely harsh on the smoke, and will make you cough up your lungs. Keep your lungs inside. You need those.</p><h2><strong>Wet trimming vs. dry trimming</strong></h2><p>There are two types of cannabis trimming: wet trimming and dry trimming.</p><p>Once you harvest your plants they’ll be full of moisture and nutrients that they took up during the growth phase. You can trim them then, or you can allow them to dry and then trim them after.  </p><h3><strong>Wet trimming </strong></h3><p>The advantages of wet trimming: your buds dry quicker if your grow environment dictates the need, it’s easier to remove the sugar leaves, and you don’t have to find somewhere to hang the plants. </p><p>The disadvantages of wet trimming: it’s sticky and you’ll walk away from the trimming session absolutely coated in sticky weed oils.</p><h3><strong>Dry trimming</strong> </h3><p>The advantages of dry trimming: you are able to dry your plant for longer, in the proper environment, and the plants are a lot less sticky once they’ve dried, and the sticky resin glands called trichomes on them have hardened. </p><p>The disadvantages of dry trimming: you have to be a little bit more delicate with the buds to protect the hardened, volatile terpenes.</p><p>Whichever type of weed trimming you decide is purely based on personal preference and necessity. There is no right or wrong answer.</p><h2><strong>Why is trimming weed important?</strong></h2><p>Trimming your cannabis is important because it helps make sure the smoking experience isn’t garbage. It really is that simple. It takes several months to grow cannabis, and you want the end result to be worth it. </p><p>If the end result is a plant that tastes super harsh and is extremely hard to enjoy, then all parties involved will be disappointed. Properly trimming your cannabis avoids this. </p><p>Additionally, trimming all the excess leaves off of your buds improves their bag appeal tremendously.</p><h2><strong>How to trim weed the right way</strong></h2><p>There are multiple ways you can trim your cannabis. The first that we’ll discuss is hand-trimming. It is believed to be the superior method.</p><h3><strong>The tools you need to hand trim your weed:</strong></h3><ul><li>Gloves</li><li>Scissors</li><li>A clean surface</li><li>A receptacle for the buds</li><li>A bowl</li><li>Isopropyl alcohol</li><li>Patience</li></ul><p>If you’re trimming cannabis, I shouldn&#39;t have to tell you to do so with gloves on. But put gloves on. It will protect your hands from the resin on the buds; more importantly, it will protect your precious cannabis flowers from whatever’s on your grubby little mitts. Once those are applied, grab your scissors. It’s game time.</p><p>The bowl and alcohol are for you to clean your hands and scissors during the trimming process as you’re sure to have oily trichomes bursting all over the place.</p><p>The clean surface is to make sure nothing taints your buds, so is the clean receptacle. After trimming your buds, put them in the receptacle until you’re done.</p><h3><strong>Step 1: Cut off the plant branches </strong></h3><p>Once your gloves are on, go ahead and cut the buds/plants off of the big branches. It’s much easier to deal with smaller pieces of the plant than it is to keep the whole thing intact during the trimming process.</p><h3><strong>Step 2: Remove fan leaves</strong></h3><p>After cutting your plants from the branches, next you want to get rid of those big fan leaves. To properly do so, it’s pretty simple: just pull them off. </p><h3><strong>Step 3: Buck buds from the branches</strong></h3><p>Once you trim the fan leaves off of the plants, go ahead and pluck the buds from the branches. This is called bucking.</p><h3><strong>Step 4: Trim sugar leaves from buds</strong></h3><p>Now that you’ve isolated your buds, it’s time to remove the smaller sugar leaves that are growing out of your nugs. Again, the process is pretty simple. Just take your little scissors and do your best to remove the excess foliage without damaging the actual cannabis buds. </p><p>To trim the right way, start at the bottom of the buds and work your way up. Remove all stems and little leaves. Also trim the orange and red pistils as close to the bud as you can.</p><p>At first this process will take a long while, but with more practice, you’ll eventually be trimming weed at warpspeed. The entire trimming process could take several days, or even a whole week. This is why it’s so critical to have a team of people to help you. </p><h3><strong>Step 5: Store your trimmed buds</strong></h3><p>After you’ve trimmed your buds, it’s important to store them properly for the final curing process. </p><p>The curing process is when your flowers get rid of excess moisture while breaking down excess sugars and chlorophyll. </p><p>The curing stage is probably the most important part of the entire growing process. It’s the final touch that locks in your quality. Some growers spend months raising beautiful plants, only to flop on the dry and cure, and be left with some harsh, grassy tasting buds. Don’t be one of those growers.</p><p>To properly cure your buds, store them in glass jars and put those jars into a dark cabinet with a cool temperature.</p><h3><strong>Step 6: Dispose of leftover shake</strong></h3><p>After you’re completely done trimming your cannabis buds, you’ll have a bunch of leftover cannabis debris. You could toss it away and just be done with it. Or you could use your leftover trim/shake to make other cannabis products. More on that in a sec.</p><h2><strong>The best trimming machines</strong> </h2><p>If you opt-out of hand-trimming your cannabis, this industry is full of trimming machines that will automate the process for you. Though convenient, and quick, it’s important to know that trimming machines may cause way more agitation to your plant than desired. </p><p>This could result in a much lower trichome density for your final buds than if you were using hands, gloves, and scissors. </p><p>Still, if you’re trimming a large amount of cannabis, machines could be of interest to you. You can peep <a href="https://herbceo.com/best-bud-trimmers/"><u>Herb CEO</u></a> and <a href="https://heavy.com/marijuana/bud-trimmer/"><u>Heavy</u></a> for suggestions on the best cannabis trimming machines. </p><h2><strong>What should you do after trimming weed</strong></h2><p>Once your buds are looking nice and groomed, you’ll have a lot of leftover trim to deal with. You can toss it in the trash, or you can use it a few other ways.</p><h3><strong>How to use your leftover weed trim: </strong></h3><ul><li>Make cannabutter and edibles</li><li>Make topicals</li><li>Compost it</li></ul><p>Trim has significantly less trichomes than your flower, however, it does still have them. Because of this, you are able to sugar leaves to make all types of concentrated cannabis products. You can decarboxylate it then make cannabutter; or you can make homemade salves; or you can use the leftover trim as straight up compost. </p><p>Whatever you do with your trim, just make sure to not smoke it. It’s safe to consume, but the experience will be incredibly poor.
