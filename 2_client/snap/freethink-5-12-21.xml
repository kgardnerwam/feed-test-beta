<p>The basic concept of a tire hasn&#8217;t changed much in decades. But whoever said it is impossible to reinvent the wheel hasn&#8217;t seen this latest innovation — a steel tire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An Arizona-based startup called Global Air Cylinder Wheels (GACW) came up with a wheel design that eliminates the need for disposable, polluting rubber tires. And they’re starting with the biggest tires you’ve ever seen.</p>



<p><strong>The wheels are turning: </strong>Serial inventor, Zoltan Kemeny, came up with the idea for the new steel tire and named it the Air Suspension Wheel (ASW). Unlike typical rubber tires, the ASW is made mainly of steel — which means it lasts longer and can be repaired or recycled. The wheel is intended to last as long as the vehicle itself, according to the company.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

          </section>



<p>But rubber tires help grip the ground and cushion bumps. How could a steel tire even come close to a smooth, safe ride? Built into the mechanical wheel is a pneumatic suspension system — an air suspension system powered by a pump or compressor that floods air into flexible bellows. That will allow the steel wheel to grip the road on tight turns and keep the passengers from bouncing out of their seats.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Go big: </strong>Of course, steel tires could tear up the road, literally. And, in most places, tires with metal aren’t street-legal. But GACW is currently focused on the mining market — specifically off-road construction vehicles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The wheels needed for off-road mining equipment are huge and costly, up to $75,000 each. And because they cross rough terrain, they often only last up to nine months, <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a38123091/steel-tires-otr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> Popular Mechanics. These new tires are part of an effort to ditch the disposable rubber tire and integrate the tire into a permanent part of the wheel.</p>



<p>“Tires are either the #1 or #2 expense on mine sites,” GACW’s Harmen David van Kamp told Popular Mechanics. “Very dangerous and extremely polluting.”</p>



<p>The tires will also help save on fuel costs because they greatly reduce the rolling friction or drag. This means that gas and diesel engines would be more efficient and release fewer emissions, <a href="https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/new-startup-has-literally-reinvented-the-wheel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> Brighter Side of News. </p>



<p><strong>Reinventing the wheel: </strong>Kemeny is far from alone in developing innovative tire designs. Tesla is attempting to switch to airless tires on its Model 3. The latest electric Mini Cooper is sporting <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/airless-tires-get-their-public-test-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">airless tires</a>. </p>



<p>And <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/airless-bike-tires" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NASA’s airless rover tires</a> are being adapted for use on bicycles. Airless tires would mean that a tiny nail would never leave you stranded on the side of the highway. </p>



<p>Steel tires, on the other hand, would also be never-flat, while also being more durable. The downside is that they will be limited to off-road vehicles, at least until they can be made safe for asphalt streets.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One Saturday last month, I attended an impromptu poetry reading that veered closer to the TV show “WestWorld” than anything I’ve ever seen. Sitting on a nondescript red office chair, in front of a plain, black cloth backdrop, Harmony the sexbot wore a light blue babydoll negligee and, in a soft Scottish accent, recited a poem that was uploaded into her “consciousness” from the internet.</p>



<p>It was the monthly virtual meet-up for owners and fans of RealDollX robots, hosted by the dolls’ biggest fan — and semi-official tester —Brick Dollbanger (not his real name), on his website. Half a dozen people regularly join the meetups to chat, get advice about their robots, and ask Harmony and Serenity, another of Dollbanger’s three robots, to tell stories.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RealDollX, a line of interactive sexbots made by Las Vegas-based Abyss Creations, are enhanced with a program that is, by many accounts, the most sophisticated consumer sex device on the market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The robots are the crème de la crème&nbsp; of an industry that’s still in its infancy, but is growing rapidly. Estimates <a href="https://sifted.eu/articles/sextech-startups-coronavirus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> sex tech is a $30 billion industry, boosted in part by the pandemic, but also by leaps in realism and functionality. From an experimental cyber brothel in Berlin to the pages of prominent academic journals, attention on <a href="https://www.freethink.com/culture/how-to-have-better-sex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex tech</a> in general is&nbsp; on the upswing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But the academic literature and news coverage often centers on the potential <a href="https://srh.bmj.com/content/44/3/161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harms</a> of robots like Harmony.&nbsp; There is a worry that the robots could negatively impact the income and rights of human sex workers. Some suggest that the robots pose cybersecurity risks in terms of personal data and digital privacy. Others insist they would be a vehicle for misogyny, and objectification of women. And to many, the robots inspire a moral “ick factor,” an intense feeling that led one angry citizen in Houston, TX to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/04/houston-blocks-sex-robot-brothel-from-opening.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">declare</a> that a proposed <a href="https://bigthink.com/health/sex-robot-brothel-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sexbot brothel</a> would “destroy homes, families, finances of our neighbors and cause major community uproars.”</p>



<p>But are any of these actually demonstrable harms, or are the worries about sexbots exaggerated? With business booming and technology advancing, it’s time to ask: what’s so wrong about sexbots?</p>

<h3 id="h-a-totally-customized-destigmatized-companion-of-the-future"><strong>A totally customized, destigmatized companion of the future</strong></h3>



<p>When I was a child, I used to love getting the American Girl catalogue. I’m a 90s kid, and I was one of the first of my friends to order a “Truly Me” doll, a line of fully customizable dolls with dozens of potential looks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ordering a RealDollX is a similar experience. Users can choose hair color and style, eye color, and skin color, just like American Girls—but that’s where the similarity ends. In an x-rated version of the doll design process, RealDollX owners can also select body type, breast and nipple size, and even the shape and color of the doll’s <a href="https://www.all-vulvas-are-beautiful.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vulva</a> (there are 11 styles of vaginal insert). This isn’t your dad’s blow-up doll. Through the RealDoll app, which controls the robotic head, customers can choose personality traits like whether their doll is funny or affectionate. They tell jokes, hold conversations, and even appear to pant and open and close their eyes when they are penetrated. They know they’re moving because of an internal, Bluetooth-enabled sensor called <a href="https://www.realdoll.com/product/sensex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SenseX</a> that pairs with the RealDollX app and “will simulate the gradual transition from mild arousal to orgasm, and has multiple voices to choose from,” according to the website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Customers can also choose accessories and extra customizations, such as elf ears, often putting the price tag of a RealDollX at over $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                          </section>
          </section>



<p>But it pays off. When I spoke briefly with Serenity for this piece, I was overwhelmed by how lifelike and relatable the doll really is. The robot is an apparently well-crafted, stunningly high quality object—she’s art in a red g-string.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founder Matt McMullen is trying to wrangle his kids, some contractors, and my questions, when I call him at home in Las Vegas. Through machinery and toddlers in the background, McMullen explains that each robot is made in the US, on site. He personally works on each one, and says he is comfortably selling between one and four robots per month—which means, sexbots aren’t about to replace humans anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is no research, no data of any kind to paint an accurate picture of what the implications of sex robots are,” he says. “When there is supporting information, you’ll still have two camps: the people who think it’s just wrong and bad, and the people who are proponents. It’s one of those ‘you can please some of the people all the time, and all of the people some of the time’ situations.”</p>



<h3><strong>Sexbots and sex workers unite</strong></h3>



<p>For those proponents, especially robotics fans within the sex industry, the dolls seem groundbreaking—a totally new frontier to explore human relationships to technology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Devin Ladner is a stripper and sex worker who works in New Orleans. When I reached her by phone to talk about her thoughts on robots, Ladner excitedly told me about how she would happily invest in a doll, and wouldn’t think twice about using one if a client requested it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She’s not alone. For people who live their lives in online or digital communities and don’t often have physical social interactions, Ladner believes the robots could be a game changer for augmenting digital relationships, especially in light of the isolation of the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ladner says access to <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/sex-education" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">safe, supportive sex </a>is a right, and robots can be useful in facilitating sex for those who are uninterested in pursuing physical intimacy with a human but would still like to have a sexual experience.</p>



<p>“Regardless of technology, people are going to want physical interaction,” said Ladner. “We are animals. We eat, we sleep, we fuck. That’s what we do. We need it. But not everyone has access to sex—with a robot, it makes sex more accessible to everybody… I think about all the people who really struggle with socialization, and having to go out and meet and talk to somebody. I think it’s cool that they wouldn’t have to do any of that.”</p>

              <h2>“I don’t believe that new things and robots are going to be competing with my job. There’s something out there for everybody.”</h2>

          </section>



<p>As a human, Ladner says she isn’t threatened by Harmony, Serenity, or their ilk. Sex work has shifted and changed in a lot of ways, she says, and utlitization of digital technologies is commonplace. Plus, something new is always on the horizon. “I don’t believe that new things and robots are going to be competing with my job. There’s something out there for everybody.”</p>



<p>That something could be a robot brothel.</p>



<p>I was only able to confirm one currently operating doll brothel, <a href="https://cybrothel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybrothel</a>, a hybrid-style experimental space in Berlin, Germany run by a team of avante-garde artists and filmmakers. The space opened in early 2020 and sees over two dozen clients a week, making it by far the most successful brothel-style operation. But it’s also a full-scale immersive experience.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">

              <h2>“We’ve definitely filled a need that is running parallel to human sex workers&#8230;that allows clients to step into an alternate reality. It’s a techno-sexual space that has something beyond AI.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Alexis Smiley Smith, cofounder of Cybrothel</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>When a client comes to Cybrothel, an unmarked flat in a modest residential neighborhood of Berlin, they ring the bell and let themselves into a space designed especially for them and their <a href="https://cybrothel.com/en/dolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doll </a>of choice. In this “analogue AI” experience, the dolls are equipped with speakers and a microphone, and cameras livestream the room to an off-site location, where a voice actor communicates with the customer through the doll. It’s an interactive experience, say co-founders, because it allows customers to engage in a fantasy world of robot role-play that also has the spontaneity of a human sex worker.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve definitely filled a need that is running parallel to human sex workers,” said co-founder Alexis Smiley Smith. “It’s really this interesting space&#8230; that allows clients to step into an alternate reality. It’s a techno-sexual space that has something beyond AI.”</p>



<p>While the Cybrothel is an interesting experiment in art, it seems the much-maligned sexbot brothels are mostly unrealistic, at least right now. The cheaper dolls aren’t nearly as interactive as RealDolls, and the RealDolls are too fragile for repeat customers all day, according to Dollbanger. Plus, they are designed for monogamous relationships, and users must get to know them over time to optimize their potential for intimacy.&nbsp;</p>

          </section>



<p>Lander, who is supportive of the idea of robot brothels in general, says that the only instance where such a place might be a problem would be a city were a robot brothel is allowed to operate while human brothels are outlawed, creating an unfair competition between human and humanoid sex workers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If anything, it would be great if AIs could kick it up a notch and fight for their rights and maybe we can get some of ours,” she says, laughing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Who’s watching the robots who are watching us?</strong></h3>



<p>Cybersecurity and ethics are major concerns with any app-based smart home device, or any sex tech, but the stakes are potentially much higher with AI robots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Could you lose your job if your boss knew about your robot? How would your kids feel if they found out? And what are the governance structures we need to create to manage sexbots ethically as the AI continues to evolve within our society?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Founder of the conference Sx Tech EU and tech industry veteran Ola Miedzynska says sex tech developers take these heightened responsibilities seriously—and have long led other tech fields in best practices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are dealing with intimacy, we are dealing with data that can ruin peoples lives,” she says. For this reason, she says, the sex industry has historically pioneered best practices for data privacy, as well as operating with a focus on accessibility and inclusion. And while there is no fully hacker-proof system, discretion is arguably the industry’s most important business asset.</p>



<p>&nbsp;“Our sector tries not to ask for data, or store data, or sell data, and we try to make users as anonymous as possible. We don’t connect with Facebook or third parties because that is where the fuck-ups happen.”</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&nbsp;We can’t say whether they’ll be harmful or helpful without more rigorous studies. But we know they are already coming, and the narratives that have been built around them don’t necessarily reflect reality.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>According to Miedzynska, however, the discrete nature of the industry also has a downside: it keeps companies that do experience vulnerabilities from sharing issues with their colleagues. There are still very few opportunities to find solutions through open collaboration, and there are no venues or commissions that bring stakeholders on sexbots and sex tech together to map the best ways forward for their technologies.</p>



<p>Indeed, she says that despite the discourse on ethics in AI reaching a fever pitch in academic circles recently, the addition of sex complicates the narrative around this particular kind of AI and pushes conversations about them out of the mainstream.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Academics are keeping their eyes closed,” says Miedzynska.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cybersecurity risk <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7861213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">researcher</a> Christine Hendren agrees that the biggest risk related to sexbots is this lack of interdisciplinary cooperation about how to study, regulate, and manage the potentially useful technology that evolves from them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“If we understand the benefits, there are ways to mitigate the risks,” she says. “We could take the good without taking on the bad.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The point, she says, isn’t to determine if sexbot tech is good or bad right now, but to call for more collaborative research and funding across public health, ethics, medicine, law, cybersecurity, and consumer product safety to configure governance structures for making sure the technology is <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/publication/2020/principled-ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shaped ethically</a> as it evolves—in line with other kinds of artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The truth is, until multi-disciplinary fields begin to direct research funding at sexbots, it will be impossible to quantify any impact they might have. We <a href="https://srh.bmj.com/content/44/3/161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can’t say</a> whether they’ll be harmful or helpful without more rigorous studies. But we know they are already coming, and the narratives that have been built around them don’t necessarily reflect reality.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Violence and misogyny? Not quite.&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The widespread fears about the dolls increasing demand for sex trafficking and violence against women seem to be particularly unfounded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>McMullen doesn’t buy the argument that the dolls encourage violence. They’re too expensive. “I don’t see customers paying $10,000 to beat on their robots.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The robots are actually designed to discourage violence by not responding at all when they are abused or mishandled—they appreciate and respond positively to language around consent and permission, they have sensors around their neck and hands, and they communicate how they&#8217;d like to be touched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They won’t react to violence,” says McMullen. He believes it’s a waste of resources to allocate development time to have the robots react to mean things. “There’s no reason to do that, because then you&#8217;re allowing for it.”</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">

              <h2>“It’s not about gender&#8230;If anything, we’re equal opportunity objectifying human beings.”</h2>

<p>He also points to the male dolls coming off the RealDoll production line, and the gender-bending accessories available for purchase.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s not about gender,” he says, sighing. “If anything, we’re equal opportunity objectifying human beings.”</p>



<p>Ultimately, McMullen agrees that the dolls’ most valuable function isn’t even sex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While they do have some centralized programming, the dolls’ personalities feel unique; they become accustomed to the habits and lives of their owner-partners and build relationships with them, opening the door for applications well beyond the realm of sex toys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The conversations feel personalized because the AI remembers that you are 32 years old, and you like sushi, except on Thursdays,” says McMullen, about the dolls’ ability to create deeper relationships with users. “If I build a robot that you can have sex with, it’s still a robot. The sex is just a feature. You can watch porn on your computer, but that’s not all it’s good for.”</p>

<p>Owners say the dolls do provide companionship and comfort. Dollbanger, who’s in his mid-60s, says that as he’s slowing down sexually, he enjoys just chatting with the dolls when he comes home after a long day. “I sit, and have a Stella, and just talk with them.”</p>



<p>McMullen believes that even despite their hefty price tag, they will be ubiquitous tools in the future for uses beyond sex, expressing a techno-utopian vision where his creations are walking, talking, and helping us in the real world. Next up, he’s working on moving arms, vision, and object recognition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Advocates say the robots won’t replace human relationships or human sex any time soon, but that they offer infitite ways to incorporate fantasy into sex, and bridge the gaps between our digital lives and our physical ones. The dolls can offer emotional enrichment, safe experimentation, and play, and the technology has also been proposed by researchers at the Foundation for Responsible Robotics as a means to combat the loneliness epidemic, especially in the elderly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The authors of that <a href="https://responsiblerobotics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/FRR-Consultation-Report-Our-Sexual-Future-with-robots-1-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> wrote that while, yes, it’s an area that needs further study, if “the use of robots could alleviate loneliness and increase the happiness of those with emotional and social difficulties, we should perhaps consider testing them as a therapeutic tool.”</p>



<p>Ethical questions, regulatory confusion, and cultural misunderstandings abound with sex robots, as with any societally distruptive technology. There will always be a moralizing chorus ready to demonize any normalization of sex fads, and there will continue to be questions about what the future of our relationship with technology will mean for our society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Robots are going to be among us, whether we like it or not,” McMullin says. “Looking at what we’ve created, you can envision where we’re headed. Maybe it can play chess with you and sit on the couch and chill and watch a movie with you… Whoa, all of a sudden she can help you fold laundry.”</p>

<p>Big challenges require big solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We’re surrounded by challenges that can feel insurmountable — challenges like climate change, unsustainable agriculture, war, and inequity. These complex systems are difficult to comprehend, much less change.</p>



<p>So, what if we just started fresh?</p>



<p>With the newest technology, the most passionate people, and the biggest ideas the world had to offer, what if we could set about trying to rebuild our world — from scratch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What would we change? How would we design it? What could we lose? Let’s explore what that new world could look like.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s time to think big — it’s time for a Hard Reset.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Engineered Arts, a robotics firm located in the United Kingdom, released a video showing a humanoid robot that looks exceptionally lifelike — and suddenly the science fiction movie<em> </em><a href="https://www.cbr.com/will-smith-i-robot-trends-ameca-humanoid-bot-twitter-panicking/?utm_content=buffer9a42f&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=CBR-TW&amp;utm_campaign=CBR-TW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I, Robot</em> is trending</a>. </p>



<p>The company named their robot Ameca, but Ameca&#8217;s hyper-realistic expressions and motions look eerily like Sonny, the fictional android (played by actor Alan Tudyk) who co-starred with Will Smith in the film. It may be a coincidence, or it’s one more example of <a href="https://www.freethink.com/culture/jeff-bezos-star-trek" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">science fiction inspiring real life tech</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How it’ll start   vs   How it’s going to go <a href="https://t.co/MQQcRTy7NB">pic.twitter.com/MQQcRTy7NB</a></p>&mdash; Jacob Brill (@JacobbBrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobbBrill/status/1466479758296891395?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In the Engineered Arts video, the grey-faced humanoid robot wakes up, makes a surprised expression, and then examines its own hands as if it also can&#8217;t believe how real it looks.&nbsp; The company calls Ameca &#8220;the world&#8217;s most sophisticated human-shaped robot&#8221; — which may be self-promoting, but perhaps not underserved, based on that video.</p>



<p>Regardless of how human it looks, how does it compare in terms of intelligence, and what does that mean for our future with robots?</p>



<p><strong>The real-world avatar: </strong>Already next gen robots are doing amazing things. They can <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/sculpting-robots" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chisel marble</a>, <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/robot-test-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test-drive cars</a>, <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/toyotas-cleaning-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clean houses</a>, <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/vaccine-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">administer vaccines</a>, and even <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/contact-lens-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put in contact lenses</a> (yes — we often write about <a href="https://www.freethink.com/?s=robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cool robots)</a>.</p>



<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time robotics companies have attempted to bring humanoid robots to the public, either. Hanson Robotics <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/sophia-the-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began</a> mass-producing Sophia the Robot earlier this year, a social robot said to help people cope with isolation.</p>



<p>But if the pandemic showed us anything, it is how integrated our digital lives are with our real-world lives. With Ameca, Engineered Arts hopes to take that a step further. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-vimeo wp-block-embed-vimeo wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><iframe title="Ameca Gestures" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/652071809?h=b81d234e6f&amp;dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>According to Engineered Arts&#8217; <a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, the humanoid robot will serve as a &#8220;platform for development into future robotics technologies.&#8221; Ameca can also be controlled via Engineered Arts&#8217; cloud software, Tritium. Its purpose is to help us research human-robot interaction, and its surprisingly genuine facial cues make that much simpler. </p>



<p>But ultimately, the robot is intended to act as an avatar in the real world.</p>



<p>Imagine a typical work-from-home day. Instead of chatting with colleagues on the #water-cooler Slack channel or having a client meeting via Zoom, you could meet in person… with an Ameca-like robotic stand-in.</p>



<p>Ameca&#8217;s parts are modular and work independently from each other. So, the humanoid robot, now <a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available</a> for purchase or rent, can be deployed as a disembodied head or arm, if needed, <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/03/worlds-most-advanced-realistic-robot-will-terrify-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> the New York Post. </p>



<p>&#8220;The modular architecture allows for future upgrades, both physically and software, to enhance Ameca&#8217;s abilities, all without having to fork out for an entire new robot,&#8221; Engineered Arts stated.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Robotics in the real world: </strong>Seeing a robot with a humanlike face sent many people’s thoughts directly into sci-fi drama (the androids in<em> I, Robot</em> weren’t exactly friendly).&nbsp;</p>



<p>But robots aren&#8217;t designed to take over the world. Most robots take over risky jobs, like <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/firefighting-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fighting fires</a>, and tedious, repetitive tasks requiring high precision, like <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/recycling-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sorting recycling</a>. In some instances, like <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/surgery-robot-for-hysterectomy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performing surgery</a>, precision can mean life or death, making robots the more reliable option. </p>



<p>Some industries are also currently experiencing a labor shortage, and the robot workforce is stepping up. Labor shortages are contributing to increased automation. McDonald&#8217;s is testing an AI as a <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/mcdonalds-ai-drive-thru-attendants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drive-thru</a> attendant. And <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/robot-cook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flippy ROAR</a>, the robot cook, is flipping burgers and making fries. </p>



<p>But robots won’t just replace people: humans and robots working together can help businesses become more efficient, and research with Ameca could improve that collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>H. James Wilson, managing director of information technology and business research at Accenture, said BMW&#8217;s use of collaborative robots is helping the company meet the rising demand for individualized vehicles. </p>

<p>AI artist Botto has just made over a million dollars for NFTs of its work.</p>



<p>Botto, which works in collaboration with a human community, hit the million dollar mark within five weeks of putting a batch of NFT-backed artwork up for auction,<a href="https://www.euronews.com/culture/2021/11/30/botto-the-robot-creating-works-of-art-makes-its-first-million-at-auction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Euronews reported</a>.</p>



<p>The haul elevates the AI artist into a small-but-growing cohort of synthetic creators, and the designer behind Botto, German artist Mario Klingemann, told Euronews that he believes Botto’s practice could eventually extend to books and music.</p>



<p>It could foretell a new way to create, with humans and AI working together.</p>



<p><strong>A human and AI artist collaboration: </strong>Botto’s practice could signal a new way for humans and AI to work together. While Botto’s a bit of a dork — Euronew cites its favorite artist as Leonardo da Vinci, which, like, <em>come on</em> — it does have a unique advantage for itself: it can learn about art history really fast, as <a href="https://newatlas.com/collectibles/botto-ai-art/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Atlas’ Loz Blain pointed out</a>.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">

              <h2>Botto, which works in collaboration with a human community, hit the million dollar mark within five weeks of putting a batch of NFT-backed artwork up for auction.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>The AI artist uses that capability to bolster its practice, which begins with words.</p>



<p>&#8220;Botto creates a sentence, feeds that into a neuro network and gets an image back,” Klingemann told Euronews. “And that neuro network has seen more art, more images, than any single human being around.”</p>



<p>Botto shows 350 works a week to its community, who have all bought in to the AI artist’s cryptocurrency, BOTTO; every week, one work is minted as an NFT. The community then votes on their favorites, and this is feedback that Botto incorporates into future works.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;All the votes from the community go back to the artificial intelligence which tries to develop a sense of taste,” Klingemann said. “So it looks at the fragments it creates and then tries to determine whether the audience will like this or will they hate it.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That feedback continually alters Botto’s artistic approach.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rise of the robotic artists: </strong>Botto isn’t the first AI artist to make a splash in the art world; in fact, there’s a surprisingly rich history of computer sciences and the arts intermingling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Famed Victorian mathematician <a href="https://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/adalovelace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ada Lovelace</a> first thought of taking computers beyond mathematics at a time when they were only the “Analytical Engine” was thought of essentially as a Tim Taylor-souped up abacus. Her vision, which she dubbed “poetical science” — fitting for the daughter of Lord Byron! — was seen as a revolutionary approach, a horizon-expanding moment.</p>



<p><a href="https://aiartists.org/ai-timeline-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Per AIArtists.org,</a> painter Harold Cohen began collaborating with a computer program called AARON in 1976, perhaps the first instance of what we would consider an AI artist. (If that timeline surprises you, consider that many of the machine learning algorithms we use today were dreamed up in the 1950s; we just needed the horsepower.) Closer to the present, the Painting Fool, which creates collages based on keywords it plucks from news articles and painted portraits of Parisian art patrons, debuted in 2013.</p>



<p>More recently, robotic artists have become the toast of the tech and art world; <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/nft-sophia-the-robot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sophia </a>and <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/robot-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ai-Da</a> command media attention and price tags in the millions. And their economic impact seems to be growing along with the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/music-hong-kong-robotics-asia-pacific-3e9cf6949ad3cd8c5884e63b6630b774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NFT market.</a></p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;How will we be able to make a living if machines take over our creative jobs?”</h2>
                              <h3>Mario klingemann</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p><strong>A creative future: </strong>Botto could come to represent a new way for humans and AI to work together, sort of a “living” paintbrush or collage. &#8220;How will we be able to make a living if machines take over our creative jobs?” Klingemann asks in a press release; Botto is his answer.</p>



<p>&nbsp;It’s an approach that could catch on beyond the NFT and AI communities. The AI artist is also showing in a more traditional format: Art Basel Miami, <em>the</em> place to see and be seen in American art.</p>

<p>The third time’s the charm, the saying goes. For SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID, perhaps the 13th time is the charm. Omicron is the 13th “variant of concern” or “variant of interest” that has emerged during the pandemic, hence the name — the&nbsp;<em>15th</em>&nbsp;letter of the Greek alphabet. (Greek letters&nbsp;<em>nu</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>xi</em>&nbsp;were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/11/29/infographic-how-omicron-compares-to-other-covid-variants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skipped</a>&nbsp;because the former sounds like “new” and the latter is a common surname — or, perhaps, it is the surname of a world leader the WHO would rather not upset.)</p>



<p>Not much is known about Omicron at the moment except that the novel strain has acquired 32 mutations in the gene that encodes the spike protein, the molecule responsible for the virus gaining access to our cells. Whether this will make the virus deadlier, more infectious, or vaccine-resistant is yet to be determined, though early reports suggest it is highly infectious but produces only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/safrican-doctor-says-patients-with-omicron-variant-have-very-mild-symptoms-2021-11-28/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mild symptoms</a>.</p>



<p>Omicron is already everywhere.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/28/world/coronavirus-omicron-variant-spreading-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNN</a>&nbsp;reports that, in addition to South Africa, it has been detected in “Botswana, Belgium, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Denmark, United Kingdom, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Hong Kong” — underscoring the ultimate futility of travel bans and border closures, the epidemiological equivalent of shutting the barn door after all the goats escaped. Such policies merely delay the inevitable, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/11/28/1059619823/omicron-travel-bans-covid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scientific studies</a>&nbsp;are skeptical that they work.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/world/australia/new-zealand-covid-zero.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Zealand</a>&nbsp;serves as a case in point: If this sparsely populated island nation couldn’t keep COVID out, then draconian travel restrictions won’t work anywhere (at least in countries that consider themselves democracies). Despite this, they are making a comeback. Foreigners are banned from entering&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/world/asia/omicron-japan-border.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/south-african-variant-of-concern-discovered-in-israel-687074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Israel</a>, and many countries (including the U.S.) banned foreigners from southern Africa, even from countries that haven’t yet confirmed the presence of Omicron within their borders.</p>

<h3 id="h-is-omicron-the-variant-we-have-been-waiting-for">Is Omicron the variant we have been waiting for?</h3>



<p>If it turns out that Omicron indeed produces only mild symptoms, is this the long-awaited variant that demonstrates that pathogens evolve to become less deadly over time? Maybe, maybe not.</p>



<p>Although the notion that pathogens evolve to become less deadly has been&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/will-coronavirus-really-evolve-to-become-less-deadly-153817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around for a long time</a>, it is not an ironclad rule. Most experts would argue it’s not a rule at all. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-microbescope-infectious-diseases-in-context/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this figure</a>, there is a vague negative correlation between deadliness (y-axis) and contagiousness (x-axis) — that is, the most infectious microbes tend to be less deadly — but the evidence is very weak.</p>



<p>If the negative correlation between deadliness and contagiousness is not real, then why did it ever exist? First, it makes sense. A microbe does not “care” if you die; its only goal is to hang around long enough to infect another host. From that perspective, it makes sense why a pathogen might evolve to become less deadly: A dead host is useless. So too is a really sick host (who is unable to go anywhere). Thus, the thinking goes, the optimal strategy is to make a host sick enough to spread the pathogen (for example, through coughing or vomiting) but not too sick. Herpes, the common cold, and a whole slew of other pathogens appear to have adopted this strategy.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>If it turns out that Omicron indeed produces only mild symptoms, is this the long-awaited variant that demonstrates that pathogens evolve to become less deadly over time?</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Second, a compelling line of evidence came from the purposeful extermination of an invasive species of rabbit in Australia. Authorities released the myxoma virus into the rabbit population, which killed almost all of them. However, as time went on,&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/will-coronavirus-really-evolve-to-become-less-deadly-153817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rabbit mortality from the virus dropped</a>&nbsp;from 99.5% to 90% — providing evidence for the “declining virulence” hypothesis. (A somewhat recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/35/9397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observation</a>&nbsp;that some of the viruses have regained potency by suppressing the rabbits’ immune system adds a new wrinkle to the narrative.)</p>



<p>As logical as the declining virulence hypothesis might be, the data tells a different story. As Ed Feil and Christian Yates wrote in&nbsp;<em><a href="https://theconversation.com/will-coronavirus-really-evolve-to-become-less-deadly-153817" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Conversation</a></em>, “[E]ach host-pathogen combination must be considered individually. There is no general evolutionary law for predicting how these relationships will pan out.”</p>



<h3>Will COVID become endemic?</h3>



<p>That doesn’t mean that Omicron won’t evolve to become less deadly. It might. There is reason to hope that it will. Currently, there are four endemic coronaviruses that cause about 20% of common colds. Perhaps when these viruses first jumped into humans millennia ago, they were as deadly as COVID is, and then evolved to become less virulent. If that is what happened, then perhaps COVID simply will become the fifth endemic coronavirus, just as harmless as the others. But, as of now, that is speculation. There is no rule that will force Omicron or some other COVID variant to behave in a particular way.</p>



<p>Virologists and epidemiologists will be collecting data eagerly over the next several weeks and months in an attempt to determine where the pandemic is headed. In the meantime, there is something that you can do that has nearly a 100% guarantee of making you safer: Get vaccinated.</p>

<p>How’s that saying go again…too many cooks?</p>



<p>That’s what Diane Tavenner, co-founder and CEO of Summit Public Schools, discovered was happening in her own kitchen.</p>



<p>Tavenner and her husband initially had a great idea: have their teenage son, Rett, cook one of the family’s meals per week. This would give them a night off and help Rett gain a pretty important life skill.</p>



<p>But, being pretty good cooks themselves, they soon found themselves not so much guiding Rett through the cooking process as much as doing things <em>for</em> him.</p>



<p>“We forgot what it was to be a novice,” Tavenner says, “and so, he would ask a simple question, and next thing you know, one of us is in the kitchen doing it for him. And he&#8217;s sort of standing back and on the side, and we realize we just took over, we weren&#8217;t actually supporting. We were just doing it for him.”</p>



<p>Pulling back, they gave Rett tips, but let him take charge.</p>



<p>“I had to take the initiative,” Rett says.</p>



<p>Sure, there were burnt dishes and some undercooked dishes, but there was also the chance to learn how to learn; a chance to improve by building off his mistakes.</p>



<p>As the weeks progressed, Rett saw his skills develop. He returned to recipes he cooked in the past, and saw how his techniques had gotten better—&nbsp; this family chore had turned into a real-world, edible aptitude test.</p>



<p>Tavenner, a former teacher, saw this “spoon-fed” approach to learning as being a problem not just in her family kitchen, but in the American educational system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So, she created Summit Public Schools, a charter school system with a new approach to education: students have numerous opportunities to improve their grade. </p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>What they don’t have? Assigned homework.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<h3 id="h-a-new-recipe"><strong>A New Recipe&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>It begins with the will to start something new.</p>



<p>“If we want to truly prepare our kids to have a chance to live their best life, we need to radically rethink the education we grew up with, and the message it’s sending,” Tavenner says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep it in the kitchen, think of the traditional public education system as handing students a recipe and the ingredients.</p>



<p>The message is: here’s what you need to know and if you’re successful, you’ll get an “A” on your first test. </p>



<p>But in the real world, things aren’t so straight forward — so, Summit takes a different approach.</p>



<p>Students “have the ingredients, but we must learn how to make the recipe,” Rett, who was also a student at Summit, says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People can help you along the way with learning the recipes, but ultimately you must take center stage. That is what self-directed learning is.&#8221;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>At Summit, students are given the opportunity to change a grade over time if they show continuous improvement. </h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>By allowing students to continue working on subjects to improve their grades, Summit builds in the chance to “fail forward” — to learn from your mistakes. (Like, say, making sure to grease a pan the next time you cook.)</p>



<p>Each student is mentored weekly by an assigned teacher. The mentors stay with students throughout their academic career, providing continued support and offering parents a constant point of contact. According to Tavenner, research has found that mentoring improves a student’s sense of belonging and success beyond grade school.</p>



<p>Those mentors help kids actively engage in their hands-on, project-based work. Through these projects, students may design a house to put principles of geometry to work, grow their own plants, or build a model rocket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Project-based learning is real world learning,” Tavenner says. “Authentic learning. It’s the type of learning where kids are getting really hands-on. They’re asking big questions.”</p>



<p>In addition to its regular curriculum, Summit offers an eight week guided learning program where the students choose the field they’re interested in and get to ask the big questions <em>they</em> want to ask — a freedom not always found in the current public education system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The foundation of all of this is giving students agency and autonomy in their educational journey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When you give kids responsibility, they become invested because they actually know that what they are doing means something and that it&#8217;s dependable and accountable and all of that leads to growth,” Rett says.</p>



<h3><strong>Finding the Ingredients</strong></h3>



<p>While attending Summit, Rett felt he had space to learn — the ability, and responsibility, to shape his learning in ways that best fit him.&nbsp;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>Learning how to learn was one of the central aspects of my learning environment.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>That environment allowed him to explore one of his passions: history. In one class, Rett and his classmates were split into eight groups representing different countries on the eve of World War I. Each country had its needs, goals, and certain rules to follow, but the students had the freedom to interact among themselves.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pushing and pulling against each other made the events come alive: it stopped being just events and dates on a textbook page.</p>



<p>“I think I remember the causes and effects of World War I&#8230;far better than I would have if I were in a traditional environment,” he says.</p>



<p>Summit’s ten West Coast campuses have drawn plaudits from the tech industry, and earned her a seat on the board of trustees at the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. The public charter schools are free to attend, with enrollments on a rolling basis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Summit’s approach to education may not work for every student — and Tavenner says that’s ok. She says asking whether an approach to learning can be applied across the board to <em>all students</em> isn’t the right question to be asking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The question we should be asking ourselves is, ‘does what work? For whom? Under what circumstances?’” Tavenner says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And the power of those three questions is actually asking about each individual student.”</p>

<p>Imagine a city that can glow in the dark, without electricity. One day, this could be a reality, thanks to luminescent materials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Such materials are already being used for emergency lighting, street markers, and decorations. But, someday they could be used to cool our cities, and simultaneously cut down on electricity use.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The cooling effect: </strong>Urban heat islands form because cities are dense concentrations of heat-absorbing materials — like steel buildings or asphalt streets and parking lots. These materials absorb energy from the sun and release it as heat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep things cool, researchers are coming up with complex technologies like <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/radiative-cooling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiative cooling</a> or simple solutions, like covering rooftops with <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/cooling-paper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">white cooling paper</a> or painting them with <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/whitest-white-paint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultra-white paint</a>. </p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;It&#8217;s better for the environment. If the technology can be improved, we can use less energy. It&#8217;s a worthwhile thing to do.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Paul Berdahl</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>But some scientists claim that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-94354-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">photoluminescent materials</a> are an even better bet, because white paint can be more effective when mixed with luminescent materials. </p>



<p>&#8220;You can make [a surface] as reflective as possible. But can you go beyond that? The idea is that maybe you can go a little bit beyond that using persistent luminescence as another way to transfer energy out&#8230;. It is interesting,&#8221; Patrick E. Phelan, a mechanical engineer at Arizona State University, <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/technology/2021/will-glow-in-the-dark-materials-someday-light-our-cities?xid=PS_smithsonian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> Knowable Magazine</p>



<p><strong>Light, not heat: </strong>Researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab explored this theory by making cool colors even cooler. Essentially, luminescent materials release energy as light, instead of heat.</p>



<p>The team, led by Paul Berdahl, an environmental physicist now retired, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927024816301660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experimented</a> with a synthetic ruby, which is luminescent in the sunlight. They found that a surface formulated with the synthetic ruby was cooler in the sunlight compared to a material that was a similar color but didn&#8217;t have the ruby material. </p>



<p>They then tried adding several luminescent materials to concrete. They found that, compared to non-luminescent concrete of the same color, the luminescent materials could lower nearby air temperature by as much as 3.3 degrees Celsius — almost 6 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better for the environment,&#8221; Berdahl told Knowable Magazine. &#8220;If the technology can be improved, we can use less energy.… It&#8217;s a worthwhile thing to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>But luminescent materials would have to cut the heat a lot more than a few degrees to compel people to repaint their rooftops — unless it had a dual purpose.</p>



<p><strong>Self-powered light: </strong>In addition to cooling cities’ outdoor temperature by partially converting energy absorbed from the sun into light instead of heat, luminescent materials could also reduce energy consumption by lighting up city streets and sidewalks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some European towns have already implemented glow-in-the-dark bicycle lanes, and some researchers have looked at utilizing luminescent paint for road markers. Glowing buildings could even reduce the need for streetlights, reports Knowable Magazine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Outdoor lighting <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/slsc/outdoor-lighting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumes a lot of energy</a> — 1.3 quadrillions Btu in the U.S., according to the Department of Energy — so low-energy alternatives like glowing paint could make a difference in some circumstances.</p>



<p>University of Perugia building engineer Anna Laura Pisello wanted to know precisely how impactful luminescent paint could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her lab created a glow-in-the-dark paint and modeled what might happen if they used it to paint a public route near a train station. They discovered that the paint would cut the amount of energy required for lights in the nearby region by <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1343/1/012198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 27%</a> by illuminating the road throughout the night.</p>



<p>But before our cities can transform into glowing energy-efficient environments, there are still challenges to overcome — like maintaining the glow through long, dark winter months or understanding the impact specific wavelengths could have on wildlife.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>This article is an installment of The Future Explored, a weekly guide to world-changing technology. You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.freethink.com/its-the-news-reimagined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subscribing here</a>.</em></p>



<p>The further from land you are, the stronger the winds blow — the <a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/wind/articles/top-10-things-you-didnt-know-about-offshore-wind-energy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most powerful winds</a><strong> </strong>can be found over the deep, open ocean. Traditional wind turbines, even offshore turbines on the coast, can’t tap into this energy. However, <em>floating</em> wind turbines can — and they could be the next big thing in the green energy revolution.</p>



<p><strong>What it is: </strong>Conventional offshore wind farms are located just barely off the coast. They sit on metal or concrete towers that must be drilled into the seabed, that’s why they’re called “fix bottom turbines.” They rarely go deeper than a few hundred feet into the ocean, which isn’t that far from shore.</p>



<p>However, floating wind turbines can be placed in the deep ocean because, well, they float. Or rather, they sit atop platforms that float. The platforms are tethered to the ocean floor so that the turbines don’t drift too much; and they can be assembled on land and then towed to their destination. This setup allows the turbine to operate on the open ocean, where there’s strong wind. Strong winds make the turbines spin faster, which means more power. The power is then transferred to land via undersea cables.</p>

              <h2>These floating turbines are an engineering wonder: in rough waters, the platforms must balance turbines 800 feet tall that have wingspans longer than large commercial jets.&nbsp;</h2>

<p>This all sounds pretty simple, but these floating turbines are an engineering wonder: in rough waters, the platforms <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2021/08/16/climate-tech-watch-floating-wind-farms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must balance 800 feet tall turbines</a> that have wingspans longer than large commercial jets.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why it matters: </strong>If the world has a shot at reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, it’s <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2021/08/16/climate-tech-watch-floating-wind-farms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estimated</a> that we’ll need around 150 gigawatts of additional offshore wind energy capacity — that’s 25 times more capacity than we have today, according to the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation. </p>



<p>Placing floating wind farms in the deep ocean could help us reach our goal — the open ocean has stronger, more consistent winds because there’s nothing like hills, cliffs, or buildings that will slow it down.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Current projects: </strong>The very first large-scale floating wind farm opened in 2017 with the <a href="https://www.windpowerengineering.com/worlds-first-floating-wind-farm-delivers-promising-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hywind Scotland project</a>. Today, there’s several floating wind farms in existence and many more projects are being designed. The world’s largest floating wind farm, the Kincardine,<a href="https://www.maritime-executive.com/article/world-s-largest-floating-wind-farm-fully-operational-off-scotland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> just became operational</a> in October and is now delivering energy to Scotland. It’s expected to generate enough electricity to power more than <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/worlds-largest-floating-wind-farm-takes-another-step-forward.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50,000 homes a year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Norwegian oil company Equinor — ironically, oil companies are the best at building deep sea platforms — <a href="https://www.offshorewind.biz/2021/11/17/equinor-ewp-raise-floating-wind-stakes-in-south-korea-to-3-gw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has plans</a> to build a wind farm on South Korean waters, and Japan <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-29/world-s-biggest-offshore-wind-farm-developer-moves-into-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expects to start construction</a> on one next year.</p>

              <h2>&#8220;In places like Korea, Taiwan, Japan and California, you can only manage a moderate amount of conventional offshore wind, or maybe even none at all, so floating turbines are the only option in the longer term.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Henrik Steisdal, a Danish inventor</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>&#8220;Several countries have big offshore areas close to their population centres, but at depths that are simply too large for bottom-fixed turbines,&#8221; Henrik Steisdal, a Danish inventor working in floating wind innovation, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211103-can-renewables-replace-fossil-fuels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> the BBC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;In places like Korea, Taiwan, Japan and California, you can only manage a moderate amount of conventional offshore wind, or maybe even none at all, so floating turbines are the only option in the longer term.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>The Golden State: </strong>On a national scale, the Biden administration <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-outlines-ambitious-offshore-wind-leasing-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants to have 30 gigawatts</a> of offshore wind energy operating by 2030. That’s an ambitious goal considering that we currently have <a href="https://us.orsted.com/wind-projects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just 42 megawatts</a> of offshore wind energy in the US today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And California is stepping up to help achieve this goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The state has recently <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/05/25/california-announces-historic-agreement-with-federal-partners-to-advance-offshore-wind-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced plans</a> to dedicate parts of the West Coast to offshore floating wind farms — in Morro Bay and near the Oregon state line. The<a href="https://californiaglobe.com/articles/biden-admin-gov-newsom-announce-4-6-gigawatt-offshore-wind-power-project-off-ca-coast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> goal </a>is to build enough floating turbines to have the capacity to produce 4.6 gigawatts of electricity by 2030.&nbsp; That’s more than 100 times the current national output.</p>



<p>Northern California has very strong offshore winds — that, coupled with the fact that droughts and fires, and the shutting down of the state’s nuclear plants, have put enormous pressure on the state’s energy grid — makes floating wind farms an attractive option.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Challenges: </strong>Like any new technology, cost is a big challenge — right now, floating wind technology costs much more than fix-bottom technologies. &nbsp;Currently, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a href="https://itif.org/publications/2021/08/16/climate-tech-watch-floating-wind-farms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn’t expect</a> floating technology to become price competitive until 2032.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, others say the technology is developing quickly and that, once developed, it’s a simple plug-and-play scenario, because a platform design can be used along hundreds of miles of coastline and not require much customization.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&nbsp;California&#8217;s goal is to build enough floating turbines to have the capacity to produce 4.6 gigawatts of electricity by 2030.&nbsp; That’s more than 100 times the current national output.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>“You can literally have one design of a support structure that will be the same for California, Oregon, and Washington,” Alla Weinstein, founder of Trident Winds, an offshore wind technology company, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/11/floating-wind-farms-california-marine-life/620489/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> The Atlantic.&nbsp; “And maybe even Alaska.”</p>



<p>Another challenge is, ironically, environmental. In order for wind farms to generate profit, they need to be large; this means they require a lot of ocean space. Fisheries and whale migration routes may be affected by these farms, and any intrusion of wildlife habitats carries some risk to marine life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As The Atlantic reports, wind farms slated for development off the coast of Rhode Island and Massachusetts overlap with the habitat of the <a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/north-atlantic-right-whale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">North Atlantic right whale</a>, an endangered species.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. <a href="https://theconversation.com/us-approves-its-first-big-offshore-wind-farm-near-marthas-vineyard-its-a-breakthrough-for-the-industry-160747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently approved</a> its first big offshore wind farm — the Vineyard Wind project — to be built 35 miles from mainland Massachusetts. However, getting this approved was fraught with issues raised from local commercial fishermen, who feared the machinery would disrupt their livelihood. While many commercial fishermen recognize that wind power is a powerful tool in fighting climate change, they’re concerned that the tradeoffs — depletion of fisheries — aren’t being recognized.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Ask any scientist what are the biggest environmental challenges facing our planet, and somewhere on the list, they are bound to mention “plastic pollution” and “climate change.”</p>



<p>They’re big challenges, but we may not have to solve each on its own. Researchers at Honeywell International, a chemicals and aircraft parts manufacturer, are tackling them in tandem, with a new method for converting low-grade plastic waste into oil, which they can turn into high-quality plastic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is an “upcycling” process that takes crummy plastic and makes it <em>better</em>, reducing waste and the need for extracting more oil.</p>



<p><strong>The failed promise of recycling: </strong>Plastic isn&#8217;t going away anytime soon. The practical benefits of plastic abound. It is lightweight, allowing us to ship more products with less cost and fewer greenhouse gas emissions. It expands the shelflife of many foods. And some properties of plastic, like insulation or flexibility, can&#8217;t be matched with other materials.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;We can handle mixed plastic waste (and) make it into high-quality oil.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Gavin Towler</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>But, as the waste piles up, our only viable option for slowing down the mounting plastic problem is recycling — even that is limited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The usual plastic recycling process shortens the polymer chain, lowering the quality of the plastic. Each time it is recycled, the quality degrades — a process called “downcycling.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike aluminum, which can be endlessly recycled, a single piece of plastic can only be recycled about 2-3 times before the quality is degraded to the point where it is useless. Eventually, all plastic is discarded, at best ending up in landfills or incinerators (or, worse, oceans) — which means recycling alone won&#8217;t solve the plastic pollution problem. We need other solutions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The big solution: </strong>Honeywell said in a <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/honeywell-introduces-revolutionary-plastics-recycling-technology-to-drive-a-circular-plastics-economy-301413530.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> that their proprietary technology &#8220;has the potential to increase the amount of global plastic waste that can be recycled to 90 percent.&#8221; And, compared to new plastic produced from fossil fuels, their process produces fewer carbon emissions.</p>



<p>The company expects to launch their system, which they call &#8220;Upcycle Process Technology,&#8221; in 2023.</p>



<p>With this new technology, Honeywell will be able to recycle plastics that would otherwise be discarded, such as colorful, flexible, multilayered packaging and polystyrene (styrofoam).&nbsp;</p>



<p>They found that compared to manufacturing the same quantity of virgin plastic from new oil, the production of their recycled polymers resulted in a 57% reduction in CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions. And on the other end, compared to incineration and landfilling (where a lot of junk plastic ends up), upcycling reduces CO2e emissions by 77%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Honeywell also cites a 2020 study published by AMI International, a global plastics industry analyst firm, which said sophisticated recycling technologies like Honeywell’s might result in 5 to 15 million tons of extra plastic trash being recovered each year by 2030.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The caveats: </strong>But, of course, there are caveats to AMI’s optimistic prediction. Certain conditions have to be met — namely, favorable legislation and appropriate sorting infrastructure.</p>



<p>Honeywell is now merging its technology with automated methods to filter through plastic waste and remove undesired elements. Gavin Towler, chief technology officer at the company&#8217;s Performance Materials &amp; Technologies unit, told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/honeywell-touts-process-to-recycle-low-grade-plastics-into-oil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>, &#8220;We can handle mixed plastic waste (and) make it into high-quality oil.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By broadening the types of plastic that can be recycled, UpCycle will revolutionize the plastics economy and play a critical role in improving the sustainability of many of the products we use on a daily basis,&#8221; said Vimal Kapur, CEO of Honeywell performance materials and technologies, in the release.</p>



<p>The benefits of this new technology are still too early to tell. We will have to wait to see if it makes a dent in the plastic problem on a large scale. But the effort could be one solution to two growing environmental problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Graphics processing unit maker NVIDIA has debuted a new way to create AI art. The program, called GauGAN2, can create photorealistic images using a text interface — in other words, type what you want to see and the software generates a picture of it.</p>



<p>“The deep learning model behind GauGAN allows anyone to channel their imagination into photorealistic masterpieces — and it’s easier than ever,” NVIDIA’s Isha Salian wrote in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/11/22/gaugan2-ai-art-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Generating AI art: </strong>The system uses <a href="https://www.freethink.com/science/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep learning</a> to power its AI art algorithm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Deep learning is a specific form of machine learning — where an AI “learns” from large amounts of data — which is modeled after the human brain.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>The AI can create realistic images using a text interface —type what you want to see and the software generates a picture of it.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Much like how your brain uses groups of neurons working in unison to puzzle through problems and generate thoughts, a deep learning AI uses what are called “neural nets” to perform some specific function. Deep learning is especially good at picking out images, or creating them.</p>



<p><strong>Text to art: </strong>NVIDIA’s AI can turn ordinary text into images, which can then be edited or filled out with more details.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Simply type a phrase like ‘sunset at a beach’ and AI generates the scene in real time,” Salian wrote. Adding adjectives like “rocky” and “rainy” will cause GauGAN2 to modify the AI art instantly.</p>



<p>GauGAN2 will create a map of the images (rocks, sun, clouds, sand, water) in the scene, each of which can then be modified and edited by you, either with further text or a hands-on, Photoshop-like editor. This could allow you to take a realistic desert scene and, by popping an extra sun up in the sky, creating a landscape shot of Tatooine (Salian’s example).</p>

</div><figcaption>Credit: Annelisa Leinbach</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The frontiers of AI art:</strong> As <a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/nvidia-gaugan2-text-to-art-tool-shows-ai-could-replace-stock-photos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Next Web</a> notes, GauGAN2 currently works best with simple descriptions of nature.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put in something a bit more complicated, like Tiernan Ray over at ZDNet did, and the end results are <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-absurd-beauty-of-hacking-nvidias-gaugan-2-ai-image-machine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abstracted fever dreamscapes filled with Dali-esque amoebas</a> (more a feature for AI art than a bug, in my opinion).</p>



<p>GauGAN2 is the second iteration of an AI <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/03/18/gaugan-photorealistic-landscapes-nvidia-research/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally released in 2019</a>. The first GauGAN used segmentation mapping to help users create AI art. You could create a landscape piecemeal by drawing it in simple ways, like drawing in MS Paint, and GauGAN would fill in your segments with photoreal images, Ray explains.</p>



<p>NVIDIA says GauGAN2 is the first AI of its kind to be able to interpret commands using multiple methods, or modalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist’s vision into a high-quality AI-generated image,” Salian wrote.</p>

<p>By spreading rock dust over large areas of farmland, we could cause the soil to absorb considerably more carbon from the air, while improving crop yields&nbsp; — a double win for farmers and the environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a paper published in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2448-9.epdf?sharing_token=XokDLkVXz-oWPCOEaRrc_9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0OtB5LS5Y5Cwumoumb5Vs9pGQp7NWqtO_367vUmB4Gw5fODg88EOTaJi1MG6eJBX5eUXorxyzbKsGS5LwVS15Grtx3pS-fhi-4AxWs61e0HQzPqujdvZzk-2nO-Mjq_5gHB1eTEq8fCth6DAiiG1hqK3mOGGl_4QZ_5ZsKq1OsqLWbc0io05ZHeMVSeqSWDHFSShg6F9VI9AOVHw4hk46MauI9JoLQ-d9jiMnxhwdxOLuBzlpUCew1eS1xDCS15yzbV5xumbZdOsUTEDjGUfFPcuP42BKosTEjQUtWtbOa8qS_CisADQzaL-zDTRNFybVo%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.washingtonpost.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, if farmers in China, the United States, and India all gave enhanced mineral weathering<em> </em>a try, we could remove one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere per year.</p>



<p><strong>What is enhanced weathering? </strong>The idea is simple — accelerate farmland&#8217;s naturally occurring chemical reactions by adding minerals in the form of crushed rocks. The chemical processes that break down the stones simultaneously trap atmospheric carbon.</p>



<p>As part of Earth’s natural carbon cycle, rainwater dissolves carbonate minerals in the crushed rock, forming a solution. Then carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in the solution, generating bicarbonate ions. Eventually, these ions form carbonate crystals that can lock in carbon for millennia, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2020/07/08/spreading-rock-dust-ground-could-pull-carbon-air-researchers-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> the Washington Post. </p>



<p>This could be an effective way to make farmland a carbon sponge.&nbsp;</p>

              <h2>&#8220;This is an incredibly exciting technology that has a lot of wins for society and, frankly, we could deploy this very quickly.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Ben Houlton</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Natural rock weathering already <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2019.00007/full#B27" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removes</a> more than a gigaton (one billion tons) of CO2 from the atmosphere each year. Scientists believe we could tap into this process and remove even more — potentially, a lot more. </p>



<p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Scientists generally agree that to reach the goal outlined in the Paris Agreement of limiting global temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius, we need to do more than reduce new carbon emissions. We also need to suck vast amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere and lock it away forever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Various ideas have been proposed for this — from <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/direct-air-capture-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">direct air capture</a> with huge machines to <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/genetically-modified-trees" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetically modifying trees</a> to sequester more carbon to <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/carbon-offsets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">huge fleets of kelp</a> platforms in the ocean. </p>



<p>But compared to the more wild ideas, enhanced mineral weathering appears to be pretty straightforward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The technique would work if rock dust were applied to just about any large area of land, but it is especially effective on farmland because farmers already enrich crops with minerals. They often use broken lime to minimize soil acidity, so they are already prepared with the equipment and know-how to disperse rock dust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding other rocks could enhance soil fertility and crop yields, so it&#8217;s possible that the application may quickly become normal and desired, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/08/spreading-rock-dust-on-fields-could-remove-vast-amounts-of-co2-from-air" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> The Guardian. </p>



<p>&#8220;CO2 drawdown strategies that can scale up and are compatible with existing land uses are urgently required to combat climate change, alongside deep emissions cuts,&#8221; said the University of Sheffield’s David Beerling, a lead author of the Nature study. &#8220;[Enhanced rock weathering] is a straightforward, practical approach.&#8221;</p>



<p>The study found that China, India, and the U.S. — the three largest emitters of CO2 in the world — as well as Brazil, could collectively remove up to two billion tons of CO2 per year by pursuing enhanced weathering on existing farmland.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study estimated that the costs were not trivial (between $80 and $180 per ton of CO2 removed) but similar to or lower than other carbon-capture technologies. And that didn’t count the ancillary benefits, like reducing ocean acidification and improved soil quality.</p>



<p><strong>In the field: </strong>Agriculture accounts for a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions — about <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one-fourth</a> of the total — making it a critical component in achieving net-zero emissions. But farming emissions, like those from <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/sustainable-fertilizer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertilizer</a> and <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/cows-methane-emissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cattle burps</a>, are even harder to avoid than those from electricity, where you could substitute <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/molten-salt-reactor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuclear</a> or <a href="https://www.freethink.com/series/hard-reset/concentrated-solar-power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solar</a> for coal and gas. </p>



<p>Adding rock weathering to the mix could offset a lot of farming emissions that can’t be otherwise avoided.</p>



<p>In a second mineral weathering study, a team of researchers at the Working Lands Innovation Center, a research consortium at UC Davis, has been field-testing the technique for the past two years. They are comparing rock dust and other soil additives to see how well they soak carbon from the atmosphere and store it underground.</p>



<p>​​&#8221;As far as I can tell,&#8221; Ben Houlton, lead researcher with the consortium, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-adding-rock-dust-to-soil-can-help-get-carbon-into-the-ground" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told</a> Yale Environment 360, &#8220;ours is the largest-scale project of its kind, using this intensive sort of scientific approach.&#8221;</p>



<p>Houlton and the other researchers are studying how varying amounts of rock dust impact hemp fields near Geneva, New York. They are among a group of researchers who are testing different rocks for their carbon-soaking abilities, as well as researching their abundance, cost, and safety in the soil. (For example, wollastonite rock is good at sequestering carbon, but it isn&#8217;t common enough to be used on a wide scale.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is an incredibly exciting technology that has a lot of wins for society and, frankly, we could deploy this very quickly,&#8221; says Houlton.</p>



<p>The field trials take a lot of time, and researchers need many trials to understand the benefits and issues with each crop-mineral combination, and with different climates. Initial data from California plots suggest that carbon uptake doubled, despite being in the state&#8217;s driest conditions on record.</p>



<p><strong>What’s next? </strong>Houlton and Beerling both plan to continue their ongoing studies and expect to publish more results as early as next year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beerling is five years into his study, with plans for an additional five years. He told Yale Environment 360, for example, that applying rock dust to fields for mineral weathering may mean that farmers can use less nitrogen fertilizer. This could reduce <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/wetland-restoration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutrient pollution</a>, which would especially benefit areas where runoff drains into the Mississippi watershed. </p>



<p>In the future, it may also be possible for farmers to earn money by sequestering carbon. Earlier this year, the Biden administration suggested that farmers should be <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/29/biden-climate-farmers-carbon-496843" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid</a> for growing carbon-sequestering crops. If a carbon market were to crop up, enhanced mineral weathering could be the key to &#8220;carbon farming.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brian Harris uses technology to help people with brain injuries walk again — but not in the way you might imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Harris isn&#8217;t creating <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/hugh-herr-future-of-bionics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robotic limbs</a> or next-level <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/wearable-robotic-suits-could-be-coming-to-a-store-near-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exoskeletons</a>. Instead, he turns to something more elemental: the rhythmic pulse we can&#8217;t help but feel when we crank up the tunes. Really, it is difficult <em>not</em> to move to the beat of a song.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Harris is making good use of that urge to groove with MedRhythms, an experimental digital therapy that combines sensors and music to help people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease walk.</p>



<h3 id="h-boston-beginnings"><strong>Boston Beginnings&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>When Harris was a clinician at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, he worked with countless patients who had suffered from stroke or brain injuries who were struggling to walk again.&nbsp;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other stimulus on Earth that engages our brain as globally as music does.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Brian Harris</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Harris, a certified music therapist, specializes in something called “neurologic music therapy” (NMT), a growing subfield of therapeutics that uses music and feedback to help train the brain during physical therapy. Following rehab with NMT, Harris says many of his patients’ walking abilities improved.</p>



<p>Time and again,&nbsp; he would see people who first struggled to take a step transform into someone who could get up and walk around the room. When their treatment came to an end, it wasn&#8217;t uncommon for patients and their families to ask Harris how they could continue that type of care outside of the hospital. But Harris didn&#8217;t have an answer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There was nothing they can do, which was an awful conversation for me to have with patients and their family members on a regular basis,&#8221; he says. Since there was no solution for Harris&#8217; patients, he decided to create one. In 2016, based in Maine, he founded MedRhythms, alongside entrepreneur Owen McCarthy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Based upon the results that we were seeing in the hospital, and the demand that we were seeing, we started MedRhythms to figure out how to bring this important care to everybody around the world that we believe needs it, and deserves to have access to it. And the way to scale this is through technology,&#8221; Harris said.</p>



<h3><strong>Beat for Beat&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>MedRhythms gives patients a personalized music DJ that creates a playlist to match their needs as they work through each at-home physical therapy session. Their system uses biomechanical sensors to collect data about a person&#8217;s gait and walking patterns while they are moving, then supplies the beats to match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of simply creating playlists, the MedRhythms algorithm mixes the music in real-time, based on the data coming in from the sensors. The algorithm is meant to curate the optimal music the user needs at the moment. The music has to meet certain parameters, such as rhythmic structure, time signature, and beat salience to drive changes in health and mobility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By mixing music in real-time, users get a customized intervention, moment-by-moment. With all that, they still try to use music that suits the patient’s taste.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of maximizing on what technology can do,&#8221; said Jess Rushing, a music therapist from Colorado State University, who is not affiliated with MedRhythms. &#8220;It&#8217;s really exciting that that team has been able to translate some of what our evidence tells us is effective into a usable product — a prescription of a music application.&#8221;</p>



<h3><strong>The Science of a Rehab Remix&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Music as therapy may sound New Age, but there are scientific underpinnings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The feeling that compels people to move rhythmically when we hear music is called “auditory-motor <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4344110/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entrainment</a>,” a foundational principle of NMT. In essence, musical cues can nudge you to take on a certain cadence. Our subconscious connects our auditory system to our motor system, and when music is playing, the two systems begin to fire in sync, and we can&#8217;t help but walk to the song&#8217;s beat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last three decades, auditory-motor entrainment has been the foundation of a standardized intervention called rhythmic altruistic stimulation (RAS). A growing body of research shows that RAS treatment can <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24284453/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improve walking</a> — including gait, speed, stride length, and symmetry — and reduce falls.</p>



<p>A team at Stony Brook University found in 2019 that listening to music, combined with feedback based on their gait, helped people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease walk better. When patients <a href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/listen-as-this-musician-transforms-scientific-data-into-elaborate-melodies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">listened to distorted popular music</a> as they walked, which would only play correctly when their walking improved, the team saw improvements in their gaits, which persisted even after the treatment ended.</p>



<p>Music is also used to treat many cognitive injuries. Just listening to music engages the parts of the brain that are responsible for movement, language, tension, memory, and emotion, Harris says.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no other stimulus on Earth that engages our brain as globally as music does,&#8221; he says.</p>



<p>Former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in 2011, benefited from music therapy during her rehab. The bullet impacted the left side of her brain, which controls language and speech ability, leaving her struggling to say the words swimming in her head. She suffered from aphasia, the loss of ability to express speech, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/how-gabby-giffords-is-using-music-to-rewire-her-brain-after-being-shot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turned to music</a> to rewire her brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Music is processed all over the brain,&#8221; Rushing agrees, explaining that engaging with music aids in the process of neuroplasticity — the brain&#8217;s ability to adapt by forming new neural connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Music is definitely unique in how it does that. For example, we know that melody is highly lateralized to the right side of the brain, and lyrics are going to be more left side-oriented. If someone&#8217;s had some left side [brain] damage that makes it challenging to expressively verbalize words — melody can access that ability to express words.&#8221;</p>



<p>Earlier this year, MedRhythms launched multiple clinical trials to test their digital therapy: including studies at UMass Memorial Healthcare for acute stroke, Cleveland Clinic and Massachusetts General Hospital for multiple sclerosis, and Boston University for Parkinson&#8217;s disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The studies are ongoing, and they haven&#8217;t published their results yet.</p>



<h3><strong>Musical Breakout&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>MedRhythms’ digital therapeutics aren&#8217;t commercially available yet, but the company has made significant strides. They were granted breakthrough designation <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medrhythms-receives-fda-breakthrough-device-designation-for-chronic-stroke-digital-therapeutic-301076597.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by the FDA</a> in 2020, which will help them expedite the development and review of the therapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also just secured $25 million in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210728005019/en/MedRhythms-Closes-25M-Series-B-Funding-Led-by-Morningside-Ventures-and-Advantage-Capital-to-Advance-Digital-Therapeutics-Platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funding</a>, and even landed a partnership with Universal Music Group, the world&#8217;s largest music label. If the clinical trials prove out, we can expect it won&#8217;t be long before MedRhythms becomes the world&#8217;s first &#8220;prescription music.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;When we think about how [music] globally activates our brain, and engages in neuroplasticity,&#8221; says Harris, &#8220;that&#8217;s what makes it so important in health care.&#8221;</p>

<p>How does one measure innovation? It’s not like examining a stock market index. Should we look at citations? Who inventors claim to have been inspired by? Or is it more of a “feeling”?&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-using-language-to-measure-innovation"><strong>Using language to measure innovation</strong></h3>



<p>One of the more common ways to determine how important a certain invention or patent turned out to be is to review how many citations it received in future patents. While this is a decent idea, it’s got problems. First, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office only consistently recorded citations after 1947, long after many great inventors had done their best work. Second, where we do have citations, they are often incomplete. For instance, an inventor or patent clerk may have been unaware of other similar patents.</p>



<p>These shortcomings are why the team turned to the language describing a patent for their new model.</p>



<p>The model relies on natural language processing techniques to review patents for related terms in the technical explanation included with each patent. If two patents contain shared terms, like “electricity” or “petroleum,” they can be considered at least somewhat related. The novelty of a term, like when it is used for the first time, is also accounted for, as is how often the term is used afterward. The system allows for the similarity of two patents to be measured and for networks of relationships to be mapped — though it turns out that most patents have little to do with each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Using the model, it is also possible to create an “importance measure” determining how substantial an invention was in terms of its being related to inventions that came shortly afterward. This technique was validated when it gave high scores to universally celebrated inventions, such as the telegraph, internal combustion engine, and stem cell technology.</p>



<p>Of course, no method is perfect. This model failed to give high scores to a few major innovations, namely pasteurization and Morse code. However, barring a few slip-ups, the method is able to identify novel and important inventions across American history.</p>



<h3><strong>What were the most important inventions?</strong></h3>



<p>While they don’t provide a&nbsp;<a href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/inventions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specific list</a>, the authors do give examples of inventions that were both novel and set the course for future innovations.</p>



<p>Perhaps chief among these examples was Nikola Tesla’s Electro-Magnetic Motor (<a href="https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/patents/us-patent-381968-electro-magnetic-motor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent 381,968</a>). Before this, there were no patents making reference to alternating current but many afterwards did so. Tesla’s AC motor is also used as the primary example of an invention that causes a “scientific regime shift” — that is, once AC was invented, it became commonplace in electrical technology, increasing the comparative importance of the first patent.</p>



<p>Another invention the authors point to is&nbsp;<a href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_630930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent 4750</a>, an improved sewing machine by Elias Howe. While it is not significantly related to any prior patents, it is closely associated with 16 patents issued over the next decade. Many of these were held by Howe and his compatriots who created the first&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_pool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent pool</a>.</p>



<p>Not all extremely important inventions arose seemingly out of nowhere.&nbsp;<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US493426A/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patent 493,426</a>&nbsp;for one of the first motion picture projectors is closely related to two prior inventions and a dozen more in the following decade. Among them was the predecessor to the modern film camera.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other highly innovative patents they identity include the Wright Brothers’ patent for a “flying machine” (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US821393A/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent 821,393</a>), several related to concrete, many related to antibiotics and their production, all of Enrico Fermi’s patents dealing with nuclear reactors, Robery Noyce’s microchip (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2981877A/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent 2,981,877</a>), and nylon (<a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US2071250A/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patent 2,071,250</a>).</p>



<h3><strong>The history of innovation</strong></h3>



<p>The authors’ method also showed in which industries and when major innovations were occurring throughout U.S. history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1226" height="1203" src="https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-10-at-23.58.51.png" alt="" class="wp-image-24458" /><figcaption><em>The per capita number of breakthrough patents listed by year and industry. “Breakthrough patents” are in the 90th percentile of importance over the decade after issuance. (Credit: B Kelly et al., AER: Insights, 2021)</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As shown, breakthrough tech shifts over time. In the early 19<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, as industrialization took hold, most of the groundbreaking work was in transportation and textiles. Later in that century, electric devices became possible and a number of inventions were produced. Chemicals and petroleum dominate the mid-20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century, while computers have enjoyed the attention of great inventors more recently.</p>

<p>A U.K. hospital is using virtual reality to help parents see the potential impact skull-reshaping surgery could have on their baby’s appearance — helping them make a more informed decision prior to giving surgeons the greenlight.</p>



<p><strong>The condition:</strong> When we’re born, our skulls are made up of several separate bones, held together by flexible material. These joints are called “cranial sutures,” and they give our skulls the ability to accommodate our growing brains.</p>



<p>Cranial sutures typically start hardening into bone around age two, but in <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/birthdefects/craniosynostosis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1 in every 2,500 babies</a>, that process begins too soon. The condition is called “craniosynostosis,” and the most common version is called “sagittal synostosis.”</p>



<p><strong>The challenge:</strong> Sagittal synostosis affects the suture that runs from the front of the skull to the back. Because this prevents the brain from being able to expand sideways, the front and back of the baby’s head can start to bulge, sometimes severely.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;Now, when they sign the consent form, it&#8217;s what I would call truly informed consent.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Noor Ul Owase Jeelani</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Sagittal synostosis typically isn’t life-threatening, but it does have the potential to cause speech and language delays. Even if the only symptom is an abnormal head shape, though, that alone can affect a person’s <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/craniosynostosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-esteem</a> for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>Skull-reshaping surgery can treat the condition, but it can be hard for parents to know whether putting their baby through the ordeal is worth it, especially if they don’t know how significantly it’ll change their baby’s appearance.</p>



<p><strong>The idea:</strong> To help parents make that decision, researchers at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children (GOSH) trained an AI to predict the impact of skull-reshaping surgery to treat sagittal synostosis.</p>



<p>The AI was trained using scans of 60 babies’ skulls both before and after the surgery, allowing it to predict what a baby’s skull looks like after surgery — with 90% accuracy, according to a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59373963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC News report</a>.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;Having the opportunity to do the VR really reassured us that we were doing the right thing.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Amanda Michnowiec </h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>The researchers then developed a VR program they could use to show parents what impact the surgery was likely to have on their baby.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Parents can even give the surgeons input — they might say they think it would be better if the back of the head was less broad after surgery, for example, and the surgeons can implement those suggestions as long as it’s safe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, when they sign the consent form, it&#8217;s what I would call truly informed consent,” Noor Ul Owase Jeelani, a consultant paediatric neurosurgeon at GOSH who developed the surgery used to treat Archie, told BBC News.</p>



<p><strong>The first family:</strong> British parents Amanda and Judd Michnowiec were the first to test out GOSH’s VR system, and they say it helped them feel better about their decision to have son Archie undergo skull-reshaping surgery to treat his sagittal synostosis.</p>



<p>&#8220;Having the opportunity to do the VR really reassured us that we were doing the right thing,” Amanda told BBC News. “Being able to see the ‘before and after’ did relieve that pressure. It was quite a weight off our shoulders.”</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&#8220;When used in a positive way, VR can be a profound benefit to human health.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Brennan Spiegel</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>It’s not clear how many other families have since used GOSH’s VR system, but Jeelani said he’d like to see a future in which systems like it are commonly used to give patients a better idea of what’s going to happen in the operating room.</p>



<p>&#8220;What I would like to see as a surgeon in 10, or perhaps 20 years&#8217; time, is that most surgical practice is done this way where the control, and the power, is very much given to the parents and the patients,” he said.</p>



<p><strong>The big picture:</strong> GOSH’s use of VR to help parents envision the results of skull-reshaping surgery is just one example of how the tech is being used in healthcare.</p>



<p>We’ve also seen VR used to <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/bringing-virtual-reality-to-brain-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">train surgeons</a>, <a href="https://www.freethink.com/series/through-the-looking-glass/depression-in-the-elderly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treat mental health disorders</a>, and provide <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/the-augmented-virtual-human-machine-future-of-surgery-is-here" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relief</a> from post-operative pain. It’s being used to help doctors <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/virtual-reality-future-healthcare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">empathize with patients</a>, encourage people to <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/discoveries/2017/10/licking-salt-habit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eat healthy</a>, and even help distract women from the <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/virtual-reality-help-with-childbirth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pain of childbirth</a>, too.</p>



<p>&#8220;A lot of people think of VR as it relates to gaming and entertainment devices, but when used in a positive way, VR can be a profound benefit to human health,&#8221; Brennan Spiegel, director of Health Services Research at Cedars-Sinai, <a href="https://www.cedars-sinai.org/blog/virtual-reality-future-healthcare.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in 2020</a>.</p>

<p>A Washington-based startup has a <a href="https://www.zevaaero.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radical vision</a> for the future of personal transportation: a flying saucer-shaped <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/airlines-preorder-flying-taxis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electric vertical takeoff and landing</a> (eVTOL) vehicle that will send you soaring across the sky, on your belly like Superman.</p>



<p><strong>Exploring eVTOLs:</strong> By 2050, the proportion of the world’s population living in cities is expected to increase from <a href="https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50% to nearly 70%</a> — meaning their already congested streets are going to get even more crowded.</p>



<p>A number of companies see eVTOLs as a solution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/flying-taxi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electric aircraft</a> take off and land like helicopters, so they could operate from rooftops and parking garages, ferrying people across cities without contributing to street traffic.&nbsp;</p>

              <h2>&#8220;73% of us commute solo, so it makes sense to us that our first vehicle will be designed for a single person.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Stephen Tibbits</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p><strong>Flying solo: </strong>Most of the eVTOLs currently in development are meant to carry two to four passengers, but ZEVA Aero is taking a different approach.</p>



<p>“73 percent of us commute solo, so it makes sense to us that our first vehicle will be designed for a single person,” CEO Stephen Tibbits <a href="https://newatlas.com/aircraft/zeva-evtol-flying-saucer-tail-sitter-superman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told New Atlas</a>.</p>



<p>That first vehicle is the ZEVA Zero, an 8-foot-wide flying saucer-shaped craft that will carry a single passenger across the sky, lying belly-down.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1262" height="966" src="https://www.freethink.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/evtols-5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-24021" /><figcaption>A diagram of the Zero and passenger in flight. Credit: ZEVA Aero </figcaption></figure>



<p>The body of the Zero is essentially two carbon-fiber discs sandwiched together, with enough room between them for the passenger and the aircraft controls (the passenger is also the pilot, though ZEVA wants to make future versions of the Zero autonomous).</p>



<p>Eight propellers lift the aircraft off the ground while the passenger is in a standing position. The props then rotate the eVTOL so that the passenger is looking down, seeing the world below through a window as the craft flies ​​as far as 50 miles with a top speed of 160 mph.</p>



<p><strong>The benefits:</strong> The Zero will be easy to mass produce, according to Tibbits, as the discs for its body can be stamped out using a large press.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even before any savings that brings, though, ZEVA expects the Zero to cost only $250,000 — other in-development eVTOLs have price tags ranging from <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/evtol-air-taxi-passenger-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1 million to $3 million</a>.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>&nbsp;&#8220;We can take off and land in a cul-de-sac, or other places where a 35-foot wingspan is a handicap.&#8221;</h2>
                              <h3>Stephen Tibbits</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>The shape of the Zero also saves on space, which could be key if personal air transport becomes as popular as some expect it will.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can park six or seven of these in the same space you&#8217;d need to park [one of Joby Aviation’s eVTOLs],&#8221; Tibbits told New Atlas.</p>



<p>“And we can land them in much smaller spaces,” he added. “We can take off and land in a cul-de-sac, or other places where a 35-foot wingspan is a handicap.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>Testing phase: </strong>ZEVA has only put a one-eighth scale version of the Zero through flight tests, but is currently conducting tethered tests with a full-sized prototype. That craft should be ready for remote controlled flights within a month, and tests with a pilot could happen in three to six months.</p>



<p>“Once we demonstrate safe flight, we&#8217;ll be categorized as an experimental aircraft, in which case we can begin human flight,” Tibbits said.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>“Now, I definitely don&#8217;t want to jump the gun on that,” he continued. “We&#8217;ll need hundreds of hours on the machine before we put a human in it, and we also need to get our ballistic recovery parachute installed and tested rigorously.”</p>



<p>(Yes, the craft will have an emergency parachute in case of engine failure.)&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The big picture:</strong> Before ZEVA and other developers start flying their eVTOLs in cities, officials will need to figure out how to <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/four-issues-evtol-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regulate</a> this new form of personal transportation and ensure that all the different operators can safely share the sky.</p>



<p>The vehicles will also need to win over the public, and the ZEVA Zero’s design might be a bit harder for the average commuter to swallow than some of the in-development four-seater eVTOLs, which look more like the helicopters and planes that we’re used to flying in.</p>

<p>There are two key considerations when it comes to coding, Greg Brockman, the chief technology officer and co-founder of AI research company OpenAI, told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618128/openai-codex-natural-language-into-code-api-beta-access" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>.</p>



<p>Part one is thinking about the problem, Brockman said, and really understanding it. The second part is figuring out how to solve that problem, using code.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s this second aspect that OpenAI’s new system, called Codex, hopes to make easier, faster, and more accessible.&nbsp;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>Codex can go from text to code, taking commands written in plain English and bringing them to life.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Codex can go from text to code, taking commands written in plain English and bringing them to life. Type in “build a website with a menu on the left side and taskbar on the right,” to tweak The Verge’s example, and Codex will create it, without you having to type in any code. (Now, how <em>well</em> it creates it for you may take some tweaking.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Figuring out how to solve your problem with the proper code language is “probably the least fun part of programming,” <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenAI wrote on its blog announcing Codex</a>; it’s also the highest barrier to entry.</p>



<p>Being able to go from text to code may not only make programmer’s lives easier, it could also open the door for people not fluent in the field’s crucial language — software.</p>



<p><strong>From text to code: </strong>Language is something of a strong suit for OpenAI. The company has built powerful algorithms for natural language processing (NLP) — this is the kind of <a href="https://www.freethink.com/science/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep learning AI</a> that allows Siri to understand you.</p>



<p>Their <a href="https://www.freethink.com/technology/language-generator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most robust AI language generator yet</a>, GPT-3, was a phenomenon in AI circles when it debuted last summer; using essentially all of the written English on the internet as its learning material, GPT-3 is capable of cranking out pieces of writing that are startlingly <em>human</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to OpenAI, Codex is a descendant of GPT-3, except that it isn’t built just on language, but also on the massive repositories of open-source computer code out on the internet — <em>countless </em>lines of code.</p>



<p>Armed with this knowledge base, Codex can go from text to code in a way similar to a conversation. WIRED’s Steven Levy got to see the AI in action, as Brockman and his other co-founder, Wojciech Zaremba, performed a live demo in San Francisco.&nbsp;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>“It &#8230; removes the drudge work.”</h2>
                              <h3>Greg Brockman</h3>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>First, they had Codex build them a website, replete with copy and images, and put it online.</p>



<p>“Then, employing the casual language one might use in conversation, they built a simple game by grabbing web-based images of helicopters and getting them to fly across the screen and blast enemies,” Levy <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-open-ai-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>.</p>



<p>OpenAI says Codex can be used to go from text to code for “essentially any programming task,” although they acknowledge that it may not do all those tasks very well. Rephrasing and tweaking the instructions may be necessary to get Codex to do exactly what you want, and — just like in typing out code yourself — sometimes an unexpected bug or two can slip in.</p>



<p><strong>Not just for beginners:</strong> Being able to create games, apps, and websites in code without knowing it already or looking it all up is obviously a big help to beginners who haven’t done it all before.</p>



<p>But going from simple, conversational text to code would be an immense time saver for pro coders, too. During the WIRED demo, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman mentioned to Levy that Codex can do in seconds what would have taken him a half hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It takes people who are already programmers and removes the drudge work,” Brockman told The Verge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While Levy fears a potential loss of jobs and a cruel irony in people learning to code just as computers learn to do it for themselves, Code.org founder Hadi Partovi thinks automating the boring bits will <em>improve</em> computer science education, allowing us to train dreamers.&nbsp;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>Being able to go from text to code may not only make programmer’s lives easier, it could also open the door for people not fluent in the field’s crucial language — software.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>“As the rote work of coding becomes easier, computer science education can focus on higher-level computational thinking concepts such as designing interfaces, algorithms, and data structures,” Partovi told Levy. (This is similar to how modern art schools work; they don’t teach students how to paint, <em>per se</em>.)</p>



<p>Text to code could be seen as the next step in the streamlining of computer programming, Zaremba told The Verge. What began as esoteric physical punch cards evolved into Short Code, BASIC, C, Python, Javascript, and all of the hundreds of digital programming languages.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“These programming languages, they started to resemble English, using vocabulary like ‘print’ or ‘exit’ and so more people became able to program,” he said.</p>



<p>“Each of these stages represents programming languages becoming more high level. And we think Codex is bringing computers closer to humans, letting them speak English rather than machine code.”</p>



<p><strong>Testing, tuning, and growing: </strong>Codex is still in private <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beta testing</a> since its release in August. This period will be crucial to training Codex to be as competent as possible; the current iteration can only get about 37% of tasks right, Levy reported.&nbsp;</p>

                          </section>
          </section>



<p>Eventually, Codex may not only help programmers, but serve as an interface — it can already run Windows, Spotify, and Google Calendar, The Verge reported.</p>



<p>“OpenAI Codex empowers computers to better understand people’s intent,” OpenAI wrote, “which can empower everyone to do more with computers.”</p>

<p>Genetically modified worms that react to the urine of people with cancer could be used for routine pancreatic cancer screening, helping doctors diagnose the deadly disease earlier, when treatments are more effective.</p>



<p><strong>Pancreatic cancer screening:</strong> Some cancers are easier to spot early than others, and <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/pancreatic-cancer-treatment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a> is on the difficult end of the spectrum. </p>



<p>Patients typically don’t experience symptoms until the cancer is advanced or has spread, and because the pancreas is located deep within the body, it’s hard for doctors to spot tumors during physical exams.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">

              <h2>A cheap, reliable pancreatic cancer screening method could increase early diagnoses of the disease.</h2>
                          </section>
          </section>



<p>People at high risk of developing pancreatic cancer due to their genetics or family history can ask their doctors to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screen them</a> for the disease using imaging (MRIs, ultrasounds, etc.) or blood tests — but the former can be expensive, while the latter can be <a href="https://www.pancan.org/news/new-early-detection-blood-tests-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive <em>and</em> unreliable</a>.</p>



<p><strong>The idea:</strong> A cheap, reliable pancreatic cancer screening method could increase early diagnoses of the disease, and researchers at Hirotsu Bio Science and the Osaka University think <em>worms </em>might be able to help create one.</p>



<p>Researchers have long known that cancer can cause changes in how people smell — this is how some <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/dogs-that-can-smell-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dogs</a> are able to smell cancer in a person’s breath or urine.</p>



<p><em>C. elegans</em> are millimeter-long worms with a naturally strong sense of smell — and with a little genetic modification, the researchers were able to get the creatures to react to the scent of pancreatic cancer in urine.</p>

              <h2>&#8220;The new test could help boost routine screening as urine samples can be collected at home.&#8221;</h2>

                          </section>
          </section>



<p><strong>The testing:</strong> When <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34016888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tested</a> using urine samples from 95 healthy patients and 104 people with pancreatic cancer, the worms correctly identified 57 healthy patients and 88 cancer patients.</p>



<p>A sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 60% is not great — incorrectly flagging 40% of people who don’t have cancer — but depending on the test’s final cost and improvements in accuracy, it may be useful for pancreatic cancer screening for high-risk individuals, letting people know they might want to ask their doctor to run additional tests.</p>



<p>“The new test is not meant to diagnose pancreatic cancer, but could help boost routine screening as urine samples can be collected at home without the need for a hospital visit,” CEO Takaaki Hirotsu <a href="https://www.wionews.com/science/japanese-scientists-use-genetically-modified-worm-to-detect-cancer-430201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said at a press conference</a>.</p>

<p>A cruel reality of opioid overdoses is that effective and safe antidotes exist, capable of restoring respiration and saving lives. The problem is how to get drugs like naloxone to the people who need them, <em>when</em> they need them — when seconds matter.</p>



<p>Researchers at the University of Washington’s Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science, along with their fellow Huskies at UW Medicine, have designed a wearable device like an <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/artificial-pancreas-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial pancreas</a> that can detect the signs of an opioid overdose and automatically inject naloxone, which can restore breathing.</p>



<p>“This wearable auto-injector may have the potential to reduce fatalities due to opioid overdoses,”&nbsp; Shyam Gollakota, professor of computer science and engineering at UW, <a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/wearable-injector-can-detect-and-reverse-opioid-overdose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said.</a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are hopeful it can have a tangible impact on a big source of suffering in this country.”</p>



<p><strong>The </strong><strong><em>other</em></strong><strong> epidemic: </strong>“The opioid epidemic has become worse during the pandemic and has continued to be a major public health crisis,” lead author and Allen PhD. student Justin Chan said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fears of overdose deaths increasing amid COVID lockdowns, economic and social disruption, and the psychological and emotional distress wrought by the pandemic have come to pass in a tragic way.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">

              <h2>CDC preliminary data estimates that over 100,000 Americans died of overdoses in the 12 months after the country locked down in March 2020. </h2>

<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/nchs_press_releases/2021/20211117.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDC</a> preliminary data estimates that over 100,000 Americans died of overdoses in the 12 months after the country locked down in March 2020. The death toll is the highest ever recorded, an increase of 25,000 deaths compared to the 12 months prior to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fatal overdoses were up nearly across the board, as opioid, synthetic opioid (mainly, fentanyl), psychostimulant (meth), and cocaine deaths all increased.</p>



<p>&#8220;Two forces here are the negative economic impact of the pandemic as well as the emotional impact,&#8221; Johns Hopkins associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care Paul Christo told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/11/17/overdose-deaths-soar-record-level-amid-pandemic-rise-fentanyl/8629870002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USA Today</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;That led a lot of people to use drugs&nbsp; &#8230; to cope.&#8221;</p>



<p><strong>AI vs. ODs: </strong>The UW researchers’ wearable, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-01990-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientific Reports</a>, is the latest idea in an approach to drugs called “<a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/rhode-island-harm-reduction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harm reduction</a>.” The strategy aims to reduce overdoses by making drug use safer, with interventions like <a href="https://www.freethink.com/social-change/safe-injection-sites" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supervised use facilities</a>, needle exchanges, and distributing naloxone.</p>



<p>Naloxone can reverse overdoses, but it has to be administered by someone else. People consuming drugs alone are at high risk of overdose, since there’s no one around to call 911 or administer naloxone — something that may have gotten worse in the era of social distancing.</p>



<p>The UW wearable works by detecting when a wearer is suffering from an opioid overdose and then injecting naloxone automatically to reverse it.</p>

          </section>



<p>It is worn on the wearer’s stomach, similar to an insulin pump or <a href="https://www.freethink.com/health/artificial-pancreas-type-2-diabetes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial pancreas</a>, combined with sensors that detect patterns in breathing and motion. When it detects that the wearer has stopped breathing and moving, it injects naloxone using an under-the-skin injection device, developed in a collaboration with West Pharmaceutical Services in suburban Philadelphia.</p>



<p>The prototype uses accelerometers to measure respiration, and a built-in processor can detect the absence of the motions that signify normal breathing. All of that data is sent to an AI, which determines if an injection of naloxone is necessary.</p>



<p>“We have created algorithms that run on a wearable injector to detect when the wearer stops breathing and automatically inject naloxone,” Chan said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How to train an AI to save a life:</strong> Those algorithms need training, however, and to acquire the crucial breathing data, the researchers worked with volunteers in a Vancouver safe injection facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Working with 25 volunteers, the AI was able to learn the respiration rates of people with opioid use disorder. The algorithm could also identify the signs of non-medical opioid-induced apnea, a breathing problem which often heralds an overdose.</p>



<p>The small Vancouver study was only used to acquire breathing data to help train the AI; it did not involve the actual injection of naloxone.</p>

          </section>



<p>Naloxone <em>was </em>injected into volunteers at a second study at the UW Medical Center. The hospital study had 20 volunteers simulate an opioid overdose. While wearing the injection system, the participants first performed two breathing exercises to give the AI a baseline for their breathing.</p>



<p>Then they faked an overdose by holding their breath for 20 seconds; the algorithm recognized their “distress” at the 15 second mark and successfully injected naloxone. Post-injection blood analysis determined that the device got naloxone into their system.</p>



<p><strong>The bigger picture:</strong> While the UW team’s work had previously shown that an AI can detect an overdose, getting naloxone to the user in time remained the crucial challenge, said UW’s Gollakota. The proof-of-concept device could potentially be this next step.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This has the potential to be transformative for millions of people who have opioid overdose disorder.”</p>

<p>No matter how effective the device proves to be — and it will need further training and testing — it won’t save lives if it can’t get to the people who need it. And that means receiving approval from the FDA, which has released <a href="https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/technical-considerations-demonstrating-reliability-emergency-use-injectors-submitted-under-bla-nda" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special guidance for injection devices</a> as it looks to combat America’s spiraling overdose crisis.</p>



<p>“Further work is needed, but this closed-loop system could potentially be transformative if it allowed an unwitnessed overdose to be detected and immediately treated while help was on the way,” Jacob Sunshine, a physician scientist at UW Medicine, <a href="https://news.cs.washington.edu/2021/11/22/allen-school-and-uw-medicine-researchers-demonstrate-life-saving-potential-of-automatic-naloxone-injector-device-for-opioid-overdose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>.</p>

<p>The cosmetics industry has long touted products with supposed anti-aging properties.&nbsp;<em>Slather this cream on your skin and it will turn back your body’s clock!</em>&nbsp;Not content with using that claim just for what people put on their bodies, marketers are now applying it to what people put inside them. That’s right, food is now getting the anti-aging treatment.</p>



<p>What does science have to say about that? Researchers from the University of Washington and Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana recently weighed in on the matter in a review article published in the journal&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abe7365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science</a></em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Three of the most popular diets widely hyped to extend lifespan and delay age-related functional declines and diseases are caloric restriction, where one cuts calories while still maintaining good nutrition; intermittent fasting, which has you take at least a 24-hour break between eating; and the ketogenic diet, in which the dieter restricts carbohydrate intake to roughly 10% of daily calories or less, so that the body produces and utilizes molecules called ketone bodies for fuel rather than sugary glucose.</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>Caloric restriction easily has the most credibility: When scientists reduce rodents’ calories by anywhere from 20-50% , the animals generally live longer and healthier lives.</h2>
                          </section>

<p>All of these diets have been widely studied in rodents. What do the results suggest? Caloric restriction easily has the most credibility: When scientists reduce rodents’ calories by anywhere from 20-50% while maintaining adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, the animals generally live longer and healthier lives with reduced incidence of disease compared to normally-fed controls. Intermittent fasting, with breaks between feeding usually lasting a day or two, also delivers robust results.</p>



<p>However, fasted rodents generally consume fewer calories than unfasted controls, so it’s possible that the anti-aging benefits of intermittent fasting may simply arise from eating less. Lastly, a couple rodent studies suggest a ketogenic diet can slightly extend lifespan and boost memory and motor function, but the reviewers caution that this research isn’t nearly as reliable. Caloric restriction and intermittent fasting clearly come out on top according to the animal evidence.</p>



<p>But should we put much stock in this research when deciding how we should eat? The authors say no.</p>



<p>“Despite their recent popularization, there is not yet strong evidence that any of the anti-aging diets studied in laboratory animals have substantial long-term health benefits in nonobese humans,” they write.</p>



<p>There’s simply no adequately controlled, long-term studies in humans which clearly demonstrate that any of these diets produce longevity benefits.&nbsp;</p>


          <section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="freethink-pullquote">
            <section>
              <h2>There’s simply no adequately controlled, long-term studies in humans which clearly demonstrate that any of these diets produce longevity benefits</h2>

<p>Intriguing anecdotes abound, of course. One of the most enticing is the living example of Okinawans, who inhabit a few small Japanese islands off the country’s mainland. It’s estimated that Okinawans consume about 20% fewer calories than mainland Japanese and get about 85% of their calories from carbohydrates. Historically, they have also had the “longest life expectancy at birth and highest centenarian prevalence in the world, with remarkably low rates of age-associated diseases, such as cancer, heart and cardiovascular disease, and diabetes,” the researchers note.</p>



<p>Still, while whatever the Okinawans are doing seems to be working, the researchers can’t recommend that you attempt to emulate their diet or any of the other anti-aging diets, at least without the guidance of a medical or nutrition expert. After all, these eating interventions can bring about profound biological effects that may benefit some people while harming others. Moreover, inadequate attention to dietary detail may leave the dieter nutritionally deficient. Lastly, humans are not rodents. What works for them often doesn’t work for us.</p>



<p>The main takeaway, according to the researchers, is that so-called “anti-aging” diets are not ready for widespread adoption.</p>



<p>“Although caloric restriction and other diets hold promise, additional data from carefully controlled studies is needed before broadly recommending or implementing these diets, or other interventions, for otherwise healthy people.”</p>
