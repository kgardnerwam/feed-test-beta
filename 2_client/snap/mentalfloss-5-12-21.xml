        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Artist, producer, entrepreneur, and all-around game-changer Walt Disney was born on December 5, 1901. More than a century later, it’s easy to forget that Disney was a real person, not just a caricature or company figurehead. In honor of the man, not the corporation, here are 15 facts about his life.</p><h2>1. Walt Disney played Peter Pan in a school play.</h2><p>The story <em><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74963/12-magical-facts-about-peter-pan" target="_self">Peter Pan</a></em> surely held a special place in Walt Disney’s heart: not only was it a hit movie for him in 1953, it also took him back to his childhood. After seeing <em>Peter Pan</em> on stage, young Walt was given the opportunity to play the Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up in a school performance. Walt later <a href="https://ohmy.disney.com/movies/2016/02/05/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-peter-pan/" target="_blank">recalled</a> that his brother Roy was in charge of the rope used to hoist him over the stage to simulate flying; it was just one of their many creative collaborations.</p><h2>2. Walt Disney was a high school dropout.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>Walt was just 16 when he left school to join the Red Cross Ambulance Corps, wanting to do his part in World War I. But because he was just shy of the minimum age requirement of 17, he <a href="http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/7-things-you-might-not-know-about-walt-disney" target="_blank">forged</a> a different date on his birth certificate. Disney didn’t see much action, however. He was sent to France in late 1918, not long after the armistice was signed that ended the fighting. He still helped where he could, driving Red Cross officials and performing other tasks, before he was discharged in 1919.</p><h2>3. Walt Disney almost sold vacuum cleaners for a living.</h2><p>In 1923, Walt joined his older brother Roy in L.A. to pursue a career in animation. Roy had been <a href="http://www.glamour.com/story/walt-disney-secrets-you-never-knew" target="_blank">selling</a> vacuum cleaners door-to-door to make ends meet and encouraged Walt do the same. Walt considered it, but before he could get sucked in by a Kirbyesque scheme, he got a call from a company in New York that wanted him to make shorts for them.</p><h2>4. Mickey Mouse wasn’t Walt Disney's first big creation.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>In 1927, Universal <a href="https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2016/09/05/oswald-the-lucky-rabbit/" target="_blank">asked</a> Walt and his chief animator Ub Iwerks to create a cartoon character for them; the result was Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Oswald was a huge hit, complete with robust merchandising. With this success under his belt, in 1928, Disney went to New York to renegotiate his contract with producer Charles Mintz. Mintz, however, countered with a different deal: He wanted to <em>cut</em> the budget. And to add salt to the wound, Mintz had been working backdoor deals to hire Disney’s animators out from under him. In the end, Universal ended up with the rights to Oswald, and Disney left New York feeling as if he had lost almost everything. But it all worked out in the end—on the train ride back to California, Disney sketched a character that would eclipse Oswald in popularity: Mickey Mouse.</p><p>The company regained control of the obscure character in 2006, almost eight decades after losing him. The rights were part of <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2324417" target="_blank">a trade</a> between Disney and NBC/Universal: They agreed to let Disney have Oswald back, and Disney, the owner of ABC and ESPN, agreed to let NBC use sportscaster Al Michaels for Sunday Night Football.</p><h2>5. Walt Disney didn’t draw Mickey Mouse.</h2><p>He did at first, but it didn't last long—after 1928, Walt was no longer <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nEGaj75GhXcC&pg=PT76&dq=Disney+Trivia+from+the+Vault+%22autograph+seekers%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg6sLGmu3QAhWqllQKHUknCkgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=Disney%20Trivia%20from%20the%20Vault%20%22autograph%20seekers%22&f=false" target="_blank">animating</a>, focusing instead on story development and direction. He relied on Iwerks and other superior artists to do the drawing dirty work. He never drew Mickey in any of his theatrical releases, and in fact, probably only really drew Mickey when autograph seekers requested it.</p><h2>6. But Walt Disney <em>did</em> voice Mickey Mouse.</h2><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1OziHxAl_A" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>
From 1928 to 1947, Walt was the man behind the mouse—literally. Even after the voice work was officially turned over to Jimmy MacDonald in 1947, Walt <a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/16/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-walt-disney/" target="_blank">continued</a> to do Mickey’s voice for shorts on <em>The Mickey Mouse Club.</em></p><h2>7. Walt Disney drove his daughters to school every day.</h2><p>Despite the fact that he had drivers, a live-in housekeeper, and a number of other staff members at his disposal, Disney took great pleasure in driving his two daughters to school every day. He also spoiled them unabashedly, which historian Steve Watts <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/walt-disney/transcript/" target="_blank">believed</a> was a reaction to Walt’s own stern upbringing.</p><h2>8. Walt Disney had a secret apartment at Disneyland.</h2><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rHuLNHoQxn4" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>
It’s still there, in fact, above the fire station. Walt’s private apartment isn’t typically open to the public, but VIPs are occasionally offered tours. The furnishings remain virtually unchanged from when Walt used to spend time there, including a lamp in the window visible from outside. It’s always kept on to signify that Walt is always in the park.</p><h2>9. Walt Disney's favorite song was “Feed the Birds.”</h2><p>There have been a lot of toe-tapping hits in Disney movies over the years, but Walt’s personal favorite was a ballad: “Feed the Birds,” the song about the pigeon lady in <em><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/58615/18-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-facts-about-mary-poppins" target="_self">Mary Poppins</a>.</em> According to songwriter Richard Sherman, Walt often stopped by the Sherman brothers’ office at Disney on Friday afternoons and requested a personal performance of “Feed the Birds.” "He loved that song, and knew it was the heartbeat of the whole movie,” <a href="http://www.disunplugged.com/2010/03/12/the-sherman-brothers-giants-behind-the-music-of-disney/" target="_blank">Sherman said</a>.</p><h2>10. Walt Disney found golf anything but relaxing.</h2><p>Though many people play golf to relax, Disney couldn't deal with it. After giving up polo at his doctor's behest, Walt took up golf, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=BupsDEZOLYUC&pg=PA44&dq=walt+disney+golf+4:30+in+the+morning&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjCpOXbnu3QAhUprFQKHRdGBj4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=walt%20disney%20golf%204%3A30%20in%20the%20morning&f=false" target="_blank">getting up</a> at 4:30 a.m. to squeeze in nine holes before work. He found the game so frustrating that he quit and took up a more chill sport—lawn bowling.</p><h2>11. Walt Disney felt responsible for his mother’s death.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">
<div id="file-309165" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">

</div>
</div><p>Once he became successful, Walt bought his parents a rather extravagant present: a new house. And when his parents needed something fixed, tweaked, or repaired, he sent his own repairmen from the studio over to take care of it. Such was the case when they discovered a problem with their furnace in 1938. Tragically, his team didn’t take care of the issue properly, and Flora Call Disney <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=41e-Ru0wRkEC&pg=PA303&lpg=PA303&dq=flora+disney+died&source=bl&ots=AWqKDh1d7g&sig=VXy0FahLc3CaEtyO3BZ4cGFuzNQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3v8nSnO3QAhVCqlQKHdq6Dkg4FBDoAQgcMAE#v=onepage&q=flora%20disney%20died&f=false" target="_blank">died</a> of carbon monoxide poisoning at the age of 70. His father, Elias, also fell very ill from the gas leak, but survived. Walt’s daughter, Sharon, said that even years later, Walt found the subject nearly impossible to talk about.</p><h2>12. Walt Disney's housekeeper was a very wealthy woman.</h2><p>Thelma Howard was the Disney family’s live-in housekeeper and cook for three decades. She was hired in 1951 and quickly became part of the family, even making sure the fridge was well-stocked with hot dogs—Walt liked to eat them cold as a snack when he got home from work. As part of her annual Christmas gift, the Disneys <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-24/news/ls-54069_1_thelma-howard" target="_blank"></a>gave her<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-24/news/ls-54069_1_thelma-howard" target="_blank"></a> <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1994-10-24/news/ls-54069_1_thelma-howard" target="_blank">stock</a> in the company. She never did anything with her shares, and by the time she died in 1994, the woman was a multimillionaire because of them. She left nearly $4.5 million to poor and disabled children, and roughly the same amount to her disabled son.</p><h2>13. Walt Disney was obsessed with trains.</h2><p>Walt always had an interest in trains, even <a href="http://waltdisney.org/exhibitions/all-aboard-celebration-walts-trains" target="_blank">building</a> an elaborate model in his office, which he enjoyed running for his guests. In 1948, his hobby grew to new heights when he constructed a 1/8 scale model in his backyard, with track spanning half a mile. He deemed it the Carolwood Pacific Railroad.</p><h2>14. One of Walt Disney's last written communications was rather mysterious—and involved Kurt Russell.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">
<div id="file-309166" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">

</div>
</div><p>Shortly before his death, Disney wrote “Kurt Russell” on a piece of paper. It was later found on his desk, and, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=nEGaj75GhXcC&pg=PT76&dq=Disney+Trivia+from+the+Vault+%22autograph+seekers%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjg6sLGmu3QAhWqllQKHUknCkgQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=%22WALT%20DISNEY%22&f=false" target="_blank">according</a> to Disney historian Dave Smith, the notes were among Disney's last few written words. At the time of Disney’s death, Russell was a largely unknown child actor working for the studio. No one has any idea what Disney was referring to with his note—<a href="http://entertainment.time.com/2013/10/16/10-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-walt-disney/" target="_blank">not even</a> Kurt Russell.</p><h2>15. Walt Disney is <em>not</em> cryogenically frozen.</h2><p>Bob Nelson, the former president of the Cryonics Society of California, <a href="http://www.lamag.com/citythink/askchris/2013/09/05/walt-disney-is-still-not-frozen" target="_blank">makes a good point</a>: if Disney was the first cryogenically frozen man, it would have been a pretty big deal for cryonics, and they would have publicized the heck out of the Mickey Mouse-cicle. No, Walt was cremated and buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale. His gravesite is in a public area for people who want to see it for themselves.</p><p>The chilly rumor may have been <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79702/get-know-walt-disneys-nine-old-men" target="_self">started</a> by Ward Kimball, one of Disney’s famed “<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79702/get-know-walt-disneys-nine-old-men" target="_self">Nine Old Men</a>” animators, who had a wicked sense of humor.</p><p><em>A version of this story ran in 2018; it has been updated for 2021.</em></p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of year again: You're gathering with friends and family. Wrapping presents. And spiking the eggnog with your favorite yuletide libation. That leaves just one thing: the annual holiday movie marathon. Not sure where to start? How about with this list of fascinating facts about your <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/567811/best-christmas-movies-of-all-time" target="_self">favorite holiday films</a>.</p><h2>1. <em>It’s A Wonderful Life</em> was a box office bomb.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">
<div id="file-277866" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">
<div class="content">
    <figure><img class="media-element file-width-constrained-728 lazy cld-responsive" width="728" height="521" src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1555274496/shape/mentalfloss/60792-wonderfullife.jpg?itok=BhQbAqo-" alt="" title=""><figcaption><span class="field-name-field-caption">Still from <em>It's a Wonderful Life</em> (1946).</span><span class="field-name-field-credits">Paramount Pictures</span></figcaption></figure></div>
</div>
</div><p>Though it has become a quintessential American classic, <em>It’s a Wonderful Life </em>was not an immediate hit with audiences. In fact, it put director <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=dcrFjwrD6f4C&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=rko+pictures+lost+525000+it%27s+a+wonderful+life&source=bl&ots=tjb8y0WgB_&sig=yAr9nKZZpv-NV_h38EA0IPiy7sY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iw1hVI-nAc7hsAT6i4KACw&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAw#v=snippet&q=%22it%27s%20a%20wonderful%20life%22&f=false">Frank Capra</a> $525,000 in the hole, which left him scrambling to finance his production company’s next picture, <em>State of the Union.</em></p><h2>2. <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> was supposed to have a laugh track.</h2><p>In the 1960s, it was standard procedure to lay a laugh track over virtually any half-hour comedy, even if the performers were drawn in (<em>The Flintstones</em> was among the series that used a canned “studio audience” to help cue viewers for jokes). When executive producer Lee Mendelson told Charles Schulz he didn’t see the <em>Peanuts</em> special being any different, the artist got up and left the room for several minutes before coming in and continuing as if nothing had happened. Mendelson got the hint.</p><h2>3. Stanley Kubrick Is Partly To Thank For <em>Christmas Vacation</em>.</h2><p><em>Christmas Vacation </em>marked the directorial debut of Jeremiah Chechik, who began his career as a fashion photographer for <em>Vogue</em> then moved into commercial directing. “I had made these commercials that became quite iconic here in the U.S.,” Chechik <a target="_blank" href="http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/16958/jeremiah-chechik-interview-kubrick-spielberg-benny-joon-and-working-with-john-hughes">recalled</a> to Den of Geek! in 2011. “They were very dark and sexy and sort of a little bit ahead of their time in terms of style. And what happened was they gained the notice of [Stanley] Kubrick, who had mentioned them as his favorite American filmmaking, ironically, in a <em>New York Times</em> article.” It didn’t take long for Chechik’s phone to start ringing and for studios to start sending him scripts. “And the script that really piqued my interest was <em>Christmas Vacation</em>," he said. "And the reason is I had never done any comedy—<em>ever</em>.”</p><h2>4. Natalie Wood still believed in santa when she filmed <em>Miracle On 34th Street</em>.</h2><p>Natalie Wood was eight years old while filming <em>Miracle on 34th Street.</em> “I still vaguely believed in Santa Claus,” said Wood, as recorded in <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ShQPhimir3EC&pg=PA63&lpg=PA63&dq=still+vaguely+believed+in+Santa+I+really+did+think+Edmund+Gwenn+was+Santa+natalie+wood&source=bl&ots=IxESCGUHKE&sig=uLn-nTPxcfEHyfbItX-DolM87kU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiPvtvpjMvJAhUi54MKHUKQBNoQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=still%20vaguely%20believed%20in%20Santa%20I%20really%20did%20think%20Edmund%20Gwenn%20was%20Santa%20natalie%20wood&f=false">her biography</a> written by Suzanne Finstad. “I guess I had an inkling that maybe it wasn’t so, but I really did think that Edmund Gwenn was Santa. I had never seen him without his beard because he used to come in early in the morning and spend several hours putting on this wonderful beard and mustache. And at the end of the shoot, when we had a set party, I saw this strange man, without the beard, and I just couldn’t get it together.”</p><h2>5. Ralphie’s dad is never given a name in <em>A Christmas Story</em>.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">
<div id="file-293313" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg">
<div class="content">
    <figure><img class="media-element file-width-constrained-728 lazy cld-responsive" width="728" height="409" src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1555473907/shape/mentalfloss/ralphie_dad.jpg?itok=KvRlZQSq" alt="" title=""><figcaption><span class="field-name-field-credits">Warner Home Video</span></figcaption></figure></div>
</div>
</div><p>Over the years, a gaggle of sharp-eared <em>A Christmas Story</em> fans have pointed out that in Bob Clark’s scene, Ralphie’s dad <i>is </i>given a name: Hal. This is because they believed that in the brief exchange between the two neighbors, Swede asks of the leg lamp, “Damn Hal, you say you won it?” But a quick confer with the film’s original screenplay confirms that Swede’s actual query is, “Damn, hell, you say you won it?”</p><h2>6. “Frosty The Snowman” was a hit song long before it was a TV special.</h2><p>The song “Frosty the Snowman” was written by Jack Rollins and Steve Nelson in 1950 (with a melody that is <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/rFniGuoCBXA">strikingly similar</a> to 1932’s “Let’s Have Another Cup of Coffee”) specifically as a means of capitalizing on the success of Gene Autry’s “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” The record wasn’t as huge as “Rudolph,” sales-wise, but Frosty’s story was nevertheless perpetuated via <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307960382/?tag=mentalfloss0a-20">Little Golden Books</a> and Dell Comics.</p><h2>7. “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town” was also a song before it was a holiday special.</h2><p>Yet again, the song came first. In this case, way first: J. Fred Coots and Henry Gillespie wrote it in 1932, at a time when sheet music outsold records. The song only received national exposure in the first place because Eddie Cantor, Coots’ employer at the time, reluctantly sang it (at the urging of his wife) on his radio show in late November 1934. Despite the music publishers’ dire warning that songs aimed at children were doomed to fail, Cantor’s performance sent the sheet music for the song flying off retailers’ shelves and inspired countless other popular artists to record it.</p><h2>8. <em> Gremlins</em> was intended to be much, much darker.</h2><p>Though some might contend that <em>Gremlins </em>is a pretty dark film, the original script, written by Chris Columbus, was much, <i>much</i> darker. Case in point: Earlier scenes included the Gremlins eating Billy’s dog then decapitating his mom and throwing her head down the stairs. Producer Steven Spielberg, director Joe Dante, and Warner Bros. were all in agreement that they should tone down the gore in order to make the movie more family-friendly.</p><h2>9. Bill Murray improvised a lot of his lines in <em>Scrooged</em>.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div><p>In a 1988 <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.philly.com/1988-11-28/news/26245141_1_frank-cross-scrooged-billy-murray">interview</a> with <em>Philadelphia Daily News</em>, director Richard Donner discussed Bill Murray’s penchant for improvisation and described the experience of directing Murray as follows: “It's like standing on 42nd Street and Broadway, and the lights are out, and you're the traffic cop.”</p><h2>10. Bill Murray was the first choice for the lead in <em>Bad Santa</em>.</h2><p>According to <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/feb/22/news1">The Guardian</a></em>, Murray was actually in final negotiations to take the lead, until he dropped out to film <em>Lost in Translation</em>. Suffice it to say, it was a win-win for both Murray and Billy Bob Thornton.</p><h2>11. Jim Carrey was initially eyed to star in <em>Elf</em>.</h2><p>When David Berenbaum's spec script first emerged in 1993, Jim Carrey was pre-<em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective</em> and <a href="http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-jim-carrey/" target="_blank">attached</a> to front the Christmas film. However, it took another 10 years to get the project in motion, at which time <em>Saturday Night Live </em>star Will Ferrell was signed to star. <em></em></p><h2>12. <em>How The Grinch Stole Christmas</em> almost never happened.</h2><p>Whereas today’s studios and production companies provide funding for projects of interest, television specials of the past, like <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> and <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em>, had to rely on company sponsorship in order to get made. While <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> found its financier in the form of Coca-Cola, <em>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</em> struggled to find a benefactor.</p><p>With storyboards in hand, Chuck Jones pitched the story to more than two dozen potential sponsors—breakfast foods, candy companies, and the like—all without any luck. Down to the wire, Jones finally found his sponsor in an unlikely source: the Foundation for Commercial Banks. “I thought that was very odd, because one of the great lines in there is that the Grinch says, ‘Perhaps Christmas doesn’t come from a store,’” <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/shows/how-the-grinch-stole-christmas">Jones said</a> of the surprise endorsement. “I never thought of a banker endorsing that kind of a line. But they overlooked it, so we went ahead and made the picture.”</p><h2>13. Four plot lines were cut FROM <em>Love Actually</em>.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>Director Richard Curtis initially aimed to include 14 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/11/07/love-actually-s-10th-anniversary-the-cast-and-crew-reminisce-about-the-christmas-classic.html">love stories</a> in the film. Two were clipped in the scripting phase, but two were shot and cut in post. Those lost before production involved a girl with a wheelchair, and one about a boy who records a love song for a classmate who ultimately hooks up with his drummer. Shot but cut for time was a brief aside <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcgcpcjAqbg">featuring</a> an African couple supporting each other during a famine, and another storyline that followed home a school <a target="_blank" href="http://www.afterellen.com/movies/94269-love-actually-has-a-lesbian-relationship-you-probably-never-knew-existed">headmistress</a>, revealing her long-time commitment to her lesbian partner.</p><h2>14. <em>A Muppet Christmas Carol</em> was the first Muppet movie made without Jim Henson.</h2><p>The man behind the Muppets passed away on May 16, 1990 at the age of 53. <em>The Muppet Christmas Carol</em> debuted on December 11, 1992 with Steve Whitmire taking over Kermit the Frog for Henson. The film is dedicated to Henson and his recently deceased collaborator Richard Hunt, who'd long performed Scooter, Beaker, Janice, Statler, and Sweetums.</p><h2>15. A hellish trip from New York to Chicago inspired John Hughes to write <em>Planes, Trains And Automobiles</em>.</h2><p>Before he became a screenwriter, Hughes used to work as a copywriter for the Leo Burnett advertising agency in Chicago. One day he had an 11 a.m. presentation scheduled in New York City on a Wednesday, and planned to return home on a 5 p.m. flight. Winter winds forced all flights to Chicago to be canceled that night, so he stayed in a hotel. A snowstorm in Chicago the next day continued the delays. The plane he eventually got on ended up being diverted to Denver. Then Phoenix. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-nolan/the-early-ferris-bueller_b_256730.html">Hughes</a> didn’t make it back until Monday. Experiencing such a hellish trip might explain how Hughes managed to write the first 60 pages of <em>Planes, Trains and Automobiles</em> in just <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ifc.com/2009/09/there-was-a-ferris-bueller-seq">six hours</a>.</p><h2>16. The plot of <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> was inspired by the collision of holiday store decorations.</h2><p>In the film's <a target="_blank" href="http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/23-things-we-learned-from-the-nightmare-before-christmas-commentary.php">DVD commentary</a>, creator Tim Burton explains that his childhood in Burbank, California was not marked by seasonal changes, so holiday decorations were an especially important factor in the year's progression. When it came to fall and winter, there was a melding of Halloween and Christmas in stores eager to make the most of both shopping seasons. This, he claimed, planted the seed for his tale of the king of Halloween intruding on Christmas.</p><h2>17. The puppets from <em>Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer</em> were rediscovered in 2006.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div><p>When they resurfaced, they did so on <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> in 2006. Well, not all of them—just Santa and Rudolph. A woman who worked for Rankin/Bass had stored them in her attic since at least the 1970s. Prior to that, she let her kids play with them. Rudolph lost his red nose, and let’s not even talk about how Santa lost his eyebrows. The puppets were fully restored after their trip to <em>Antiques Roadshow</em> and have since been displayed at the Center for Puppetry Arts. The new owner <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/23/arts/television/23rudo.html?_r=0">hopes</a> the puppets can go on tour so more people can enjoy them.</p><h2>18. Robert Zemeckis gave his childhood home a shout-out in <em>The Polar Express.</em></h2><p>When the conductor says “11344 Edbrooke” near the beginning of the film, he’s referring to director Robert Zemeckis’ actual childhood home in Chicago.</p><h2>19. The FBI didn’t think <em>It’s A Wonderful Life</em> was so wonderful.</h2><p>In 1947, the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wisebread.com/fbi-considered-its-a-wonderful-life-communist-propaganda#memo1">FBI issued</a> a memo noting the film as a potential “Communist infiltration of the motion picture industry,” citing its “rather obvious attempts to discredit bankers by casting Lionel Barrymore as a ‘Scrooge-type’ so that he would be the most hated man in the picture. This, according to these sources, is a common trick used by Communists.”</p><h2>20. <em>A Christmas Story</em> got its science right.</h2><p><em>Mythbusters</em> tested whether it was really possible to get your tongue stuck on a piece of cold metal. Guess what? It is. So don’t triple dog dare your best friend to try it.</p><h2>21.

</div><p>Though the comedian reprised the role of Ron Burgundy for <em>Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues</em>, he flat out rejected the possibility of bringing back Buddy, even after being <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/19/willferrell">offered</a> a reported $29 million. In December of 2013, he <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/20http:/www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2013/12/18/will-ferrell-shoots-down-elf-movie-sequel/4110793/13/12/18/will-ferrell-shoots-down-elf-movie-sequel/4110793/" target="_blank">told</a> <em>USA TODAY</em>, "I just think it would look slightly pathetic if I tried to squeeze back in the elf tights: Buddy the middle-aged elf."</p><h2>22. <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> killed the aluminum tree business.</h2><p>Aluminum Christmas trees were marketed beginning in 1958 and enjoyed fairly strong sales by eliminating pesky needles and tree sap. But the annual airings of <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2008-10-26/news/0810230187_1_trees-aluminum-color">swayed</a> public thinking: In the special, Charlie Brown refuses to get a fake tree. Viewers began to do the same, and the product was virtually phased out by 1969. The leftovers are now <a target="_self" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/60849/short-life-and-awesome-resurgence-aluminum-christmas-tree">collector’s items</a>.</p><h2>23. Hugh Grant did <em>not</em> want to dance in <em>Love Actually</em>.</h2><p>Though Hugh Grant and Richard Curtis had worked together on <em>Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary</em>, and<em> Four Weddings and a Funeral</em>, they had a deep disagreement on how the Prime Minister should be played. Grant wanted it to be a grounded performance and resented Curtis's push to make the part more whimsical. This came to a head when shooting the dance number, which Grant refused to rehearse. "He kept on putting it off, and he didn’t like the song—it was originally a Jackson 5 song, but we couldn’t get it—so he was <i>hugely </i>unhappy about it," Curtis explained. "We didn’t shoot it until the final day and it went so well that when we edited it, it had gone too well, and he was singing along with the words!" It was a tricky thing to cut, but the final result with Girls Aloud’s cover of “Jump (For My Love)” speaks for itself.</p><h2>24. Richard Donner considers <em>Scrooged</em> the movie where Bill Murray became “an actor.”</h2><p>Though <em>Scrooged</em><i> </i>is mainly a comedy, it concludes with Murray’s character being a changed man, who has to deliver a rather dramatic speech in order to make his character’s transformation clear. But director Richard Donner told <em>Philadelphia Daily News</em> that what they witnessed in that pivotal scene was something much greater: “On the last take I saw something happen to Billy. I saw Billy Murray become an actor.”</p><h2>25. When Neal is thinking about Del on the train in <em>Planes, Trains And Automobiles</em>, Steve Martin didn’t know the camera was rolling.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>In order to get the new ending he wanted, John Hughes and editor Paul Hirsch went back to look for footage they previously didn’t think would be used. Hughes had kept the cameras rolling in between takes on the Chicago train, without his lead’s knowledge, while Martin was thinking about his next lines. Hughes thought Martin had a “beautiful expression” on his face in that unguarded moment.</p><h2>26. Gizmo and Stripe were the same creature at one point in the development of <em>Gremlins</em>.</h2><p>It was at the suggestion of producer Steven Spielberg that Gizmo’s role in the film grew. Originally, it’s the cute little Mogwai himself who transforms into Stripe the Gremlin. But Spielberg knew that audiences would want to see as much of Gizmo as possible, so he withdrew the idea so that they would appear as totally separate characters.</p><h2>27. the Grinch’s green color was inspired by a rental car.</h2><p>In the original book, the Grinch is illustrated as black and white, with hints of pink and red. Rumor has it that Chuck Jones was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zimbio.com/Facts+You+Didn%27t+Know+About+%27How+the+Grinch+Stole+Christmas+%27/articles/R2nZHSi6-dv/Grinch+green+was+inspired+by+rental+cars.">inspired</a> to give the Grinch his iconic coloring after he rented a car that was painted an ugly shade of green.</p><h2>28. In real life, Harry and marv may not have survived Kevin’s attack in <em>Home Alone</em>.</h2><p>BB gun shots to the forehead and groin? A steaming hot iron and can of paint to the face? A flaming blowtorch to the scalp? The Wet Bandits endure an awful lot of violence at the hands of a single eight-year-old. So much so that neither one of them should have been walking—let alone conscious—by the end of the night. In 2012, Dr. Ryan St. Clair <a target="_blank" href="http://theweek.com/articles/469307/diagnosing-home-alone-burglars-injuries-professional-weighs">diagnosed</a> the likely outcome of their injuries at <em>The Week</em><em></em>. While a read-through of the entire article is well worth your time, here are a few of the highlights: That iron should have caused a “blowout fracture,” leading to “serious disfigurement and debilitating double vision if not repaired properly.” And the blowtorch? According to Dr. St. Clair, “The skin and bone tissue on Harry's skull will be so damaged and rotted that his skull bone is essentially dying and will likely require a transplant.”</p><h2>29.

</div><p>By the time <em>It’s a Wonderful Life</em> made it into theaters, more than a half-dozen people contributed to the screenplay, including some of the most <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=FcioAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA401&lpg=PA401&dq=%22dorothy+parker%22+and+%22dalton+trumbo%22+and+%22it%27s+a+wonderful+life%22&source=bl&ots=jHlVvfQlje&sig=gocNN1RQHnCWCW9BbvmxlTpAZsM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=S52TVPf8E8O1sATl9oKoAg&ved=0CFcQ6AEw#v=onepage&q=%22dorothy%20parker%22%20and%20%22dalton%20trumbo%22%20and%20%22it%27s%20a%20wonderful%20life%22&f=false">acclaimed writers</a> of the time, such as Dorothy Parker, Dalton Trumbo, Marc Connelly, and Clifford Odets among them.</p><h2>30. In the Czech Republic, <em>Bad Santa</em> is called <em>Santa Is A Pervert</em></h2><p>Films are known to <a target="_self" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/31192/31-bizarre-foreign-titles-american-movies">change names</a> to fit foreign markets. That’s nothing new. However, sometimes its nuance gets a little lost in translation. Case in point: the Czech Republic’s extremely literal, albeit accurate, title.</p><h2>31. <em>Christmas Vacation</em>’s Cousin Eddie is based on a real guy.</h2><p>Randy Quaid borrowed many of Cousin Eddie’s mannerisms from a guy he knew growing up in Texas, most notably his tendency toward tongue-clicking. But Eddie’s sweater/dickie combo? That was an idea from Quaid’s wife.</p><h2>32. It wasn't until after filming that the producers ofv<em>Miracle On 34th Streetv</em>got permission to use Macy’s and Gimbels' names in the movie.</h2><p>Despite the fact that both Macy’s and Gimbels figure prominently in the story, the studio took a gamble by not getting the companies to sign off before using their names. According to TCM, the studio made the companies aware they were going into production, but refused to share footage until filming was completed. Luckily, both department stores were satisfied with the final product.</p><h2>33. Jean Shepherd makes an on-screen appearance in <em>A Christmas Story</em>.</h2><p>If the voice of the man who brusquely informs Ralphie and Randy that the line to sit on Santa’s lap begins about two miles further back than they had anticipated sounds familiar, that’s because it’s the voice of the narrator, a.k.a. Adult Ralphie, who also happens to be Jean Shepherd, the man upon whose short stories the film itself is based. The woman behind Shepherd is his wife, Leigh Brown.</p><h2>34. Rankin/Bass weren’t the first team to animate <em>Frosty The Snowman</em>.</h2><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TU3SKtJbNu8" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>
In 1954, United Productions of America (UPA) brought Frosty to life in a short cartoon that is little more than an animated music video for a jazzy version of the song. It introduced the characters mentioned in the lyrics visually, from Frosty himself to the traffic cop. The three-minute, black-and-white piece quickly became a holiday tradition in various markets, particularly in Chicago, where it’s been broadcast annually on WGN since 1955.</p><h2>35. Rudolph has a son named Robbie.</h2><p>At least, he does according to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/goingout/2003/christmas/robbiecomp/robbie.shtml">BBC</a>. They developed three cartoons based on Rudolph's offspring, but the name of Robbie's famous dad is never actually mentioned. The plotline tells us that the villain of the series, Blitzen, can't stand to hear Rudolph's name. In reality, it's because the BBC couldn't get permission to use it (or didn't want to pay to use it).</p><p><em>A version of this story ran in 2018; it has been updated for 2021.</em></p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Heavy fogs have long been a part of life in London. In his novel <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/564288/charles-dickens-bleak-house-spontaneous-combustion-death" target="_self"><em>Bleak House</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/548057/facts-about-charles-dickens" target="_self">Charles Dickens</a> wrote:</p><blockquote><p>“Fog everywhere. Fog up the river where it flows among green airs and meadows; fog down the river, where it rolls defiled among the tiers of shipping, and the waterside pollutions of a great (and dirty) city ... Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog, with fog all round them, as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Yet a full 100 years after the celebrated author wrote those words, the city would become enveloped in a dangerous mix of fog and smoke—the likes of which they had never experienced, and were not prepared for. When the smog finally lifted, thousands of people were dead. And it would take nearly 65 years for scientists to pinpoint the reason for what has become known as <a href="http://www.history.com/news/the-killer-fog-that-blanketed-london-60-years-ago" target="_blank">The Great Smog of 1952</a>, one of the deadliest environmental disasters in the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/history" target="_self">history</a> of the world.</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>December 5, 1952 started out just like any other day in London, albeit a tremendously foggy one. But as the day wore on, it became clear that there was something different about the darkness that had descended on the city, which would hang there until December 9. People who were caught outside in the weather found themselves gasping for air, barely able to open their eyes from the sting the smoky atmosphere was delivering. Those who <em>could</em> see couldn’t see very far; as visibility dwindled to practically zero, pedestrians had trouble seeing their own feet while motorists were forced to abandon their vehicles.</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>For several days, the city was essentially shut down. It all began with a cold front, which led more and more Londoners to crank up their coal stoves and gather around them for warmth. While the smoke from the city’s chimneys would normally disperse into the atmosphere, a lack of wind and an unfortunately timed <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20151221-the-lethal-effects-of-london-fog" target="_blank">anticyclone</a> positioned over the city ended up trapping the smoke, which mixed with the fog and other pollutants, creating a lethal atmosphere.</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div><p>“You had this swirling,” funeral director Stan Cribb <a href="https://www.npr.org/2002/12/11/873954/the-killer-fog-of-52" target="_blank">told NPR</a> in 2002, “like somebody had set a load of car tires on fire.” Cribb, who at the time was working as a mortician’s assistant, was on his way to a wake with his uncle—who was also his boss—with a line of mourners behind them. According to NPR:</p><blockquote><p>Neither man knew a catastrophe was brewing. They didn't know that a mass of stagnant air had just clamped a lid over London, trapping the smoke from millions of residential coal fires at ground level.</p>
<p>Cribb remembers being stunned by the blackness of the gathering fog. After a few minutes he couldn't see the curb from his spot behind the wheel. After a few more minutes, Tom Cribb got out and started walking in front of the hearse, to keep his nephew on the road. He carried a powerful hurricane lantern in one hand, but it was useless.</p>
<p>“It's like you were blind,” says Cribb.</p>
</blockquote><p>When the fog finally lifted, reports estimated that at least 4000 people had been killed and 150,000 were hospitalized, though in the years since the total death toll has risen to approximately 12,000.</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div><p>Fans of the Netflix series <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/610984/the-crown-tv-series-facts" target="_self"><em>The Crown</em></a> will likely remember the season 1 episode in which <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/94258/25-regal-facts-about-queen-elizabeth-ii" target="_self">Queen Elizabeth</a> and then-Prime Minister <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/635842/winston-churchill-facts" target="_self">Winston Churchill</a> were forced to contend with the deadly event. (Of course, always aiming for accuracy, director Stephen Daldry told <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> that they weren’t about to use CGI to recreate The Great Smog. “We had to get a great, huge warehouse and fill it full of fog to create the great pea soup of 1952,” <a href="https://time.com/4554972/great-smog-london-crown-netflix/" target="_blank">Daldry said</a>. “We did it for real—CG didn’t look good enough for us.”)</p><p>Amazingly, it wasn't until 2016 that a global team of scientists announced that they may have finally solved the mystery of The Great Smog, and published their findings in the November 2016 issue of <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</em> (PNAS).</p><p>“People have known that sulfate was a big contributor to the fog, and sulfuric acid particles were formed from sulfur dioxide released by coal burning for residential use and power plants, and other means,” Dr. Renyi Zhang, a professor at Texas A&M University and one of the paper’s lead authors, <a href="http://today.tamu.edu/2016/11/14/researchers-solve-mystery-of-historic-1952-london-fog-and-current-chinese-haze/" target="_blank">said</a>. “But how sulfur dioxide was turned into sulfuric acid was unclear. Our results showed that this process was facilitated by nitrogen dioxide, another co-product of coal burning, and occurred initially on natural fog. Another key aspect in the conversion of sulfur dioxide to sulfate is that it produces acidic particles, which subsequently inhibits this process. Natural fog contained larger particles of several tens of micrometers in size, and the acid formed was sufficiently diluted. Evaporation of those fog particles then left smaller acidic haze particles that covered the city.”</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>In addition to helping to solve a troubling environmental disaster that had confounded scientists for decades, Zhang and his colleagues’ research is also helping to determine how to best deal with similar air pollution problems today, including those faced by several cities in China, which is home to some of the world’s most polluted cities.</p><p>“The difference in China is that the haze starts from much smaller nanoparticles, and the sulfate formation process is only possible with ammonia to neutralize the particles,” Zhang said. “In China, sulfur dioxide is mainly emitted by power plants, nitrogen dioxide is from power plants and automobiles, and ammonia comes from fertilizer use and automobiles. Again, the right chemical processes have to interplay for the deadly haze to occur in China. Interestingly, while the London fog was highly acidic, contemporary Chinese haze is basically neutral.”</p><p>“The government has pledged to do all it can to reduce emissions going forward, but it will take time,” he added. “We think we have helped solve the 1952 London fog mystery and also have given China some ideas of how to improve its air quality. Reduction in emissions for nitrogen oxides and ammonia is likely effective in disrupting this sulfate formation process.”</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>Though it would be hard to call it a silver lining, The Great Smog of 1952 did have one positive effect: it forced the country’s government, and its people, to become more aware of the impact their actions had on their environment. On July 5, 1956, less than four years after London was enveloped in a lethal darkness, the Queen enacted the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/4-5/52/enacted" target="_blank">Clean Air Act 1956</a>, which banned the burning of pollutants across the UK.</p><p><em>A version of this story ran in 2017; it has been updated for 2021.</em></p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After moving into a new living space, many people's next stop is <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67067/14-ready-assemble-facts-about-ikea" target="_self">IKEA</a>. The Swedish home goods chain is known for making furniture that's stylish, functional, and affordable. Now, customers can skip a step in the moving process and rent an apartment straight from the retailer. As <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tiny-apartment-home-house-ikea-japan-renting-tokyo-photos-shinjuku-2021-12#a-life-sized-version-of-ikeas-popular-toy-shark-blahaj-is-helming-ikea-japans-promotional-real-estate-office-16" target="_blank">Insider reports</a>, IKEA is renting out a tiny apartment in Tokyo for the unbeatable price of less than $1 a month.</p><p>IKEA is using the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/design/ikea-japan-tiny-apartment-1dollar-month-tokyo-11-26-2021/" target="_blank">micro apartment</a> to showcase how well its products fit into small spaces. Located in the Shinjuku neighborhood of the Japanese capital, the apartment comprises 107 square feet spread over two levels. On the first floor, residents can work at a compact desk that converts into a dining table, or lounge in a mini corner sofa that converts into a bed. There's also a kitchenette, <a href="https://www.simplemost.com/see-inside-ikeas-tiny-homes-rent-japan/" target="_blank">washing machine</a>, and a bathroom with a shower and toilet.</p><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

</div>
</div><p>Up the stepladder, apartment dwellers will find a cozy loft bed. It's nestled next to a set of drawers that transform the upper floor into a complete bedroom space. IKEA provided <a href="https://www.timeout.com/tokyo/news/you-can-rent-a-mini-studio-apartment-in-tokyo-designed-by-ikea-for-just-99-a-month-112521" target="_blank">furniture</a> that would optimize the limited square footage. Some of the most convenient items include a modular shelving unit that extends up to the second level and a table on wheels that can be easily relocated to suit the space.</p><p>The sleek furnishings are a nice perk, but the most appealing aspect of the apartment is the price. IKEA is offering it for just ¥99, or roughly $.86 USD. That includes the furniture, though the tenants will still have to cover the full utilities and cost of moving. IKEA is looking for members of its <a href="https://www.ikea.com/jp/en/ikea-family/" target="_blank">Family membership program</a> to live in the apartment from December 15, 2021, until January 15, 2023.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Driving beside an <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/28155/how-jayne-mansfield-changed-design-tractor-trailers" target="_self">18-wheeler</a> can be a little nerve-racking in general—a feeling compounded when you realize some of its wheels are covered in spikes. Are those menacing ornaments just meant to scare you, or do they serve a purpose?</p><p>Actually, the two aren’t mutually exclusive: The spikes <em>are</em> sort of meant to scare you. But it’s for your own good (and the good of everyone around you). As <a href="https://bigrigpros.com/why-do-semi-trucks-have-spikes-on-wheels/" target="_blank">Big Rig Pros explains</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/540211/11-secrets-truck-drivers" target="_self">truck drivers</a> have significant blind spots along the sides and back of their trucks, and accidents are more likely to happen when an approaching vehicle strays into one of these so-called “no-zones.” The spikes are a wordless way to catch people’s attention and encourage them—in a slightly intimidating manner—to keep a safe distance between their vehicle and the big rig.</p><p>If you do accidentally drift too close and brush up against the barbs, don’t panic. According to <a href="https://thenewswheel.com/semi-truck-hubcap-spikes-decorative-or-dangerous/" target="_blank">The News Wheel</a>, they’re usually made from either plastic or weak aluminum—so they can scratch up your <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/cars" target="_self">car</a>’s siding, but they won’t likely rip right through it. (Not that you should take that as a challenge to hug the side of a semi.)</p><p>The spikes are more than sturdy enough to serve their main purpose as lug nut covers. Considering the countless miles that 18-wheelers cover, it’s no surprise that their lug nuts—which help fasten tires to their axles—suffer more wear and tear than those of other automobiles. The spikes shield them from dirt and keep them dry from precipitation, forestalling rust and preventing them from loosening.</p><p>Could flat covers do this job just as well? Probably. But not only do the pointed ones have that safety-oriented intimidation factor—they also look flashy. And when you’re spending dozens of hours a week in your truck, you might be inclined to trick it out a little. As Big Rig Pros notes, it’s not unlike an office employee decorating their cubicle.</p><p><em>Have you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer?

</div><p>Topps trading cards were <em>the</em> essential collectible during the ‘70s, ‘80s, and ‘90s—so it was only right that <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84877/20-enterprising-facts-about-star-trek" target="_self"><em>Star Trek</em></a> would have its own set for fans to obsess over (though it actually debuted seven years after the original series was canceled).

</div><p>One of the most striking aspects of the sci-fi genre is the imaginative, if not downright weird, book covers that come along with it. This collection of postcards features reproductions of 100 covers from publisher Penguin’s past, featuring work from H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, J. G. Ballard, Philip K. Dick, Kurt Vonnegut, and Ray Bradbury.

</div><p>Some of sci-fi’s best women writers get the spotlight in this expansive anthology collection from the Library of America. The stories themselves range from the campier pulps of the '20 and '30s through the more thoughtful and serious evolution of the genre in the ‘60s. This is a crash course in sci-fi history, told through the lens of an often-unappreciated group of authors, including James Tiptree, Jr. (real name Alice Bradley Sheldon) and Leigh Brackett, who was responsible for the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/623697/original-star-wars-empire-strikes-back-script-changes" target="_self">first draft</a> of 1980's <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em>.</p><p><strong>Buy it:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Classic-Science-Fiction-Stories-Pioneers/dp/1598535803/?tag=mf-sci-fi-20" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p><h2>7. <em>Godzilla: The Showa-Era Films</em>; $112</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728">

And in this handsome, 15-movie Blu-ray set from Criterion, fans can revisit the series’s most influential installments, from 1954's groundbreaking original all the way through the campier later days of Megalon and Mechagodzilla. The set also contains both the U.S. and Japanese versions of 1963’s cringe classic <em>King Kong vs. Godzilla</em>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>December is finally here, and there are so many new <a href="https://mentalfloss.com/section/netflix" target="_self">Netflix</a> shows to watch throughout the final month of the year. There’s truly something for everyone. Below, we shared a list of the 10 best Netflix shows to watch on Netflix in December.</p><h2>1.<em> Lost in Space</em> Season 3 // December 1</h2><p><em>Lost in Space</em> season 3 is finally here.

Unfortunately, this is the final season of the hit show. How will it all end for Will, the Robinsons, and Robot? You’ll have to watch to find out.</p><h2>2. <em>Money Heist</em> Season 5, Part 2 // December 3</h2><p><em>Money Heist</em> season 5, part 2 premieres on the platform the first weekend of December 2021.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Whopper celebrates its 64th birthday this weekend, and Burger King is celebrating by throwing its menu back to the 1950s. As <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/02/business/burger-king-whopper-original-price/index.html" target="_blank">CNN reports</a>, the iconic burger is selling for its original price of $.37 on Friday, December 3 and Saturday, December 4—but ordering one won't be as easy as walking up to the counter.</p><p>Burger King <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/burger-king-whopper-facts/" target="_blank">debuted its Whopper sandwich</a> at its flagship location in Miami, Florida, in 1957. In his autobiography, the burger's co-creator Jim McLamore said that he wanted the name to "convey imagery of something big" after noting people's fondness for oversized meat patties. Shortly after launching the new menu item, Burger King erected signs declaring itself "the Home of the Whopper," and the flame-grilled burger became a symbol of the brand.</p><p>To take advantage of <a href="https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/burger-king-offering-37-cent-whoppers-for-2-days-only/" target="_blank">Burger King's anniversary deal</a>, you need to become a <a href="https://www.bk.com/bkrewards" target="_blank">Royal Perks rewards</a> member.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On May 6, 1954, Oxford student <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/first-four-minute-mile" target="_blank">Roger Bannister</a> became the first runner to break the 4-minute mile barrier, a feat then considered a physical impossibility.</p><p>On July 29, 2021, another imagined physical limit was breached. Neville Sharp earned a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66380/10-superlative-facts-about-guinness-world-records" target="_self">Guinness World Record</a> for the world’s loudest male burp, breaking a <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2021/11/loudest-burp-record-broken-for-first-time-in-over-a-decade-683953" target="_blank">record</a> that had stood for a decade.</p><p>Sharp, who lives in Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia, belched at an <a href="https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2021/12/01/australia-Guinness-World-Records-loudest-burp/5381638384804/?u3L=1" target="_blank">astounding</a> 112.4 decibels. For <a href="https://www.iacacoustics.com/blog-full/comparative-examples-of-noise-levels.html" target="_blank">comparison</a>, a chainsaw might roar at 120 decibels; a garbage disposal is 80 decibels. Humans typically begin to experience pain while exposed to 110 decibels.</p><p>Listen to some of Sharp's more robust efforts:</p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7w-5M6dS8TM" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>

Sharp, who said he was motivated to best Englishman Paul Hunn’s 2009 record of 109.9 decibels because “the record has been held by an Englishman for over 10 years,” practiced for five years for the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/49118/11-really-bizarre-world-records" target="_self">strange feat</a>. He was taught to belch productively by his sister and began doing so at the age of 6, proving that it’s often necessary for many great athletes to start early.</p><p>Guinness also recognizes Elisa Cagnoni for the world’s loudest women’s burp. Cagnoni, of Italy, let out a 107-decibel roar in 2009.</p><p><em>[h/t <a href="https://www.upi.com/Odd_News/2021/12/01/australia-Guinness-World-Records-loudest-burp/5381638384804/?u3L=1" target="_blank">United Press International</a>]</em></p>

                <description><![CDATA[The first thing you notice about giant African land snails is that they're ginormous. The second thing is that they're not limited to Africa.]]></description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are about 43,000 <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210204184741/http://www.molluscs.at/gastropoda/index.html?/gastropoda/main.html" target="_blank">living snail species</a>. Three of them have become invasive pests in <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2019-08-23/Experts-warn-of-harmful-giant-snails-in-southern-China-Jo0J3dO4bC/index.html" target="_blank">China</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19077138" target="_blank">Colombia</a>, <a href="https://india.mongabay.com/2019/08/kodagu-coffee-planters-take-on-giant-snail-invasion" target="_blank">India</a>, <a href="https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/feature-barbados-making-strides-against-the-giant-african-snail/" target="_blank">Barbados</a>, <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/we-made-it-only-two-days-new-year-species-went-extinct" target="_blank">Hawaii</a>, and many other corners of the world: <em>Achatina achatina</em>, <em>Archachatina marginata</em>, and <em>Lissachatina fulica</em> (a.k.a. <em>Achatina fulica</em>)—a trio better known as <a href="https://www.in.gov/dnr/entomology/regulatory-information/giant-african-land-snails/" target="_blank">giant African land snails</a>. Native to East Africa, the snails can do a lot of damage when they’re introduced to foreign habitats. Here’s what you need to know about these monster mollusks.</p><h2>1. Giant African land snail shells can be as big as a man’s fist.</h2><p>Whorled, striped, and brownish overall, the shells can measure up to 8 inches long and nearly 5 inches in diameter. According to the <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/giant-african-snail/giant-african-snail" target="_blank">USDA</a>’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, that’s “about the size of an average [human] adult fist.”</p><h2>2. Oblivious pet owners helped the giant African land snails spread around the world.</h2><p>India’s giant African <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0143724" target="_blank">land snail problem</a> began in 1847. Some of the pioneering snails were probably <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/study-finds-repeated-waves-of-giant-african-snail-invasion-in-kerala/article33262455.ece" target="_blank">hitchhikers</a> that entered the subcontinent on shipments of timber. Others got an assist from exotic animal-lovers; a blacksmith who reportedly kept <em>L. fulica</em> as pets may have helped them invade the Indian state of Bihar during the 1960s.</p><p>Giant African land snails made their way to Florida in 1966, when a boy brought three of the snails home from a trip to Hawaii, where they were already invasive. His grandmother later <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/planthealth/plant-pest-and-disease-programs/pests-and-diseases/giant-african-snail" target="_blank">set them free</a>.</p><h2>3. Invasive giant African land snails are bad news for farmers.</h2><p>Peanuts, cucumbers, cocoa, and peas are just some of the commercial crops that giant African land snails devour. They can eat <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210411025139/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/cerc/danoff-burg/invasion_bio/inv_spp_summ/Achatina_fulica.htm" target="_blank">over 500 kinds of plants</a>, including lichens, algae, and fungi.</p><h2>4. Stucco and concrete are also on the giant African land snails’ menu.</h2><p>Giant African land snails may be predominantly herbivorous, but their shells need a steady supply of <a href="https://www.africanlandsnails.com/diet" target="_blank">calcium</a> to grow. To get it, the snails feed on bones, eggshells, oyster shells, and the shells of <a href="https://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Achatina_fulica/#food_habits" target="_blank">other snails</a>. They’ll even eat <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/07/15/331716061/u-s-customs-seize-giant-african-snails-bound-for-dinner-plates" target="_blank">human-made calcium sources</a> like stucco, concrete, and paint—much to the horror of homeowners.</p><h2>5. Giant African land snails can carry dangerous parasites.</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/gen_info/faqs.html" target="_blank">rat lungworm</a> (<em>Angiostrongylus cantonensis</em>) uses snails to complete its life cycle. The adult worms both live and reproduce inside common <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/angiostrongylus/biology_can.html" target="_blank">rat species</a>, such as black, brown, and cotton rats. The worm’s larvae end up in the host mammal’s poop and are eventually excreted. The feces are then eaten by scavenging snails. If one of the worm-carrying snails is later eaten by a rodent, the cycle continues.</p><p>A 2015 survey of 50 <em>L. fulica</em> snails collected in Miami found that 18 of them <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25973628/" target="_blank">harbored rat lungworms</a>. The worms can cause eosinophilic meningitis in humans who eat the snails, either as part of a meal or by accidentally ingesting parts of the snails on grocery store produce. The illness can be fatal.</p><h2>6. Giant African land snails are hermaphroditic.</h2><p>The giant snails have female and male <a href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/giant-african-snail/giant-african-snail" target="_blank">reproductive organs</a> and are prolific breeders. One instance of mating can fertilize <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211121031804/http://nyis.info/invasive_species/giant-african-land-snail/" target="_blank">several clutches</a> of eggs over a period of time. Because a single snail can produce 1200 eggs per year, giant African land snails can take over an environment quickly.</p><h2>7. Giant African land snails can flatten your tires.</h2><p>Run over these invertebrates at your own risk. Their tough, sharp shells can <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-22155219" target="_blank">blow out car tires</a>—or turn into flying shrapnel when accidentally crushed by a lawnmower.</p><h2>8. It took seven years and $1 million to get rid of giant African land snails in Florida …</h2><p>Following their accidental introduction in 1966, giant African land snails practically took over south Florida. The state spent <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/florida-spent-over-24m-eradicating-invasive-snails-that-damage-homes-1636622" target="_blank">more than $1 million</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Bibliografia_Sobre_Moluscos_Como_Plaga_E/COMOAQAAIAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=giant+land+snails+eradicated+florida+1975&pg=PA40&printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">surveyed</a> nearly a million properties to find and eliminate them. The effort paid off: Over the next seven years, more than 18,000 specimens were wiped out. In 1975, Florida’s Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services announced that the invasive giant snails had been fully eradicated [<a href="https://www.fdacs.gov/ezs3download/download/25070/515986/pdf_2010_giant_african_snail_survey_report_03-11-2010.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>].</p><h2>9. … But the giant African land snails weren’t done with the Sunshine State.</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.evergladescisma.org/the-dirty-dozen/giant-african-land-snail/" target="_blank">snails came back</a> in 2011, likely in an illegal shipment intended for religious purposes. They first popped up in Miami-Dade County, then spread into neighboring Broward County. This time around, the state spent more than $24 million to get rid of them, and no new sightings have been reported in Florida <a href="https://www.livescience.com/giant-african-land-snail-eradicated-florida" target="_blank">since 2017</a>. In October 2021, the snails were again <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/10/06/giant-africa-land-snails-eradicated-florida/" target="_blank">declared eradicated</a> by the state’s agriculture commissioner.</p><h2>10. Trained dogs helped find the giant African land snails.</h2><p><a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/05/23/black-labs-graduate-giant-african-snail-sniffing-school/" target="_blank">Labrador retrievers</a> trained by the USDA were enlisted to sniff out the invasive pests. Some dogs found <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2014/05/23/black-labs-graduate-giant-african-snail-sniffing-school/" target="_blank">literally hundreds</a> of the snails per week. Assisted by the puppers, Florida officials were able to find and eliminate more than 168,000 snails in the state’s most recent campaign.</p>

                <description><![CDATA[The Fab Four wanted to try their hand at adapting the works of J.R.R. Tolkien back in 1968—unfortunately, the author wasn't looking to have a pop group bring Middle-earth to life.]]></description>
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While Peter Jackson's <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73331/20-epic-facts-about-lord-rings-trilogy" target="_self"><em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy</a> is one of the most critically acclaimed film series of all time, it could’ve turned out completely different. Before the likes of Elijah Wood and Viggo Mortensen were cast, familiar faces such as Liam Neeson, Uma Thurman, and even Vin Diesel were considered for roles. And prior to Jackson’s take on <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59736/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-jrr-tolkien" target="_self">J.R.R. Tolkien</a>’s work, a certain group of mop-topped pop stars tried to get an adaptation going.</p><p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/51566/11-fun-facts-about-beatles" target="_self">The Beatles</a>, of all people, wanted to star in a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movie once upon a time after film producer Denis O'Dell presented them with the idea back in the late '60s. This all comes from Jackson himself, who relayed the story while promoting his new Disney+ documentary <em>Get Back</em>, which is all about the iconic band.</p><h2>J.R.R. Tolkien turned down The Beatles</h2><p>According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59387182" target="_blank">BBC</a>, Jackson had the chance to ask Paul McCartney about this story while working on <em>Get Back</em>, discovering that while The Beatles wanted to make the movie, it was <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/biographies/authors/626661-jrr-tolkien-biography-facts-books-quotes-and-movie" target="_self">Tolkien</a> himself who turned the idea down. Jackson explained:</p><blockquote><p><em>"Ultimately, they couldn’t get the rights from Tolkien, because he didn’t like the idea of a pop group doing his story. So it got nixed by him. They tried to do it. There’s no doubt about it. For a moment in time they were seriously contemplating doing that at the beginning of 1968."</em></p>
</blockquote><p>Rumor has it that McCartney would have played Frodo, George Harrison would’ve portrayed Gandalf, Ringo Starr would’ve been Sam, and, funnily enough, John Lennon would have played Gollum. “Paul couldn’t remember exactly when I spoke to him, but I believe that is the case,” Jackson said.</p><p>It goes without saying that a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movie starring The Beatles would have been much different than the trilogy we eventually got. But even McCartney realized things turned out fine in the end. As Jackson recalled, “Paul said, ‘Well I’m glad we didn’t do it, because you got to do yours and I liked your film.'”</p><p>The next attempt at a Middle-earth adaptation will come when Amazon's <em>Lord of the Rings</em> TV series makes its September 2022 debut.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="https://bookriot.com/booktube-according-to-booktubers/" target="_blank">BookTubers</a> and <a href="https://www.oprahdaily.com/entertainment/books/g25995339/best-book-instagram-accounts/" target="_blank">Bookstagrams</a> to the latest trend of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/jun/25/the-rise-of-booktok-meet-the-teen-influencers-pushing-books-up-the-charts" target="_blank">BookTok accounts</a> on TikTok, more people are using social media to get into reading and help titles and authors gain popularity.</p><p>So much so, in fact, that <a href="https://www.theknowledgeacademy.com/" target="_blank">The Knowledge Academy</a> conducted a study to determine which books and authors were the most popular on TikTok. Researchers looked at just under 200 books, as sourced from Book Riot, Penguin, and other sites. Each book title was then typed into TikTok's search function, then ranked based on relevant hashtag views. Some books didn't make the cut because corresponding hashtags didn't come up in the search.</p><p>Based on the study, TikTok users can’t get enough books in genres like fantasy and romance, particularly for young adults (YA). With over 707 million hashtag views, Leigh Bardugo’s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Six-Crows-Collectors-Book-1/dp/1510106286/?tag=mf-tiktok-books-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Six of Crows</a>—</em>the first book in her YA fantasy <em>Six of Crows</em> duology from the Grishaverse—was the most popular book on the list. Fellow fantasy author <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sarah-J-Maas/e/B0070291GK?&linkCode=ll2&tag=mf-tiktok-books-20&linkId=fd837a62f5bcda4349daf95edd04765a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Sarah J. Maas</a> took the top spot as the most popular author on TikTok with over 572 million hashtag views. Two of her books—<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Throne-Glass-Sarah-J-Maas/dp/1619630346/?tag=mf-tiktok-books-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored"><em>Throne of Glass</em></a>, the first book in her series of the same name; and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Court-Mist-Fury-Thorns-Roses/dp/1635575583/?tag=mf-tiktok-books-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">A Court of Mist and Fury</a>,</em> the second book in her <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7JQTCR?binding=paperback&linkCode=ll2&tag=mf-tiktok-books-20&linkId=cb086de01729c5b1e1b2b027ed686c47&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored"><em>A Court of Thorns and Roses </em>series</a>—both made the list. In addition, romance books like Colleen Hoover’s 2016 contemporary novel <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ends-Us-Novel-Colleen-Hoover/dp/1501110365/?tag=mf-tiktok-books-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">It Ends With Us</a>,</em> about a complicated love triangle, appear in the top 10 ranking.</p><p>Check out which book titles and authors are the most popular on TikTok based on hashtag views below.</p><h2>Top 10 Most Popular Books on TikTok</h2><ol>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As many die-hard <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/581071/keanu-reeves-facts">Keanu Reeves</a> fans will tell you, the actor first caught the attention of audiences and studio executives with <em>River’s Edge</em>, a disturbing 1986 drama about a group of teens who face moral ruin after helping a friend cover up a murder.</p><p>But that wasn’t the only psychologically disturbing movie featuring a young Reeves that was released that year. The other was <em>Babes in Toyland</em>, a made-for-television holiday film that is best remembered as the film where the actor sings. Bear witness for yourself.</p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/62DGe9i9lGQ" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>
The Canadian-raised Reeves originally had set his sights on playing hockey before growing intrigued by performing. Prior to films like <em>River’s Edge</em> and the 1988 psychosexual drama <em>Dangerous Liaisons</em>, Reeves’s affable disposition was on full display. In 1984, he made an <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/630051/watch-keanu-reeves-interview-teddy-bears-1984" target="_blank">appearance</a> on CBC interviewing attendees of the Canadian International Teddy Bear Exposition. In the States, he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/19/arts/tv-weekend-drew-barrymore-stars-in-babes-in-toyland.html" target="_blank">featured</a> in made-for-television action films like <em>Under the Influence</em> and <em>Act of Vengeance</em>.</p><p>The small-screen projects continued with <em>Babes in Toyland</em>, which paired Reeves with Drew Barrymore (<em><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56256/20-things-you-might-not-know-about-et-extra-terrestrial">E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial</a></em>). The plot: Barrymore is swept away to a magical fantasy land to assist toy maker Pat Morita (<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/57156/30-facts-about-karate-kid"><em>The Karate Kid</em></a>) against evil toy store owner-turned-tyrant Barnaby Barnacle (Richard Mulligan).</p><p>The premise was loosely <a href="https://stageagent.com/shows/operetta/2427/babes-in-toyland" target="_blank">based</a> on a 1903 operetta of the same name that had been commissioned by stage producers Julian Mitchell and Fred Hamlin. The duo had pulled off a hit with a stage production of <em><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66583/13-facts-about-l-frank-baums-wonderful-wizard-oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a></em> in 1902. In an attempt to recapture that success, they hired <em>Oz</em> composer Victor Herbert to create the score. Their version of <em>Babes</em> had its characters (named Alan and Jane) navigate a fantasy land with the aid of popular (and public domain) storybook characters like Humpty Dumpty and Little Miss Muffet.</p><p>Following that production, <em>Babes</em> was revived periodically—both on stage and in features. A 1934 version was tailored to comedians Laurel and Hardy; a 1960 feature was produced by Disney. By the time NBC mounted a production in 1986, only two original songs from the first production remained and the story was now <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/461388561/?terms=%22Babes%20in%20Toyland%22&match=1" target="_blank">focused</a> on Lisa, an 11-year-old from Cincinnati who gets knocked on the head and wakes up in Toyland—a kind of budget Oz for Lisa, who was a Dorothy-like stand-in.</p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zzET-YwLKoE" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>
Barrymore was just 11 years old when she was <a href="https://people.com/movies/drew-barrymore-recalls-how-keanu-reeves-took-her-on-a-motorcycle-ride-on-her-16th-birthday/" target="_blank">cast</a> as Lisa; Reeves was 22. In the film, he <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/371673962/?terms=%22Babes%20in%20Toyland%22&match=1" target="_blank">plays</a> a friend of Barrymore’s whom she knows as Jack Be Nimble in the storybook world but who is actually a toy store clerk named Alex in the “real” world, and who is also dating her sister Margaret (Jill Shoelen).</p><p>The film, which <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/288646769/?terms=%22Babes%20in%20Toyland%22&match=1" target="_blank">aired</a> opposite an NFL football game and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74689/14-big-facts-about-dallas" target="_self"><em>Dallas</em></a> on December 19, 1986, was intended to be part of the network’s effort to offer family-friendly holiday fare and to <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/206019883/?terms=%22Babes%20in%20Toyland%22%20Keanu%20Reeves&match=1" target="_blank">compete</a> with CBS’s annual broadcast of 1939’s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/68137/17-wonderful-and-not-so-wonderful-facts-about-wizard-oz"><em>The Wizard of Oz</em></a>. At a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66669/10-unsinkable-facts-about-titanic" target="_self"><em>Titanic</em></a>-esque three hours (minus commercials), it was ambitious—but critics were mixed. The production values of the film, which was shot in Germany, were subpar—even for television of the era. <em>Evening Sun</em> critic Michael Hill declared it “outdated,” and insisted that Old Mother Hubbard was no match for a kid’s other juvenile fascinations like Transformers; Gannett critic Mike Hughes called it a “crummy piece of filmmaking.”</p><p>Reeves was not often cited in reviews. One of the few to single him out was <em>The New York Times</em>, which observed that he “looks understandably embarrassed each time he is required to join in another dreary song.”</p><iframe width="720" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72QjkINBvCQ" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p>
If NBC executives were expecting <em>Babes in Toyland</em> to become a perennial favorite, they were disappointed. The movie largely disappeared into obscurity, with the network unwilling to carve out three-hour blocks each holiday season for a film few admired. But it still stands as an interesting career point for Reeves, who would soon appear in 1989’s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/55079/15-things-you-might-not-know-about-bill-teds-excellent-adventure" target="_self"><em>Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure</em></a> as well as 1991’s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62432/16-totally-awesome-facts-about-point-break" target="_self"><em>Point Break</em></a>. It’s difficult to find any comment from Reeves about his network television past, which is probably a sign he doesn’t consider it much of a milestone.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to their ability to inflict pain that far outstrips their diminutive profile, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/53691/13-fascinating-facts-about-bees" target="_self">bees</a> are the bantamweights of nature. The sight or sound of them can prompt anxiety, flailing, and possibly anaphylactic shock if you’re allergic.</p><p>Something else to add to the laundry list of bee intimidation tactics: Some of them are carnivores.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/24/americas/meat-eating-bees-scn" target="_blank">CNN</a>, researchers have discovered gut bacteria in the so-called “vulture bees” found in Costa Rica that makes them able to process meat. It’s the same kind of bacteria found in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59210/vultures-find-food-little-help-their-friends" target="_self">vultures</a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/63455/12-wild-facts-about-hyenas" target="_self">hyenas</a>, and other animals that feed on carrion, or decaying flesh.</p><p>In some bee species, dead animal carcasses are on the menu. Other bees can also nosh on fresh corpses while still pining for pollen, nibbling with an extra tooth and <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/vulture-bees-have-specialized-microbiomes-that-aid-their-taste-in-meat-180979131/" target="_blank">bringing</a> meat back to the hive using leg baskets.</p><p>How the carnivorous bees evolved to swarming Sizzlers is a bit of a mystery. In a new study published in the journal <em><a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.02317-21" target="_blank">mBio</a></em>, 159 bees were given raw chicken as a treat and then had their DNA extracted from their guts. The vulture bees seemed to have developed an acidic gut, with meat-friendly bacteria like <em>Carnobacterium</em> replacing the more common bacteria found in most bee species. (Bees that do both meat and pollen have more diverse bacteria.)</p><p>While the bacterial composition of the vulture bees is a novel field of study, the bees themselves have been recognized for some time. Mention of them dates back to the 1700s; they were observed munching on flesh first-hand in 1982.</p><p>The big question, of course, is: How does devouring meat affect their production of honey? So far, it seems like it doesn’t. Honey derived from vulture bee hives apparently tastes no different.</p><p><em>[h/t <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/24/americas/meat-eating-bees-scn" target="_blank">CNN</a>]</em></p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Next to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/645871/why-dogs-go-wild-after-bath" target="_self">bath time</a> and nail clipping, administering medication may be the most dreaded chore for pets and their owners. Even the best-trained cat or dog is likely to squirm and claw their way out of your arms if you try feeding them a pill without a game plan. To make the process less painful for both of you, it helps to strategize.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/resources/how-to-give-your-dog-or-cat-a-pill/" target="_blank">ASPCA,</a> pairing the medicine with something more appealing works for both dogs and cats. For dogs, try wrapping the pill in a slice of lunch meat or cheese, or burying it beneath a spoonful of wet food or peanut butter. If they like the treat, they should inhale the whole package without noticing the hidden component.</p><p>Cats tend to be pickier than dogs, but you can still use food to trick them into taking their medicine in some cases. The easiest route is to mix the pill in with their regular meal and hope they eat it at dinner time. If that doesn't work, try inserting the tablet into a soft treat. Some treats, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Feline-Greenies-Pockets-Treats-Chicken/dp/B001FSJCPK?th=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mf-how-to-feed-pills-pets-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">Pill Pockets</a>, come with a cavity in the middle designed especially for this purpose.</p><p>These tricks won't work on every pet, however. Feeding medicine to especially stubborn animals may require a more direct method. Whether you're <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/giving-pills-to-dogs" target="_blank">handling a cat or dog</a>, use your non-dominant hand to lift their upper jaw until their mouth falls open. With your other hand, place the pill as far back in their mouth as possible without stimulating their gag reflex. Close their mouth and gently massage their throat to encourage them to swallow. A dog or cat will usually lick their nose or lips after swallowing something. Even when you think the pill is gone, keep an eye on your pet for a few minutes to make sure it really went down.</p><p>Rewarding your pet with treats and praise during this process can help them associate it with pleasant feelings the next time they have to take their medication. For cats, you may want to swaddle them in a blanket before holding their mouth open to prevent them from scratching you or slipping away. If the cat you're caring for won't let you come anywhere close, try these tips for <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/549585/science-backed-tips-for-getting-a-cat-to-like-you" target="_self">getting a cat to like you</a> and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/643196/how-to-defend-yourself-against-cat" target="_self">defending yourself against a cat</a>.</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Winter is the perfect time to cuddle up with a good book or gather around a fire with loved ones, and adding a festive drink can bring your holiday festivities to the next level. From an indulgent <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72668/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-eggnog" target="_self">eggnog</a> to a rich hot chocolate, these classic holiday drinks will keep you feeling cozy throughout the season.</p><h2>1. Eggnog</h2><p>Eggnog is a classic holiday drink—the creamy, spiced concoction is a staple at many holiday parties. This <a href="https://www.liquor.com/recipes/eggnog/" target="_blank">eggnog recipe</a> uses eggs, sugar, whole milk, and bourbon to create a comforting and satisfying beverage. The entire mixing process takes just a few minutes, so you'll be able easily whip some up and impress your party guests. For an even boozier option, you can try to recreate <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/26537/way-more-you-ever-wanted-know-about-eggnog" target="_self">George Washington’s famous eggnog</a> recipe.</p><h2>2. Pink Peppermint Cocktail</h2><p>Peppermint has long been associated with Christmas. <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/christmas-traditions-why-do-we-eat-candy-canes-1.2870554" target="_blank">According to the CBC</a>, candy canes first appeared in the late 1600s, when a choirmaster <strong>w</strong>ho had been using candy to keep children quiet during a Christmas service went to a candymaker and asked him to make a candy cane that he could use as a teaching tool. </p><p>Today, more than 1 billion <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/26723/10-sweet-facts-about-candy-canes" target="_self">candy canes</a> are sold each year around the holidays. For an adult spin on the classic seasonal treat, use it as part of a cocktail. The <a href="https://www.howsweeteats.com/2018/12/pink-peppermint-cocktail/" target="_blank">How Sweet Eats Pink Peppermint Cocktail</a> is festive, delicious, and easy to make. The blend of minty and sweet flavors is refreshing and comforting at the same time.</p><h2>3. Homemade Chai</h2><p>Chai, which means “tea” in Hindi, is a delicious blend of spices that originates from India. The warming concoction is perfect for sipping on Christmas morning or any other chilly winter day. Traditional chai ingredients include anise, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and black tea. By combining a mix of warming spices with a cup of milk, you can build a spicy yet comforting non-alcoholic beverage for the holiday season. According <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/chai/" target="_blank">to this recipe</a>, the whole process should take 30 minutes or less.</p><h2>4. Creamy Hot Cocoa</h2><p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72909/13-things-you-might-not-know-about-hot-chocolate" target="_self">Hot chocolate</a> has been around for thousands of years. This sweet treat is believed to have <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/the-history-of-hot-chocolate-764463" target="_blank">originated in Mexico</a>, where the Mayans drank a spicier version of it as early as 500 BCE. Today, people around the world sip a heavier, sweeter version of hot chocolate once a winter chill hits. This recipe for <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/20211/creamy-hot-cocoa/" target="_blank">creamy hot cocoa</a> requires unsweetened cocoa, sugar, milk, half-and-half, and vanilla. For a boozier option, add a bit of <a href="https://mixthatdrink.com/kahlua-hot-chocolate/" target="_blank">kahlua</a>.</p><h2>5. Purple Punch</h2><p><a href="https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a51344/purple-punch-recipe/" target="_blank">Purple Punch</a> blends Red Bull with lemonade, blueberries, and mint to make a refreshing, fruity drink. It's light but sweet; perfect for those who need a break from other heavier, creamier holiday drinks. In the same way that you would muddle mint for a mojito, you’ll muddle mint, blueberries, and lemon to create the base for this delicious <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/652196/best-mocktail-recipes-holiday-season" target="_self">mocktail</a>. If you’d like to turn this classic drink into an alcoholic cocktail, you can add an ounce of the vodka of your choice.</p>
