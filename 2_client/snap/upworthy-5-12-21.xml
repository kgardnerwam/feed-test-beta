        <p>Dad&#x2019;s ultra cool club attire consists of square rim glasses, a button-up top, and, of course, a gilet (because as we all know, the club is a notoriously chilly place).</p><p>The ensemble was, undoubtedly, a hit.</p><p>&#x201C;You let him go with a vest on? Let some of the other guys have a chance,&#x201D; one person wrote.</p><p>After doing the &#x201C;classic dad overview of the scene&#x201D; and snapping a quick selfie for the family group chat, he&#x2019;s ready to party. And by party, I mean he&#x2019;s ready to sip Diet Coke while the rest of the group downs tequila shots. </p><p>Flo Rida&#x2019;s club classic &#x201C;Apple Bottom Jeans&#x201D; plays in the background, to which dad knows every lyric. He&#x2019;s even seen fist pumping while checking work emails. That&#x2019;s about as &#x201C;dad lit&#x201D; as it gets. </p>

        <p>The last thing we see is him dancing out of the exit, which Talia explains is to &#x201C;remind everyone that he&#x2019;s the main character.&#x201D; TikTok seems to agree. One user joked: &#x201C;He is the main character and we are just living in his world.&#x201D;</p><p>Finding the video oddly &#x2026; relatable? Don&#x2019;t worry, you&#x2019;re not alone. Many people in the comments had the same epiphany.</p><p><em>&#x201C;The work emails LMAO that&#x2019;s me writing discussion posts at like 11:40 while I&#x2019;m out partying.&#x201D;</em></p><p><em>&#x201C;But that&#x2019;s literally me at the club... am I? Am I? A dad??&#x201D;</em></p><p>Talia wrote in the comments that her dad was so excited his video outperformed her mom&#x2019;s (yes, she was at the club too), because apparently whenever Talia posts family videos, mom wins.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body-description"><div class="redactor-editor" dir="ltr" placeholder="Start writing..."><p>The world must have been&#x2014;mostly&#x2014;good this year. Because Elton John and Ed Sheeran have teamed up to gift us all with a brand new Christmas single. </p>
<p>The song, aptly named &#x201C;Merry Christmas,&#x201D; is a perfect blend of silly and sweet that&#x2019;s cheery, bright and just a touch bizarre. </p>
<p>Created with the holiday spirit in every way, it has whimsical snowball fights, snow angels (basically all the snow things), festive sweaters, iconic throwbacks and twinkling lights galore. Plus all profits from the tune are dedicated to two charities: the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. </p>I personally don&#x2019;t know which is more of a highlight: Ed Sheeran channeling his inner-Mariah, performing a faux sexy dance in a leg revealing Santa outfit, or him flying through the air with a giant Frosty the Snowman &#x2026; who seems to be sporting glasses similar to Elton&#x2019;s. Are we meant to believe that Elton <em>is</em> the Snowman? This music video even has mystery.</div><hr><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div>

        <p>Sheeran and John&#x2019;s holiday duet has already racked up more than 2 million views, and going by the comments, it&#x2019;s making people&#x2019;s hearts grow three times in size. </p><p><em>&#x201C;Okay now this is a perfect cheesy Christmas song, and I&#x2019;m totally in love with it.&#x201D; </em></p><p><em>&#x201C;The best Christmas song to be released in years! I love it and it&#x2019;s now going to be the theme tune to Christmas 2021 in our house!&#x201D;</em></p><p><em>&#x201C;Love it. Already learned it on piano. Catchy tune. Bit of Christmas spirit and for good causes.&#x201D;</em> </p><p>One person even gave us a little music history lesson, saying that &#x201C;many don&apos;t realize Elton John helped get Ed Sheeran first signed.&#x201D; That certainly explains the chemistry. </p><p>If you&#x2019;re looking for a way to un-Scrooge, or simply wanting a laugh, this music video might be just the thing you need today.</p>

When I went to talk to the driver, I found a young black male, who was looking at me like he was absolutely terrified with his hands up. He said, &apos;What do you want me to do officer?&apos; His voice was quivering. He was genuinely scared,&quot; McMillan wrote.</p><h2>But McMillan said he wasn&apos;t interested in harassing or arresting the young man, let alone inflicting violence upon him. Nonetheless, the teen&apos;s emotional response hit McMillan like a punch to the gut.</h2><p>&#x201C;I just looked at him for a moment, because what I was seeing made me sad. I said, &apos;I just don&apos;t want you to get hurt.&apos; In which he replied, with his voice still shaking, &apos;Do you want me to get out of the car.&apos; I said, &apos;No, I don&apos;t want you to text and drive. I don&apos;t want you to get in a wreck. I want your mom to always have her baby boy. I want you to grow up and be somebody. I don&apos;t even want to write you a ticket. Just please pay attention, and put the phone down.

        <p>Throughout the six episodes, Morgan took a look back at the history and the legacy of the Paralympic movement and the impact it&apos;s had on host cities and beyond. She also spoke with actress Jameela Jamil (&quot;The Good Place&quot;) who has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a group of disorders that affect connective tissue, about ableism in Hollywood.</p><p>&quot;For someone who maybe has just found that they have a disability, that someone they love does, or they want to be an ally for people with disabilities, this is a perfect series for you,&quot; <a href="https://parade.com/1263725/leighweingus/jameela-jamil-invisible-disabilties/" target="_blank">Jamil says</a>. &quot;It&apos;s full of very real conversations, but they&apos;re incredibly entertaining, too.&quot;<br></p><p>Morgan also had a conversation with Keely Cat Wells who runs a talent agency for disabled talent and Yoshihiko Kawauchi, an architect and wheelchair user who advised Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 on venue construction.<br></p><p>After six episodes, the show&apos;s co-producer, Sinead Burke, is proud that she and Morgan were able to achieve the show&apos;s ultimate goal of inclusivity.<br></p>

        <p>&quot;I think it&apos;s been so brilliant to have six different threads of conversations under the umbrella of disability,&quot; she said on episode 6, &quot;The Decade Ahead.&quot; &quot;When we began this podcast we had lots of conversations back and forth about who the audience was. Was it non-disabled people? Was it disabled people? Or was it allies? Was it athletes? One of the things we&apos;ve been really considerate around is making sure that across these six episodes that we appeal to listen to amplify and bring questions to each of those audiences.&quot;</p><p>Morgan boiled the far-reaching effort down to one big takeaway. People with disabilities need greater representation in the places where decisions are being made.</p><p>&quot;I feel that the next part of this journey to take that giant leap forward, not slowly incremental changes, we need to see disabled people in decision-making roles,&quot; she said in episode 6.</p><p>&quot;We need to see disabled people across the board because then we don&apos;t need to present our argument for why you need to be represented or why you should be in the room,&quot; she added. &quot;Somebody will get it already. The paradigm shift will happen organically.&quot;</p><p>To be a part of the new push towards equality for the 15% of humanity living with a disability, <a href="https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1119-seneca-women-conversation-58553394/" target="_blank">listen to &apos;Equal Too: Achieving Disability Equality&apos; now on iHeart Radio</a> or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

A sign was placed to ensure future researchers could locate and study it. </p><h2>16 years later, Janzen dispatched graduate student Timothy Treuer to look for the site where the food waste was dumped. </h2><p>Treuer initially set out to locate the large placard that marked the plot &#x2014; and failed.</p><p>&quot;It&apos;s a huge sign, bright yellow lettering. We should have been able to see it,&quot; Treuer says. After wandering around for half an hour with no luck, he consulted Janzen, who gave him more detailed instructions on how to find the plot.</p><p>When he returned a week later and confirmed he was in the right place, Treuer was floored.

      <category>Heroes</category>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="body-description"><div class="redactor-editor" dir="ltr" placeholder="Start writing..."><p>Frida Kahlo is, undoubtedly, an iconic artist. Her paintings continue to engage even a contemporary audience. And her life story inspires us to transmute our pain into beauty. </p>
<p>Among her many famous quotes, you might have ran across this one: </p>
<p>&#x201C;I used to think I was the strangest person in the world, but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do.&#x201D;</p>
<p>That quote, though mainstream, was not created by Kahlo at all. It was actually made by a 17-year-old girl in 2008. </p>
<p>The early 2000s were a time where teenagers transitioned from the private journal entry to the more public&#x2014;while still anonymous&#x2014;forums of online blogs. Rebecca Martin found her creative outlet on a site called <a href="https://postsecret.com/" target="_blank">PostSecret</a>. Using a magazine cut-out image of Kahlo, she combined it with her typed-out words as a mini collage and posted it to the site.</p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/adeonibada/frida-kahlo-quote-investigator-moma" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BuzzFeed</a>, Martin shared how excited she was to see that her work made it to the very top of the blog. Little did she know that it would begin a long-enduring mix-up of creative attribution.</div><hr><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div>
<div class="rebellt-item    col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/frida-kahlo-quote-belongs-to-teenage-girl?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655906622" data-published-at="1638404677" data-use-pagination="False">
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This Quote Has Been Attributed To Frida Kahlo For Years, But It&apos;s Actually From A Canadian Teenager <a href="https://t.co/LHD94Mr4Lr">https://t.co/LHD94Mr4Lr</a></p>&#x2014; ade onibada (@SincerelyAde) <a href="https://twitter.com/SincerelyAde/status/1465995853416615943?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>The quote spread like artistic wildfire. In 2015, Martin discovered a <a href="http://www.zenpencils.com/comic/frida/" target="_blank">comic strip</a> featuring a young girl, with a similar appearance to Kahlo. In the comic, the young girl struggles to find a sense of belonging until she stumbles across the works of Frida Kahlo. Martin&#x2019;s quote not only makes it into the comic, it&#x2019;s the written through line of the piece. And it&#x2019;s credited to Kahlo.<br></p><p>Martin then had to contact <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/" target="_blank">Quote Investigator</a>, the comic creator and the Frida Kahlo estate to receive proper attribution. But that wouldn&#x2019;t be the end of it.<br></p>

        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;I used to think I was the strangest person in the world but then I thought there are so many people in the world, there must be someone just like me who feels bizarre and flawed in the same ways I do.&quot; &#x2014; Frida Kahlo<br><br>&#x2014;<br>Frida Kahlo. &#x201C;Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair.&#x201D; 1940. <a href="https://t.co/lWIvk73s7y">pic.twitter.com/lWIvk73s7y</a></p>&#x2014; MoMA The Museum of Modern Art (@MuseumModernArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/MuseumModernArt/status/1462803457434439680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>Recently, on November 22, the Museum of Modern Art used the quote while promoting its exhibit featuring three of Kahlo&apos;s most famous self-portraits. The museum quickly corrected itself in a follow-up post. But still, the erroneous tweet remains. </p><p>Reading the quote, you can see how even a high-profile institution like MoMA would mistakenly hear Kahlo&apos;s voice. Both women share the same soft, poetic nature. But this sparks another question. Would people find the message as impactful knowing it came from a teenage girl online, rather than then famous Frida Kahlo? </p><p>Martin seems to think otherwise. She told BuzzFeed &#x201C;I think people really like to believe that Frida Kahlo said it because she&apos;s such a powerful figure and the quote is really very vulnerable and soft, and it&apos;s asking for connection and I think people like to feel connected to Frida Kahlo in that way. I think it&apos;s less exciting to feel connected to me.&#x201D; </p><p>Which is a bit sad, really. Clearly Martin&#x2019;s quote moved people. And creativity doesn&#x2019;t become more or less moving when it comes from someone famous. This alludes to an odd form of celebrity worship we have as a society, which keeps us from being affected by one another in a genuine way.</p>

        <p>Just as Kahlo&apos;s works are no longer simply hers, so too have Martin&apos;s words morphed into something all their own. Such is the nature of art once we share it with the world. Better yet, Martin&apos;s unique experience made way for her own special connection with one of the world&#x2019;s greatest artists, someone &#x201C;bizarre and flawed&#x201D; just like her.</p><p>By the way, if you&#x2019;re curious about what <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/52760.Frida_Kahlo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual Frida Kahlo quotes</a> look like, here are a few: </p><p>&#x201C;At the end of the day, we can endure much more than we think we can.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Pain, pleasure and death are no more than a process for existence. The revolutionary struggle in this process is a doorway open to intelligence&quot;</p><p>&#x201C;Nothing is worth more than laughter. It is strength to laugh and to abandon oneself, to be light. Tragedy is the most ridiculous thing.&#x201D;</p>

That&#x2019;s quite the honor, too. He&#x2019;s even ranked higher than William Shatner from &#x201C;Star Trek&#x201D; and actor Seth Rogen. That&#x2019;s truly rarified Canadian air.</p><p>Drake is also a huge NBA fan and is a regular sight at Toronto Raptors games.</p><p>On Wednesday, he was in Oklahoma for the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Houston Rockets game, sitting courtside to support fellow Torontonian, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Thunder.</p><p>Before the Rockets were ready to hit the court, a camera crew posted up in front of Drake and he responded with a nonchalant peace sign.

        <p>The video is a wonderful reminder that even some of the most famous people in the world aren&#x2019;t known by everyone. Even a person like Drake has to explain who he is to from time to time. It&#x2019;s fun to see that Drake got a kick out of people being genuinely curious about who he is and what all the fuss is about.</p><p>Plus, it must be nice for him just to be treated like a normal person from time to time instead of always being the center of attention.</p><p>Drake has always been known as the &#x201C;nice guy&#x201D; of rap and this video proves that the image may actually be true.</p><p>Drake has <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/drake-philanthropy-timeline-8098822/" target="_blank">a long history</a> of charitable giving. He gave $200,000 to J.J. Watt&#x2019;s charity to help those affected by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. He&#x2019;s also donated money to schools, homeless shelters and an Ohio woman who lost her five kids and boyfriend in a fire in 2013.</p><p>Here&#x2019;s a cute video of Drake waving hello to a man&#x2019;s daughter at the game on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Sandra Bullock recently appeared on an episode of Jada Pinkett Smith&#x2019;s &quot;Red Table Talk,&quot; where she discussed the realities of being a white mom to two black children.</p>
<p>Bullock adopted her son Louis and her daughter Laila between 2010 and 2015, and since the adoption has been praised not only for being so open with her children about race, but for approaching it through their perspective, versus one of privilege. </p>
<p> &#x201C;To say that I wished our skins matched&#x2026;sometimes I do. Because then it would be easier on how people approached us,&#x201D; she admitted. </p>
<p>It might make things easier, but for Bullock and her children, that is simply not the truth. </p>No parent wants to tell their child that the world can often be a scary and unfair place, but not having the difficult conversation is, as Bullock told <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2015/10/20/sandra-bullock-my-son-absolutely-aware-racism/74261918/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">BET</a> in 2015, a &#x201C;disservice.&#x201D;</div><hr><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div>

        <p>She added:</p>
<p>&#x201C;I can&apos;t ride in a bubble with him. I want him to know the truth&#x2026;that you&#x2019;ll be judged by the color of your skin rather than the content of your character. But it exists, and I want him to be safe and I want him to be aware. Once he leaves that house and I&#x2019;m not with him, it&#x2019;s his life and how he approaches it is his decision&#x2026;I want to know that I did the best I could as his mom to educate him on the ugliness in the world, and also the beauty.&#x201D;</p>

        <p>In an interview with <a href="https://thegrio.com/2021/12/01/sandra-bullock-black-children/" target="_blank">theGrio</a>, Bullock reflected on a heartbreaking experience after seeing son Louis wearing a hoodie. It&#x2019;s crazy to think that something as innocent as this could be life-threatening, but as the countless stories of racial profiling continue to make headlines, it is a consistently relevant and crucial conversation to have.</p><p>She asked her 6-year-old, &#x201C;What does it look like you&#x2019;re doing with the hoodie?&#x201D;</p><p>Louis&#x2019; response: &#x201C;Well, I look like I&#x2019;m hiding.&#x201D;</p><p>Bullock told theGrio that Louis is well aware that he would be treated differently as a white boy. She reiterated that she &#x201C;doesn&#x2019;t care&#x201D; if that fact scares her children, because it is her &#x201C;job to let them know that outside of these safe walls, that things are different.&#x201D;</p><p>The responsibility of a parent is to make the children aware of potential dangers they are likely to face, to fully equip and prepare them. For parents with children of color, this includes the added weight of discussing the prejudice waiting for them outside the safety of home. </p>

While the Brooklyn organization is open to any Black person, Kiara and Tann specifically want to encourage dark-skinned artists to train in an affirming space among people with similar identities.</p><p>To make room for newcomers, the club recently moved into a larger studio with a third station for apprentices or guest artists. Unlike a traditional fundraiser that supports the organization exclusively, Black Fluidity Tattoo Club will distribute proceeds from GoFundMe directly to emerging Black tattoo artists who are starting their own businesses. The small grants, supported in part with a $500 contribution from the Upworthy Kindness Fund, will go towards artists&#x2019; equipment, supplies, furnishings, and other start-up costs.</p><div id="577f5" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="77734ffb6de0f532c8c65a15cbc801c1">

I was honest when I met him that I was looking for something more than just sex, and he led me to believe that was what he wanted, too. </p><p>Between mind-blowing sex sessions, we ordered in, played video games, and watched movies &#x2014; couple things but without the label. But when I tried to get him to go to a show or out to dinner with me, he refused. My frustration grew as the months went on, and one day I confronted him.</p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div><p></p><hr><p>&quot;Why don&apos;t we ever go anywhere?&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have everything we need here,&quot; he answered while simultaneously distracting me by caressing my shoulder blades.</p><p>&quot;We actually don&apos;t,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;m hungry, let&apos;s check out that new Indian place around the corner.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No! We might run into one of my buddies,&quot; he said, moving his body further away from me. The underlining meaning was clear &#x2014; he couldn&apos;t take the chance that someone he knew would see him with me.</p><h2>He needed to keep our relationship on the DL so that no one would ever suspect that he enjoyed spending time with me &#x2014; a <a href="https://ravishly.com/im-fat-im-fabulous-im-not-your-fetish" target="_blank">fat woman</a>.</h2><p>He was super fit, so obviously that&apos;s the kind of woman he wanted to be associated with, the kind he could be seen with at the Indian place.</p><p>When I realized he was ashamed of being seen with me, I felt as if I had been punched in the stomach &#x2014; a place where much of my pain already resided.</p><p>To him, I was fuckable but not dateable. He dumped me soon after that conversation. </p><p>He did me a favor by not continuing to lead me on. Otherwise, I might still be trying to prove to him that I was worth any shit he might have gotten from other people. If I was still his secret shame, I might not have met my next boyfriend, so thanks, athletic asshole.</p><p>I had hoped that, in this age of body positivity, men would no longer need to hide their desires when it comes to fat women.</p><p>But I was wrong.</p><h2>It&apos;s just a sad fact: Many men who are sexually attracted to fat women are ashamed of it.  </h2><p>They&apos;re OK with banging a fat girl, but they don&apos;t want to hang out with her &#x2014; someone might judge them for it. </p><p>It&apos;s one thing if you&apos;re not into fat women &#x2014; everyone has their preferences, and not every body type appeals to everyone. But if you find larger women hot and you want to have sex with them without being associated in public with them, that&apos;s emotionally abusive.</p><p>Everyone should have the freedom to express their desires openly (as long as there&apos;s consent from both parties). If you modify your behavior and wants to what you think will protect you from criticism and/or ridicule, then you need help because that kind of self-loathing will only grow until it has destroyed you.</p><h2>Don&apos;t act like we&apos;re in a relationship if all you really want is to experience what sex with a fat woman is like.</h2><p>I&apos;ll tell you what it&apos;s like: It&apos;s as amazing and fun as having sex with anyone who&apos;s into having sex with you. We don&apos;t have magic vaginas, and our breasts don&apos;t do any special tricks &#x2014; well besides the usual, like feed or comfort people. </p><p>Fat women are just as hot and sexually gifted as women of other shapes, sizes, and abilities. Being fat doesn&apos;t mean we&apos;re so hungry for attention that we&apos;ll put our own needs aside and do whatever we can to rock your world.</p><h2>If you&apos;re with someone who doesn&apos;t make you feel beautiful or who isn&apos;t proud to have you on their arm, you need to dump their ass. </h2><p>Being alone is far better than compromising on what you deserve or being made to feel as if you&apos;re someone&apos;s big dirty secret.</p><p>You&apos;re not only <a href="https://everydayfeminism.com/2013/01/how-to-date-a-fat-girl-2/" target="_blank">dateable</a>, you&apos;re lovable and worthy of being treated with respect and love. </p><p>I regret not standing up for myself when I discovered the athletic guy was only using me for sex. But at least I learned, as we all should learn, that I&apos;m responsible for being my biggest advocate and to never accepting anything less than what I need.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

On one hand, you have people who feel that abortion is a fundamental women&apos;s rights issue, that our bodily autonomy is not something you can legislate, and that those who oppose abortion rights are trying to control women through oppressive legislation. On the other, you have folks who believe that a fetus is a human individual first and foremost, that no one has the right to terminate a human life, and that those who support abortion rights are heartless murderers.</p><p><strong>Then there are those of us in the messy middle.</strong> Those who believe that life begins at conception, that abortion isn&apos;t something we&apos;d choose&#x2014;and we&apos;d hope others wouldn&apos;t choose&#x2014;under most circumstances, yet who choose to vote to keep abortion legal.</p><hr><p>It is entirely possible to be morally anti-abortion and politically pro-choice without feeling conflicted about it.

        <h3 data-role="headline">

                There&apos;s far too much gray area to legislate.


        </h3>
        <h2><br></h2><p>No matter what you believe, when exactly life begins and when &#x201C;a clump of cells&quot; should be considered an individual, autonomous human being is a debatable question.</p><p>I <em>personally</em> believe life begins at conception, but that&apos;s my religious belief about when the soul becomes associated with the body, not a scientific fact. As Arthur Caplan, award-winning professor of bioethics at New York University, <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2017/04/when-does-life-begin-outside-the-christian-right-the-answer-is-over-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told Slate</a>, &#x201C;Many scientists would say they don&apos;t know when life begins. There are a series of landmark moments. The first is conception, the second is the development of the spine, the third the development of the brain, consciousness, and so on.&quot;</p><p>But let&apos;s say, for the sake of argument, that a human life unquestionably begins at conception. Even with that point of view, there are too many issues that make a black-and-white approach to abortion too problematic to ban it.</p>
</div>
<div class="rebellt-item    col1" id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/it-is-possible-to-be-morally-pro-life-and-politically-pro-choice-at-the-same-time?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" data-basename="abortion-bans-hurt-some-mothers-who-desperately-want-their-babies-to-live-and-i-m-not-okay-with-that" data-post-id="2637239710" data-published-at="1638464520" data-use-pagination="False">
        <h3 data-role="headline">

                Abortion bans hurt some mothers who desperately want their babies to live, and I&apos;m not okay with that.


        </h3>
        <p>One reason I don&apos;t support banning abortion is because I&apos;ve seen too many families deeply harmed by restrictive abortion laws.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard too many stories of families who <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/loss-abortion-worst-thing-been-through-should-be-legal/" target="_blank">desperately wanted a baby</a>, who ended up having to make the rock-and-a-hard-place choice to abort because the alternative would have been <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/abortion-a-choice-i-never-knew-id-have-to-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a short, pain-filled life </a>for their child.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard too many stories of mothers having to endure <a href="https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/nekpw7/i-went-to-a-catholic-hospital-during-my-miscarriageand-it-nearly-killed-me" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">long, drawn out, potentially dangerous miscarriages </a>and <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/texas-forced-this-woman-to-deliver-a-stillborn-baby" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being forced to carry a dead baby</a> inside of them because abortion restrictions gave them no other choice.</p><p>I&apos;ve heard too many stories of abortion laws doing real harm to mothers and babies, and too many stories of families who were staunchly anti-abortion until they found themselves <a href="https://www.scarymommy.com/crisis-pregnancies-stillbirth-changed-views-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in circumstances they never could have imagined</a>, to believe that abortion is always wrong and should be banned at any particular stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="rebellt-item    col1" id="rebelltitem3" data-id="3" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/it-is-possible-to-be-morally-pro-life-and-politically-pro-choice-at-the-same-time?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" data-basename="i-am-not-willing-to-serve-as-judge-and-jury-on-a-woman-s-medical-decisions-and-i-don-t-think-the-government-should-either" data-post-id="2637239710" data-published-at="1638464520" data-use-pagination="False">
        <h3 data-role="headline">

                I am not willing to serve as judge and jury on a woman&apos;s medical decisions, and I don&apos;t think the government should&#xA0;either.


        </h3>
        <p>Most people&apos;s anti-abortion views&#x2014;mine included&#x2014;are based on their religious beliefs, and I don&apos;t believe that anyone&apos;s religion should be the basis for the laws in our country. (For the record, any Christian who wants biblical teachings to influence U.S. law, yet cries &#x201C;Shariah is coming!&quot; when they see a Muslim legislator, is a hypocrite.)</p><p>I also don&apos;t want politicians sticking their noses into my very personal medical choices. There are just too many circumstances (<em>seriously, please read the stories linked in the previous section</em>) that make abortion a choice I hope I&apos;d never have to make, but wouldn&apos;t want banned. I don&apos;t understand why the same people who decry government overreach think the government should be involved in these extremely personal medical decisions.</p><p>And yes, ultimately, abortion is a personal medical decision. Even if I believe that a fetus is a human being at every stage, that human being&apos;s creation is inextricably linked to and dependent upon its mother&apos;s body. And while I don&apos;t think that means women should abort inconvenient pregnancies, I also acknowledge that trying to force a woman to grow and deliver a baby that she may not have chosen to conceive isn&apos;t something the government should be in the business of doing.</p><p>As a person of faith, my role is not to judge or vilify, but to love and support women who are facing difficult choices.

                Most importantly, if the goal is to prevent abortion, research shows that outlawing it isn&apos;t the way to go.

        <p>The biggest reason I vote the way I do is because based on my research pro-choice platforms provide the best chance of reducing abortion rates.</p><p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/ss/ss6713a1.htm?s_cid=ss6713a1_w" target="_blank">Abortion rates fell by 24%</a> in the past decade and are at their <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/01/17/509734620/u-s-abortion-rate-falls-to-lowest-level-since-roe-v-wade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest levels in 40 years</a> in America. Abortion has been legal during that time, so clearly, keeping abortion legal and available has not resulted in increased abortion rates. Switzerland has the <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/fertility-matters_the-secret-of-switzerland-s-low-abortion-rate/33585760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest abortion rate on earth</a> and their rate has been falling since 2002, when abortion became largely unrestricted.</p><p>Outlawing abortion doesn&apos;t stop it, it just <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-03-31/heres-what-happens-country-where-women-are-punished-having-abortions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pushes it underground </a>and makes it more dangerous. And if a woman dies in a botched abortion, so does her baby. Banning abortion is a recipe for more lives being lost, not fewer.</p><p>At this point, <a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2016/05/abortion-rates-are-constant-in-developing-countries-while-developed-ones-see-a-sharp-drop.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the only things consistently proven to reduce abortion rates </a>are comprehensive sex education and easy, affordable access to birth control. If we want to reduce abortions, that&apos;s where we should be putting our energy. The problem is, anti-abortion activists also tend to be the same people pushing for abstinence-only education and making birth control harder to obtain. But those goals can&apos;t co-exist in the real world.</p><p>Our laws should be based on reality and on the best data we have available. Since comprehensive sex education and easy, affordable access to birth control&#x2014;the most proven methods of reducing abortion rates&#x2014;are the domain of the pro-choice crowd, that&apos;s where I place my vote, and why I do so with a clear conscience.</p>

They may have worked very hard for what they have accomplished and they may have overcome many obstacles to accomplish it. And the word &quot;privilege&quot; can make a person feel as though that work is being diminished.</p><p>The key point about privilege, though, is that it doesn&apos;t mean that a person was raised by wealthy parents, had everything handed to them, and didn&apos;t have to do much other than show up.<strong> </strong></p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div><p></p><hr><p><strong>Privilege means that some of us have advantages over others for any number of reasons we don&apos;t control &#x2014; like who we are, where we come from, the color of our skin, or certain things that have happened in our lives.</strong></p><p><strong></strong>Even when things haven&apos;t come <em>easy</em> for some people, they can still have privileges that others don&apos;t have.</p><h2>Illustrator Toby Morris did some thinking about the concept of inequality and privilege, and he found one major problem.</h2><p>He did a lot of research to learn about it,  but as he started to really understand privilege, he found that a lot of the information about privilege felt very academic and technical. He felt it was important to &quot;talk about this heavy stuff in a really simple and clear way,&quot; Morris explained to me in an email interview. </p><h2>That&apos;s what led him to create and illustrate this incredible comic on privilege for the <a href="http://thewireless.co.nz/articles/the-pencilsword-on-a-plate" target="_blank">The Wireless</a>. </h2><p>He did an amazing job.

	Fifty years ago, when Paul McCartney announced he had left the Beatles, the news dashed the hopes of millions of fans, while fueling false reunion rumors that persisted well into the new decade.
</p><p>
	In a press release on April 10, 1970 for his first solo album, &quot;McCartney,&quot; he leaked his intention to leave. In doing so, he shocked his three bandmates.
</p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div><p></p><p>
	The Beatles had symbolized the great communal spirit of the era. How could they possibly come apart?</p><hr><p>
	Few at the time were aware of the underlying fissures. The power struggles in the group had been mounting at least since their manager, Brian Epstein, died in August of 1967.
</p><h2>&apos;Paul Quits the Beatles&apos;</h2><p>
	Was McCartney&apos;s &quot;announcement&quot; official? His album appeared on April 17, and its press packet included a mock interview. In it, McCartney is asked, &quot;Are you planning a new album or single with the Beatles?&quot;
</p><p>
	His response? &quot;No.&quot;
</p><figure><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yMjkyODU5MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4NzM3NzU2MH0.RDPmWPtVHoE8rFu3YvE191Gnb9tQhzdD2GkJ_fRLKrM/img.jpg?width=980"><figcaption>via The Daily Mirror</figcaption></figure><p>
	But he didn&apos;t say whether the separation might prove permanent. The Daily Mirror nonetheless framed its headline conclusively: &quot;Paul Quits the Beatles.&quot;<br>
</p><p>
	The others worried this could hurt sales and sent Ringo as a peacemaker to McCartney&apos;s London home to talk him down from releasing his solo album ahead of the band&apos;s &quot;Let It Be&quot; album and film, which were slated to come out in May. Without any press present, McCartney shouted Ringo<a href="https://www.beatlesbible.com/1970/03/31/paul-mccartney-ringo-starr-letter-john-lennon-george-harrison-let-it-be/" target="_blank"> off his front stoop.</a>
</p><h2>Lennon had kept quiet</h2><p>
	Lennon, who had been active outside the band for months, felt particularly betrayed.
</p><p>
	The previous September, soon after the band released &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; he had asked his bandmates for a &quot;divorce.&quot; But the others convinced him not to go public to prevent disrupting some delicate contract negotiations.
</p><p>
	Still, Lennon&apos;s departure seemed imminent: He had played the Toronto Rock &apos;n&apos; Roll Festival with his Plastic Ono Band in September 1969, and on Feb. 11, 1970, he performed a new solo track, &quot;Instant Karma,&quot; on the popular British TV show &quot;Top of the Pops.&quot; Yoko Ono sat behind him, knitting while blindfolded by a sanitary napkin.
</p><p>
	In fact, Lennon behaved more and more like a solo artist, until McCartney countered with his own eponymous album. He wanted Apple to release this solo debut alongside the group&apos;s new album, &quot;Let It Be,&quot; to dramatize the split.
</p><div class="rm-embed embed-media"><p>
		<a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/the-beatles-john-lennon-FeGlju8nZTT7W"></a>
	</p></div><p>
	By beating Lennon to the announcement, McCartney controlled the story and its timing, and undercut the other three&apos;s interest in keeping it under wraps as new product hit stores.
</p><p>
	Ray Connolly, a reporter at the Daily Mail, knew Lennon well enough to ring him up for comment. When I interviewed Connolly in 2008, he told me about their conversation.
</p><p>
	Lennon was dumbfounded and enraged by the news. He had let Connolly in on his secret about leaving the band at his Montreal Bed-In in December 1969, but asked him to keep it quiet. Now he lambasted Connolly for not leaking it sooner.
</p><p>
	&quot;Why didn&apos;t you write it when I told you in Canada at Christmas!&quot; he exclaimed to Connolly, who reminded him that the conversation had been off the record. &quot;You&apos;re the f&#x2013;king journalist, Connolly, not me,&quot; snorted Lennon.
</p><p>
	&quot;We were all hurt [McCartney] didn&apos;t tell us what he was going to do,&quot; <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lennon-remembers-part-one-186693/" target="_blank">Lennon later told Rolling Stone.</a> &quot;Jesus Christ! He gets all the credit for it! I was a fool not to do what Paul did, which was use it to sell a record&#x2026;&quot;
</p><h2>It all falls apart</h2><p>
	This public fracas had been bubbling under the band&apos;s cheery surface for years. Timing and sales concealed deeper arguments about creative control and the return to live touring.
</p><p>
	In January 1969, the group had started a roots project tentatively titled &quot;Get Back.&quot; It was supposed to be a back-to-the-basics recording without the artifice of studio trickery. But the whole venture was shelved as a new recording, &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; took shape.
</p><p>
	When &quot;Get Back&quot; was eventually revived, Lennon &#x2013; behind McCartney&apos;s back &#x2013; brought in American producer Phil Spector, best known for girl group hits like &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; to salvage the project. But this album was supposed to be band only &#x2013; not embroidered with added strings and voices &#x2013; and McCartney fumed when Spector added a female choir to his song &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot;
</p><p>
	&quot;Get Back&quot; &#x2013; which was renamed &quot;Let it Be&quot; &#x2013; nonetheless moved forward. Spector mixed the album, and a cut of the feature film was readied for summer.
</p><p>
	McCartney&apos;s announcement and release of his solo album effectively short-circuited the plan. By announcing the breakup, he launched his solo career in advance of &quot;Let It Be,&quot; and nobody knew how it might disrupt the official Beatles&apos; project.
</p><p>
	Throughout the remainder of 1970, fans watched in disbelief as the &quot;Let It Be&quot; movie portrayed the hallowed Beatles circling musical doldrums, bickering about arrangements and killing time running through oldies. The film finished with an ironic triumph &#x2013; the famous live set on the roof of their Apple headquarters during which the band played &quot;Get Back,&quot; &quot;Don&apos;t Let Me Down&quot; and a joyous &quot;One After 909.&quot;

</p><p>
	The album, released on May 8, performed well and spawned two hit singles &#x2013; the title track and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; &#x2013; but the group never recorded together again.<br>
</p><p>
	Their fans hoped against hope that four solo Beatles might someday find their way back to the thrills that had enchanted audiences for seven years. These rumors seemed most promising when McCartney joined Lennon for a Los Angeles recording session in <a href="https://longreads.com/2019/06/24/took-you-by-surprise-john-and-pauls-lost-reunion/" target="_blank">1974 with Stevie Wonder</a>. But while they all played on one another&apos;s solo efforts, the four never played a session together again.
</p><p>
	At the beginning of 1970, autumn&apos;s &quot;Come Together&quot;/&quot;Something&quot; single from &quot;Abbey Road&quot; still floated in the Billboard top 20; the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album and film helped extend fervor beyond what the papers reported. For a long time, the myth of the band endured on radio playlists and across several greatest hits compilations, but when John Lennon sang &quot;The dream is over&#x2026;&quot; at the end of his own 1970 solo debut, &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band,&quot; few grasped the lyrics&apos; implacable truth.
</p><p>
	Fans and critics chased every sliver of hope for the &quot;next&quot; Beatles, but few came close to recreating the band&apos;s magic. There were prospects &#x2013; first bands like Three Dog Night, the Flaming Groovies, Big Star and the Raspberries; later, Cheap Trick, the Romantics and the Knack &#x2013; but these groups only aimed at the same heights the Beatles had conquered, and none sported the range, songwriting ability or ineffable chemistry of the Liverpool quartet.
</p><p>
	We&apos;ve been living in the world without Beatles ever since.

            <p>In 1970, Harrison was recording his first solo record and arguably the best by a Beatle, &quot;All things Must Pass.&quot; The session for the song, &quot;The Art of Dying&quot; featured former Beatle Ringo Starr on drums, keyboard legend Billy Preston on keys, virtuoso Eric Clapton on guitar, and was produced by the notorious Phil Spector.<br></p><p>Harrison wanted a conga player for the session, so Ringo&apos;s chauffeur reached out to Phil Collins&apos; manager. At the time, Collins was a relative unknown who was about to join Genesis, a band that would bring him worldwide stardom.</p><p>The 18-year-old Collins was starstruck playing on a session with two former Beatles, so he played extra hard in rehearsals, resulting in blood blisters on both hands.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODE0NDYxNC9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY0MzY1ODM5N30.uAQNbLqB1nMAIlC_iq22Pho9lthbuSvuYzje29nG7rw/img.gif?width=980"><figcaption>

            <p>&quot;Anyway, after about two hours of this, Phil Spector says, &apos;Okay congas, you play this time.&apos; And I&apos;d had my mic off, so everybody laughed, but my hands were shot,&quot; <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1234136/The-Beatles-George-Harrison-All-Things-Must-Pass-drummer-Phil-Collins" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Collins told Express.</a><br></p><p>&quot;And just after that they all disappeared &#x2013; someone said they were watching TV or something &#x2013; and I was told I could go,&quot; after that, Collins was relieved of his duties and told to go home. A few months later, Collins bought the massive triple album in the record shop and was devastated to learn he&apos;d been edited out of the song.</p><p>&quot;There must be some mistake! Collins thought. &quot;But it&apos;s a different version of the song, and I&apos;m not on it.&quot;</p><p>Some thirty years later, Collins bought the home of Formula One driver Jackie Stewart, a close friend of Harrison. Stewart mentioned to Collins that Harrison was remixing &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; for a rerelease.</p><p>&quot;And he said, &apos;You were on it, weren&apos;t you?&apos; And I said, &apos;Well I was there,&quot;&apos; Collins recalled.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODE0NDYxNi9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3OTI3NTUyMn0.Nnl6fARLPCPngd5HljyZjU7Yl5g1eqvv8YKWDomf_8k/img.gif?width=980"><figcaption>

            <p>Two days later, a tape was delivered from Harrison to Collins with a note that read: &quot;Could this be you?&quot; Collins continued: &quot;I rush off and listen to it, and straight away I recognize it.&quot; It was a recording of &quot;The Art of Dying.&quot;<br></p><p>&quot;Suddenly the congas come in &#x2013; too loud and just awful,&quot; Collins was devastated, then as the end of the take, Harrison can be heard saying, &quot;Hey, Phil, can we try another without the conga player?&quot;</p><p>Collins was devastated, to say the least.</p><p>A while later, Stewart calls Collins and puts Harrison on the line. &quot;&apos;Did you get the tape?&apos; Harrison asked. &quot;I now realize I was fired by a Beatle,&quot; Collins sighed. The two changed the subject, but a few minutes later, Harrison couldn&apos;t stop laughing.</p><p>&quot;Don&apos;t worry, it was a piss-take. I got Ray Cooper to play really badly and we dubbed it on,&quot; Harrison admitted. &quot;Thought you&apos;d like it!&quot; So, Harrison had an entire recording session with a conga player who he asked to play poorly, just to pull one over on Collins.</p><figure><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODE0NDYyMi9vcmlnaW4uZ2lmIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NTczNDcwN30.sN_3jtUH3nmpjof0cUkORcbwfyn7yR6Ffcfr_vxdrR8/img.gif?width=980"><figcaption>
