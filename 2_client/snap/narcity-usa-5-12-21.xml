      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Part of Hawaii is under a blizzard warning. Really.</p><p>The National Weather Service (NWS) <a href="https://forecast.weather.gov/wwamap/wwatxtget.php?cwa=hfo&amp;wwa=blizzard%20warning" target="_blank">warns</a> that high winds and heavy snow are coming for the Big Island summits, and things could get pretty nasty over the weekend.</p><p>Up to 12 inches of snow are expected to fall in the area from Friday evening until Sunday morning, according to the NWS.</p><p>Wind gusts are also expected at speeds of up to 100 miles per hour.</p><p>&#x201C;Travel could be very difficult to impossible,&#x201D; the warning says. &#x201C;Blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility at times, with periods of zero visibility.&#x201D;</p><p>The weather agency adds that the strong winds will &#x201C;likely cause significant drifting snow.&#x201D;</p><p>The news will likely not delight vacationers who are trying to escape the frigid winter weather this December, especially since the NWS is recommending that people stay indoors during the storm.</p><p>&#x201C;Travel should be restricted to emergencies only,&#x201D; it said. &#x201C;If you must travel, have a winter survival kit with you. If you get stranded, stay with your vehicle.&quot;</p><p>Hawaii is known to get snow a few times a year, according to the <a href="https://www.southkohala.com/blog/island-information/snow-winter-sports-hawaii" target="_blank">South Kohala Management</a> tourism site.</p><p>The summits of the island&apos;s volcanos typically get the worst of it, with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/snow-hawaiis-mauna-kea-mauna-loa-volcanoes/" target="_blank">8 inches forecast in 2017</a>.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>But it&apos;s not all bad.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Let&#x2019;s be honest; we&#x2019;ve all thought about dropping everything and going on a world tour, but we can never justify it because who&#x2019;s going to pay for it?</p><p> Insuranks, that&#x2019;s who&#x2019;s going to pay for it. The American insurance company is offering a once-in-a-lifetime job opportunity that will take the lucky person who scores the gig through all seven continents for 12 months, as outlined in the <a href="https://www.insuranks.com/careers/dream-job-challenge" target="_blank">job posting</a>.</p><p>The insurance company wants someone to travel the world and test out various kinds of insurance packages like business insurance, international car insurance and travel insurance. They also need the person to create daily content about their travels to increase Insuranks&apos; online presence.</p><p>The company will cover all flights, accommodation, allowance for vehicles, activities, food and drink, while also providing insurance coverage. In total, the individual will receive $85,000 to cover the cost of the year-long travel trip. However, that&#x2019;s all they get. The winner won&#x2019;t receive a salary; instead, the gig pays in the form of the trip itself.</p><p>Essentially, the person gets to<a href="https://www.narcity.com/live-anywhere-on-airbnb-airbnb-is-looking-for-12-people-to-live-anywhere-in-the-world-for-free" target="_blank"> live a year for free</a> while seeing the world simultaneously.</p><p>While on this adventure, the person who scores the job will get to do all sorts of bucket-list experiences such as swimming in the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, seeing the northern lights in Iceland, going on a safari in Africa, dancing at the carnival in Rio de Janeiro and going on a 14-day expedition to Antarctica.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>This trip is not for the faint of heart since the list of planned activities includes swimming with dolphins, skydiving, shark-cage diving and canyon-swinging.</p><p>You get to do all of this while travelling solo and making friends on the way in exchange for daily content in the form of blogs, a daily video diary and photos of your experiences.</p><p>To apply, you have to complete the application at the bottom of the job listing and post a 60-second video on your Instagram on why you would be the perfect fit for the job, tagging a friend along with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/insurankscom/" target="_blank">@insurankscom</a> followed by these hashtags: #Insuranks #DreamJobChallenge.</p><p>You only need to be over 18 and an American resident to apply for the job. The job posting closes on January 31, 2022, and the winner will be selected within 30 days after the application closes. </p><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Alec Baldwin doesn&#x2019;t know how a <a href="https://www.narcity.com/first-lawsuit-against-alec-baldwin-reveals-terrifying-details-about-the-rust-shooting" target="_blank">live round</a> ended up in a prop gun on the set of <em>Rust. </em>But he says he &quot;didn&apos;t pull the trigger.&quot;</p><p>&#x201C;Someone is responsible for what happened, and I can&#x2019;t say who that is, but I know it&#x2019;s not me,&#x201D; the actor told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/alec-baldwin-rust-shooting-responsible/story?id=81490389" target="_blank">ABC News</a> in his first sit-down interview since the deadly shooting on the set of a Western film in October.</p><p>Police are still investigating the incident after Baldwin&#x2019;s prop gun went off during rehearsal, hitting two people with one real bullet. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died from the gunshot, while director Joel Souza suffered a shoulder wound.</p><p>Baldwin says he dreams about the shooting &#x201C;constantly&#x201D; although he doesn&#x2019;t feel any personal guilt about it.</p><p>&#x201C;I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible, and I don&apos;t say that lightly,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Baldwin told ABC that he doesn&#x2019;t know why the gun went off.</p><p>The actor was sitting in a church pew and practicing his gun draw at the time of the shooting. Hutchins and Souza were lining up the scene close by, and Baldwin was supposed to draw his gun across his body and point it at the camera, according to <a href="https://www.narcity.com/police-found-alec-baldwin-deadly-bullet-all-options-are-on-the-table-for-charges" target="_blank">documented accounts</a> of the case.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>Baldwin says the scene called for him to cock the hammer of the gun &#x2014; not to actually fire it.</p><p>&#x201C;She&apos;s guiding me through how she wants me to hold the gun for this angle,&#x201D; he said, referring to Hutchins.</p><p>&#x201C;I cock the gun. I go, &#x2018;Can you see that?&#x2019;&#x201D; Baldwin said. &#x201C;And then I let go of the hammer of the gun, and the gun goes off.&#x201D;</p><p>He added: &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t pull the trigger.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Everyone is horrified, they&#x2019;re shocked, it&#x2019;s loud,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>Baldwin says he immediately thought that Hutchins had fainted, and he didn&#x2019;t even think that the prop gun might&#x2019;ve been loaded with a live round until 45 minutes later.</p><p>He ultimately found out that Hutchins had died after going to the sheriff&#x2019;s office. </p><p>&#x201C;They said to me, &#x2018;We regret to tell you that [Hutchins] didn&apos;t make it,&#x2019;&#x201D; Baldwin told ABC. &#x201C;They told me right then and there.&#x201D;</p><p>The actor added that he doesn&apos;t know when or if he&apos;ll ever act again, but &quot;can&#x2019;t imagine&quot; doing another movie with a gun in it.</p><p>&#x201C;I couldn&apos;t give a sh*t about my career anymore,&#x201D; he said.</p><p>The in-depth interview touched on many details about the shooting, including lawsuits that were filed after the incident.</p><p>No one has been criminally charged in the shooting at this point.</p><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It may not be too long before you walk into your local Starbucks and grab a coffee without speaking to a single person.</p><p>The coffee chain is testing out a new store concept in New York City called Starbucks Pickup with Amazon Go.</p><p><a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2021/starbucks-pickup-and-amazon-go-collaborate-to-launch-new-store-concept-in-new-york-city/" target="_blank">A press release by the coffee brand</a> explained how the store uses a combination of features like the Starbucks app to order ahead and Amazon Go&#x2019;s walk-out technology, which allows you to pick up a coffee without speaking to a cashier or standing in line.</p><p>The store opened on November 18 and the reviews are already coming in from those who&apos;ve tried it. It&apos;s located on 59th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenue.</p><div class="rm-shortcode" data-height data-rm-shortcode-id="838e99dfa6ef6ddf024e253827dd9398" data-thumbnail data-width id="ce9e5">

</div><p class="media-body"></p><p>For those who want to go to a coffee shop to get some work done or chat with a friend, the store also has a fully updated lounge that features individual workspaces and more extensive work tables. You also don&#x2019;t need to worry about finding power outlets and USB ports because this store has you covered in that department.</p><p>The store will also feature items from the Amazon Go market, including fresh salads and sandwiches in addition to the Starbucks menu.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>Ordering drinks is pretty straightforward as the process isn&#x2019;t that different from using the Starbucks app for in-store pickup.</p><p> However, you have a few options when buying from the Amazon Go Market. You can either use the &#x201C;in-Store Code&#x201D; from the Amazon app, Amazon One or a credit card. Then you can proceed to shop as per usual.</p><p>Everything you take off the shelf will be added to your virtual cart, and your account gets charged when you leave the store.</p><p>If the store proves to be a success in New York City, it might not be long until we see similar stores popping up across the U.S. and in Canada.</p><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Omicron variant has officially arrived in the United States and the White House is urging everyone who&apos;s eligible to <a href="https://www.narcity.com/the-omicron-variant-might-need-a-new-vaccine-heres-how-long-well-have-to-wait-for-one" target="_blank">get vaccinated</a> ASAP.</p><p>The White House and the CDC confirmed the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1201-omicron-variant.html" target="_blank">first U.S. case of COVID-19</a> caused by the new COVID-19 variant on Wednesday, one week after public health experts warned that it was becoming a problem in South Africa.</p><p>The first case was found in an infected person who returned to California from South Africa on November 22, according to the White House. That person tested positive for COVID-19 on November 29.</p><p>&quot;This is the first confirmed case of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant detected in the United States,&quot; Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, said at a <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1OyJADzvnvnGb" target="_blank">briefing on Wednesday afternoon</a>.</p><p>&quot;We knew that it was just a matter of time.&quot;</p><p>Fauci added that the infected person was fully vaccinated and that they are self-quarantining with mild symptoms.</p><p>Officials have also traced his close contacts and all of them have tested negative at this point, Fauci said.</p><p>Omicron was first reported to WHO on <a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern" target="_blank">November 24</a> and there are concerns that it may spread faster and be more resistant to vaccines than other variants. The World Health Organization gave it a name and labelled it a &quot;<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern" target="_blank">variant of concern</a>&quot; on November 26.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>Studies are underway to figure out exactly what this heavily mutated version of the virus can do, but in the meantime, many countries have added travel restrictions in hopes of keeping the variant out.</p><p>Fauci says it&apos;ll be a few weeks before the world gets a better sense of how the Omicron variant behaves.</p><p>The Omicron variant has been detected in South Africa and Botswana, and it&apos;s been spotted in travellers to over two dozen countries around the world, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/health/coronavirus-variant-tracker.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> reports.</p><p>&#x201C;We know what we need to do to protect people,&quot; Fauci said. &quot;Get vaccinated if you&#x2019;re not already vaccinated. Get boosted if you&#x2019;ve been vaccinated for more than 6 months with an mRNA.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;If you look at the things that we have been recommending, they&#x2019;re just the same,&quot; he added.</p><p><em>The CDC has a robust website with all the latest <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html" target="_blank">information on COVID-19 vaccines</a> and can answer any questions you may have.</em></p><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>

In fact, it was gone for so long that the library had even lost record of owning it, according to <a href="https://www.kivitv.com/news/it-was-pretty-overdue-boise-library-book-returned-110-years-after-being-checked-out" target="_blank">Idaho News 6</a>.</p><p>The library shared the news on their Facebook page, where they revealed that the individual who checked the book out would have owed the library over US$800 had the library not become fine-free in 2019.</p><div class="fb-post"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/boisepublib/posts/10159736254418373" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"></blockquote></div>&quot;<p>&quot;With a fine of two cents per day for 111 years, whoever checked out this book would owe $803,&quot; the caption read. &quot;Thank goodness the Boise Public Libraries are now fine free!&quot; </p><p>The reason why it took 111 years for the book to make its back to the library is a mystery. </p><p>&quot;You know you kind of wondered what its story was and how it ended up there. Was it in somebody&apos;s box, did somebody pass away, did they move you know, what happened? We&apos;ll never know but you could imagine all types of fun stories about it,&quot; library assistant Anne Marie Martin told Idaho News 6.</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>The book was initially returned to the Garden City Library, but it was transferred to the Boise branch because that&apos;s where it was originally checked out.</p><p>When it finally made its way back to its original home, library workers realized just how overdue the book was. </p><p>Finding out who checked out the book is almost impossible, given that all paper records from that time are gone.</p><p>Despite not knowing what happened to the book over the past 100 years, one thing is for sure: whoever had it took great care of it as it&apos;s still in great condition.</p><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>

They also didn&apos;t say anything about a potential motive.</p><p>Witnesses said it was a terrifying experience to see the SUV drive through the crowd.</p><p>&quot;It was the worst thing I&apos;ve ever seen in my life,&quot; Tyler Kotlarek, 28, told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/21/us/wisconsin-parade-crash.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>.</p><p>&quot;He was going from side to side, targeting people,&quot; Kotlarek said. &quot;He was flying through there going intentionally from left to right.&quot;</p><p>The City of Waukesha live-streamed the parade on its Facebook page, and the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cityofwaukesha/videos/445274323778655/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZU8l28oWuJDs1YdezQbmdoUxxa1FEbusNXgTVA4mMq_Kufe3kmmMyds1prQgz1b6-8kEte7sI0T2W-WqcMDSkpKtJrHVOyOaRDUuRhtpqmdTQD3owd2s0zY37oN7SuETrZQFpHA0O-7VJ5n7NQe_NLw9SX2nVTPlVmPP6185lAG0A&amp;__tn__=%2CO-R" target="_blank">video</a> shows the SUV speeding down the parade route.

And people started rushing, running away with tears in their eyes, crying.&quot;</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>Chris Germain, who was driving a float in the parade, says the SUV &quot;blazed right past us&quot; and that an officer was running along after it.</p><p>The victims were not immediately identified but some of them belonged to a group called the Dancing Grannies, the AP reports.</p><p>Police are investigating the case and an update is expected on Monday afternoon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

That means the mansion will go back to being a human home in the near future, assuming that someone agrees to pay the $31.75 million asking price.</p><p>The millionaire German shepherd owes his estimated net worth of nearly $500 million to his ancestor, Gunther III, who inherited a vast fortune from his owner, a German countess, when she died in 1992, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sports-oddities-entertainment-lifestyle-europe-c1629fb79b02fe67392922687c2bf2fa?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP_Oddities&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP_Oddities&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter" target="_blank">Associated Press</a> reports.</p><p>German countess Karlotta Liebenstein left about $100 million to her dog when she died, and the dog&apos;s appointed caretakers invested that cash so that it grew to almost five times the original amount. They also bought him Madonna&apos;s old villa for $7.5 million back in 2000.</p><p>Those caretakers decided to sell Gunther&apos;s home this year, meaning he&apos;ll soon be living in the lap of luxury somewhere else.</p><p>The home itself is a Tuscan-style villa on Biscayne Bay in Miami. It features nine bedrooms, 8.5 bathrooms and nearly 8,000 square feet of space, and it sits on a 1.17-acre lot, according to the listing. </p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>Oh, and it&apos;s pet friendly. Obviously.</p><p>The virtual tour video offers a great look at the home and at the filthy rich dog who owns it.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube">

</div><p class="media-body">The first red flag involves the family photo shoot: &quot;One of the spouses will take more than three family photos without the other spouse.&quot;</p><p>&quot;This one kind of makes sense to me,&quot; she added. &quot;You might get a few alone with your mom and dad, but to kick [the spouse] out of more than three photos just seems a little suspicious.&quot;</p><p>The second red flag has to do with the wedding party: &quot;The bridesmaids or the groomsmen will avoid talking about the spouse while they&apos;re getting ready or doing toasts or anything,&quot; she said. &quot;That&apos;s typically because they don&apos;t like them.&quot;</p><p>Finally, the third sign of trouble is that one spouse &quot;will spend more time with friends or family at the reception rather than their spouse.&quot;</p><div id="pressboard-ad-sponsorship-msg2"></div><p>The video has gone viral and TikTok users have chimed in with their own experiences.</p><p>&quot;Yep. My EX husband didn&apos;t spend time [with] me at the wedding and his groomsmen didn&apos;t even say hi to me at all,&quot; says the top comment with more than 1,300 likes.</p><p>&quot;My ex husband wanted to spend time with his brother on our wedding night and not me,&quot; another added.</p><p>&quot;Wedding photographer here: YEP,&quot; read one comment.</p><p>Others argued that you need to spend time with your guests at the reception, and that sometimes you have big families that require more than three group photos.</p><p>&quot;You&apos;re supposed to also be a good host,&quot; one user wrote. &quot;I spent my whole wedding running around making sure everyone was having fun.&quot;</p><p>Other users added their own red flags, such as tension with the new in-laws or smushing cake in the spouse&apos;s face.</p><p>Of course, none of these mean a marriage is totally doomed from the start.</p><p>&quot;All three occurred at mine,&quot; one user wrote in the comments. &quot;20 years and [we&apos;re] still good.&quot;</p><p><em>This article&#x2019;s right-hand cover image was used for illustrative purposes only.</em></p><div class="around-the-web"><h4>Next Up</h4>
