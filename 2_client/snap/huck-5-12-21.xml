					<description><![CDATA[Director Theo Anthony discusses his latest film, which investigates the shared history of cameras, weapons, policing and justice.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking back at his 2017 feature debut, </span><a href="https://memory.is/rat-film"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rat Film</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Theo Anthony thinks of the project – an interrogation of racism, poverty, and resource allocation – as his way “to explore the topology” of Baltimore, Maryland (the place he grew up in). “It was this earnest way I tried to understand the history of the city, and my own place in it,” he says, noting “huge disparities in race, class and geography” and its propensity for “militarised technology”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his latest experimental documentary, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Light, Everywhere</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the filmmaker digs into that technology, questioning the utility of constant surveillance – through CCTV, body cameras, even photographic identification – in Baltimore and far beyond. Turning the lens onto the lens itself, Anthony explores the ways in which both the still and moving image have been effectively weaponised and co-opted by eugenicists through time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the film’s prominent, more contemporary threads is an evaluation of police body-cam footage and its use as an ‘objective’ tool. Over the course of the film, we learn that not only are police officers allowed to review footage of an incident before giving sworn statements, but that its wide-angle lens makes people appear closer than they are, and their movements more exaggerated. </span></p>
<p><iframe title="ALL LIGHT, EVERYWHERE - Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/luHmSqY0Xsk?start=46&#038;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Light, Everywhere,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Anthony uses his camera to surveil groups who are not nearly as accustomed to being surveilled themselves. As a result, many of his subjects give uncanny, revealing performances, often inadvertently telling on themselves. In one scene, Anthony meets a man whose role it is to operate an </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">airplane-mounted camera to track movement on city streets. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I believe god sees everything,” he says, while allowing himself the godly privilege of an omniscient aerial view. Anthony also films an officer leading a Baltimore Police Department training session, who encourages his peers to manipulate the narrative of potential altercations with their body cam footage while simultaneously claiming that “cameras don’t take sides”. In another scene, Steve Tuttle, a spokesperson for Axon, a company that produces – ominously enough – both body cameras and electric Tasers, remarks: “There are no secrets here”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In moments like these, the case for abolition is subtly but powerfully implied. “This idea of policing as the institution that preserves law and order is a myth,” says the filmmaker. “It’s a very carefully-constructed myth to protect private property, prevent meaningful change by making surface level concessions.” </span></p>
<p><em>Huck</em> caught up with Anthony to discuss how he managed to get his subjects to agree to being filmed, the insidious nature of our modern surveillance age, and the film’s guiding principles.</p>
<p><b>How would you describe what this film is about? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Light, Everywhere</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a film about vision. I think it&#8217;s about the infrastructure of vision, how power manifests in images, and how institutions use those images. It tries to be a deeper history of all those things, including how that manifests in the present quite literally, through me making the film you’re seeing.</span></p>
<p><b>What first got you interested in those sorts of subjects? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I have always been investigating different relationships between the subject and filmmaker and trying to interrogate the ways in which the camera shapes that dynamic. I always found it pretty obnoxious that we weren’t talking about the most obvious thing in the room; the camera was the reason why we were there. I lived in Eastern Congo for six months, reporting for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">VICE</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and others. I&#8217;m there to manufacture images and there&#8217;s no real interrogation, at least on my end, or my contractor&#8217;s end, of why I’m the one telling this story. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That really just carried on through the making of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rat Film</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which I think explores a lot of similar themes. Its really come from practice in the sense of just me coming up with these questions as I was in the field and understanding my own presence, in my body and the camera.</span></p>
<p><b>Watching the film I can’t help but wonder: was part of your motivation just to put a camera on these awful people, to sort of see how they like it? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were very much interested in making a film that would literally just turn the camera around on the people and institutions who were behind some of this technology. I think there&#8217;s a lot of very abstract, disconnected conversation and capital ‘D’ discourse that doesn&#8217;t really look at the particularities of how this stuff plays out, and I’m always interested in the details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am constantly reading things and ingesting media, and sometimes things just stick. The body cameras were one of those things. After [Freddie Gray&#8217;s] killing, there was a Department of Justice consent decree, and one of their main mandates was to implement a body-camera program. Reading more about it, I found out that they were also the company that made these tasers, and that connection really stuck with me.</span></p>
<p><b>I think the way you show some of those people up (inadvertently or otherwise) does make for quite a satisfying watch. There’s a kind of mocking humour in your editing choices I was hoping you could say more about.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter who I film with, I try to really walk them through what I want them to do, get their feedback and include them as much as possible in the framing of the image. This is while also understanding that it still doesn’t mean there’s a level playing field. I&#8217;m still behind the camera, they’re still in front of the camera, but it&#8217;s something I try to be as explicit about as possible. When it’s someone who I disagree with, like Steve [Tuttle], they will still have our shot list, our questions, and we’ll walk him through it. But Steve’s job is to essentially perform propaganda, and that was something that we really wanted to lean into. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We watched every interview he&#8217;d ever done, we watched all his corporate materials, and – when designing the shoot – based our entire shot list on things that he had already done and would therefore be comfortable doing again. So we were trying to be very true to the image that [these companies] had put out in the world, but also trying to shift the context just enough that people are able to look at it critically.</span></p>
<p><b>Did you have to be opaque about your intentions at all to get these interviews, or even just the police training footage?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s obviously strategic ways you present information, but I would never lie. When you’re talking about this technology, what’s key is the way that it’s pitched to the public; that it&#8217;s going to increase transparency, and through that transparency, you can have greater accountability for government institutions. Of course, much of this technology that is supposed to make things more transparent actually just makes them more opaque. But when we are approaching the Baltimore Police Department, for instance, we are able to lean into that access, or we’re able to use that idea of transparency. Either they grant us that and they&#8217;re fulfilling that promise, or they don&#8217;t, and appear critical to that very mandate. We say, ‘Hey, if you believe in transparency, we&#8217;d love to have access. And if you’re not granting us access to this, why is that?’</span></p>
<p><b>As a white filmmaker, did you have any hesitations in terms of being the right person to tell this story, which has so many ties to race and Blackness specifically?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that was the conversation. In my work now I am trying to be very conscious of the fact that I’m not speaking for anyone else&#8217;s experience, I try to check myself to ensure I&#8217;m not making any assumptions, or explaining something about someone else’s experience. There’s this really great essay by this writer/philosopher, Édouard Glissant, about the “right to opacity” that was one of our guiding principles for this. It speaks all about the right of colonised people to maintain a sense of opacity in the light of a penetrating colonial gaze. Opacity can actually be this revolutionary, liberating act. The film&#8217;s title itself is kind of a self-own in some ways: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">All Light, Everywhere</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We were constantly asking, where does this light reach? Where are these pockets of opacity? </span></p>
<p><b>What would you say the meaning of the film’s title is in that case?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It really comes from al-Kindi, this 9th Century Persian philosopher-polymath who translated a lot of Greek texts and put them in dialogue with Islam. He has this really beautiful line about Plato&#8217;s theory of vision, which was this extra-mission theory; this idea that light emanated from the eyes and tied together the world; that the world was literally tied together by all light, everywhere. Light, not only enabling visibility, but also binding the world together, was a central image for us throughout. And then of course, in the context of surveillance, all light everywhere really might not be such a good thing. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Following the institution revealing that it plans to cut at least 52 jobs, staff have organised a three-week walkout over redundancies with students standing in solidarity with them. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Casual contracts, precarious employment, and juggling multiple jobs to make ends meet are not phrases instinctively associated with academia. Yet thousands of lecturers, researchers and general staff at British universities are struggling under hourly, pitifully-paid work contracts. It is a phenomenon that has skyrocketed over the past decade: according to the UCU, </span><a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/stampout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">over half</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of universities and colleges use zero-hour contracts to deliver teaching – yet this remains relatively unknown. </span><a href="https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/10/university-workers-are-fighting-for-the-future-of-higher-education"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> dub it the sector’s “dirty secret”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a secret that Jacob Mukherjee, a lecturer in Media, Communications and Cultural Studies at Goldsmiths, knows all too well. “I’ve been an academic since 2014, and for the first seven years, I was on casualised contracts,” he tells </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huck</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. “Fixed term, temporary, insecure contracts, often hourly-paid.” Mukherjee says people don’t realise how ubiquitous these are in higher education; essentially a pre-ordained “rite of passage” to attain the holy grail of a permanent position</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “You might get a three-month contract, and get paid to teach ten weeks during that period, earning, say, £2,000. And that’s the whole year’s payment you get from that institution. You’re earning very, very little money.” </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457951" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1773.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1773.jpg 1000w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1773-326x489.jpg 326w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1773-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457941" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682.jpg 2250w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682-734x489.jpg 734w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1682-402x267.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s a perilously-thin tightrope that staff must wobble along: balancing multiple, temporary jobs; intractable financial insecurity; an inability to plan ahead, save, or even get a mortgage or pension. For some, it has meant scraping together extra cash as a cleaner. Others have visited food banks. Still more have abandoned academia altogether. For Mukherjee, it meant fraught periods working at multiple institutions, racing across London on his bike to get from one class to another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But casual contracts are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the injustices pervading the UK’s academic institutions. Untenable workloads, staff cuts, and slashed pensions are other blights that have driven university staff across the country to strike in recent years. Jo Brady, UCU general secretary, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/24/new-university-job-cuts-fuel-rising-outrage-on-campuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">warned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the workforce was at “breaking point”. She added: “Pay has been cut by 17 per cent, a typical member’s pension has been slashed by £24,000, and left-right-and-centre staff are being exploited by casual contracts.” </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457948" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1746.jpg" alt="" width="1800" height="1200" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1746.jpg 1800w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1746-734x489.jpg 734w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1746-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1746-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1746-402x267.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It speaks to something wider that’s happening at British universities: the commercialisation of higher education. Student fees have replaced government funding. Courses are ranked by their money-making ability rather than their academic potential. Students are consumers not learners. Staff are seen as transient, inherently replaceable employees. Loans were tripled, then sold to private companies that act as debt collectors sending red-letter warnings to students threatening interest hikes. There has been a systemic shift over the past decade in how universities are run: profit-making machines, rather than places to foster critical thinking and academic excellence, a formative space where staff and students can explore, expand, and evolve together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last few years have seen a spate of UCU strikes. Earlier in November, 58 universities voted in favour of more. Under the UCU’s umbrella, staff are calling for the elimination of casual contracts, pay increases, and more manageable workloads. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tumult at Goldsmiths began at the start of the pandemic. The university announced it would not renew the temporary contracts that over 400 staff, including Mukherjee, were on at the time. Mukherjee joined the union’s campaign, undertaking a grades assessment boycott to urge the university to renew contracts. It worked. Many kept their jobs, including Mukherjee, who is now in full-time employment. But relief was fleeting. 52 compulsory redundancies were announced in September, spanning general administrators and the humanities. </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457945" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733.jpg" alt="" width="2250" height="1500" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733.jpg 2250w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733-734x489.jpg 734w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1733-402x267.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 2250px) 100vw, 2250px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is part of Goldsmith’s </span><a href="https://www.gold.ac.uk/staff-students/info/recovery/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Recovery Programme”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: floundering under a £10m financial deficit and pummelled by Covid-19 and government funding cuts, the university is now attempting to claw back £6m through redundancies. However, given the higher education sector was valued at around £41.9bn in 2019-20, it is reprehensible that staff should be paid so abysmally and forced into increasingly casualised work. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, 2,600 academics and notable writers signed a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/oct/24/new-university-job-cuts-fuel-rising-outrage-on-campuses"><span style="font-weight: 400;">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> calling on Goldsmiths to “halt the decimation” of its humanities departments, warning that academics with “deeply rooted” expertise in Black and Queer History and Black Literature are among those in peril.  It postulates that these roles will be filled by “cheaper, precarious staff”. Goldsmiths established the world’s first Queer History MA and runs the UK’s only Black British History and Black British Literature MAs. The letter’s recriminations include managers running higher education like “fast fashion” and showing “utter disregard for the integrity of the education they want to sell”. Following on from this, a</span>t the <a href="https://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2021/11/goldsmiths-lecturers-vote-for-strike-action-in-battle-with-management-over-job-cuts/">start of November</a>, Goldsmiths lecturers voted for strike action lasting for up to three weeks from 23 November to 13 December.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevenka Martin is among the impending redundancies. For 16 years, she’s been the History Department&#8217;s Business Manager. In her words a “broad role”, she oversees a dizzying plethora of activity: assessments, finances, HR issues, strategic development. In September, she received an email stating her role would be “deleted” and should this cause her any concern, it was suggested that she join a “wellbeing workshop”. “It’s a horrid feeling, because after 16 years of commitment to this institution – and I love my job, my department, my colleagues, students – you get something like that [email] and it makes you feel hugely undervalued,” she says. “Then it made me furious. And I thought, OK, you can delete my role, but you can’t delete my voice – and I became very vocal about it.” She now calls herself an “accidental activist”. </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457953" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A8353.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A8353.jpg 1000w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A8353-326x489.jpg 326w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A8353-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of Goldsmiths perennial charm for Martin was the vibe on campus: the collegiality, the happy, quirky students. But in recent days, the atmosphere has shifted. “Staff are hugely demoralised,” she explains. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.” The malaise has spread to students, too. “People were deflated, coming back after a year of online teaching and hearing our department might be gone by March,” says Sarah Warsama, a third-year BA History student. “It’s hard to work when we’re so on edge about what’s going to happen. I’ll be researching for an essay, thinking, ‘My lecturer might be sacked and this won’t be marked by them, so should I write it differently so it’s easier for a lecturer from a different department to mark?’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Warsama is one of hundreds of students who have come out in force to support staff on the picket lines. A silver lining in the dark cloud hanging over campus has been the solidarity between staff and students. This has greater poignancy when viewed in light of students’ chaotic experience of higher education over the past year, from constant strikes to forking out £9,000 for online-only-teaching. During the first week of the strike, the atmosphere has been part anger, part celebration. There have been moments of real joy and unity. Music students waged a musical protest. Art students crafted banners subverting the logos of Lloyds and Natwest. There have been poetry readings, bhangra workout sessions, DJs, impassioned speeches from staff and students. The Student Union has worked closely alongside the GUCU to mobilise students, compile leaflets, and build a programme of ‘teach-outs’. These workshops – featuring sessions on everything from feminist ethnographies to zine-making  – are an effort to continue learning despite the halt in teaching. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the impetus for student solidarity is the close relationships many have with their lecturers, and the negligible ones with management. Some believe they’re defending the Goldsmiths they love: the creative, open and radical institution. There’s also anger. “We’re really peeved to think we pay so much money, and that money has gone to KPMG and Lloyds and Natwest, and we don’t even have printers in the library. And now they’re telling us our departments will be shut,” says Warsama. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The bank loans are a meaty bone of contention at Goldsmiths. “The role of the banks is really insidious and sets a dangerous precedent,” Mukherjee says. “In a nutshell, Lloyds and Natwest have loaned money with several restrictive and alarming conditions attached. The collateral put up for the loans is literally the university. You’ve got financial institutions running a university which should be run on educational grounds, according to what’s best for students and staff, rather than what’s going to deliver profits for a bank.”</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457942" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1703.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="1500" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1703.jpg 1000w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1703-326x489.jpg 326w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/O55A1703-768x1152.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a statement, Goldsmiths said: </span><span class="s1">“The unavoidable reality is that we have to make further savings to deal with significant financial challenges including an underlying deficit, over 10m of additional costs and lost income due to Covid-19, government cuts that see the College lose over £2m in funding every year, and a decline in the overall number of students studying some subjects. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to reassure our students that we are putting their learning, their experience, and their outcomes first as we build a new and sustainable future for the College.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For now, the focus on the picket lines is ending compulsory redundancies. Mukherjee is confident. “What I most hope students take from this experience is to see you don’t have to accept insecure contracts, being laid off, poor treatment: you can stand up against these things collectively and fight them. Many of our students will be going into precarious, poorly paid work,” he says. “I want them to join unions, to organise, to get better treatment for themselves. And I think if we can show them we can do that, and we can win, in a way that’s the best lesson we can impart.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Justin Yates and Sharn Mahoney are part of a new generation of bikers: one that wants to share the high-octane beauty of the sport with as many people as possible.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over half a million people live in Manchester. Home to football stadiums and a growing skyline of high-rises, it has a rich industrial heritage and a sprawling city centre. But it’s also a gateway to outstanding areas of natural beauty: rolling hills, lakes and waterfalls exist just a few miles from the city centre, while in the east, ancient forests and mountain summits give way to the endless moors of the Peak District. Geographically, the city centre and the natural world couldn’t be better connected, but for many of the city&#8217;s inhabitants – particularly its minority communities – the gap couldn’t be wider. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was a relatively recent but formative discovery for 49-year-old salesman <a href="https://www.instagram.com/scooby82r/?hl=en">Justin Yates</a>. He tried mountain biking (MTB) six years ago, on the advice of friends. The aim was to lose a few pounds and improve his motor-racing skills, but what he found was a sport that changed his life. After doing a few trails, Justin realised he had stumbled on an activity so thrilling that he couldn’t help but return to it over and over again. In conversation, Justin’s sense of enthusiasm is palpable. “You set off and you’re climbing up a hill for 30 minutes which is knackering,” he says. “But then [coming down], it’s like being on a toboggan run. Jumping onto a mountain bike; people don’t understand when I tell them it’s more exciting, more dangerous, more exhilarating than racing a super bike because trees don’t move. If you’re flying through the air at 30mph and you hit a tree… that can be very dangerous.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457920" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-2-copy.jpg" alt="" width="854" height="1280" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-2-copy.jpg 854w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-2-copy-326x489.jpg 326w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-2-copy-768x1151.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It wasn’t just mountain biking that Justin connected with, but the areas it brought him to and the power of the natural landscape. “As a kid, I never really bothered with the outdoors apart from playing football, that was all that was offered to me” he says. “I think for certain ethnic minorities growing up, your primary focus in sport is football or athletics, whereas if you’re from a white background it’s more varied – swimming, cycling, skiing, snowboarding; there&#8217;s more offered and more available to white culture. It wasn’t until I started mountain biking that I discovered Saddleworth Moor, the Peak District; these places that are on my doorstep. It’s been a real eye-opener.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The scenery is breathtaking” he continues. “Seeing a view with mountains, trees, forest land and no cars or telegraph poles; it’s phenomenal. It’s balancing. It does so much for your mental health. Working in sales can be extremely stressful and it’s very good stress relief.”  </span></p>
<p><iframe title="vimeo-player" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/648630409?h=9432a98c26" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a self-confessed “petrol head”, Justin found cars long before bikes, and in his early 20s he started building and racing kit cars, which eventually led to racing superbikes. “Everybody in the paddock who races rides a bike too; a road bike or a mountain bike. I didn’t. A lot of the lads would say to me, ‘You need to do some sort of road biking to trim down and help your racing.’” Following their advice, Justin started riding a mountain bike, at first around local canals and parks, before moving onto bike trail centres. “That’s when I really experienced it,” he says. “Hundreds of people on bikes and a set trail with jumps, turns, burns, drops – I was instantly hooked! It’s so much more full-on than motorbikes; it’s so much more visceral.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Manchester is not unique in its proximity to green spaces. 200 miles away in London, 25-year-old <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ridewithsharn/?hl=en">Sharn Mahoney</a> echoes many of Justin’s experiences. I meet her outside the Olympic Park Velodrome where a network of bike routes intersect. In a city location, I’m surprised to see the stoney rough terrain and overgrown grass that hides the narrow trails. I’m even more surprised to hear that there&#8217;s eight kilometres of routes like this, dedicated to mountain biking. Some veer off at sharp angles before disappearing up and down small but steep hills, another heads west, crossing the River Lea into miles of woodland. All look equally inviting. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457923" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-3-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="949" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-3-copy.jpg 1280w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-3-copy-660x489.jpg 660w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-3-copy-768x569.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can you believe it?” says Sharn. “I went to school around here, I went to Westfield shopping centre all the time, and I had no idea you could come here and do mountain biking. I guess there&#8217;s a divide between the residents [that live here] and the wealth that is being pumped into the area; it was never advertised to us.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She makes a compelling argument. Sharn is a woman who has been into sports and fitness her whole life. She loves trying her hand at new activities; she’s happy to spend money on classes, and is both a keen dancer and gymnast. When you also factor in that she grew up in Newham, a stone&#8217;s throw away from the Olympic Stadium, you realise that she is exactly the kind of person the park should have been marketed towards. Instead, it took her almost another decade to realise it even existed. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457928" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-01.jpg" alt="" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-01.jpg 1366w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-01-870x489.jpg 870w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-01-617x347.jpg 617w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-01-353x199.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My Mum told us that they did family days out here where you could rent a bike, so she suggested we all go,” Sharn explains. “That was in 2019. I don’t even know how she found out about it.” Like Justin, Sharn says she didn&#8217;t have much of a relationship with the outdoors before mountain biking. After her first session with her family, she took to watching videos of the sport rather than trying out more trails. “I lived it through YouTube; in my head I was there. I did that for a year, just watching people go round the trails. I didn’t think about coming back here until the lockdown happened and my friend invited me to go with him. That second time I loved it so much that I decided to get a new bike, and that was it. I started travelling; I&#8217;d go to Epping Forest and Swinley Forest, I’d go to pump tracks, I&#8217;d fall off and hurt myself but nothing stopped me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In mountain biking, it’s clear that both Justin and Sharn have found a sport they can no longer imagine their life without. “I’ll admit sometimes it’s scary,” says Sharn. “It’s scary when it’s rainy or it’s muddy. It’s scary when you get to the top of a hill and you look down and think, ‘I have to get down </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">?! What if I flip over the handlebars?!’ But that fear is what makes it so exciting. It’s such an adrenaline rush, it’s fast, it’s thrilling, it feels like being on a roller coaster. You end up feeling so excited; it doesn’t feel like exercise. That’s what I love about it.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457922" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-copy.jpg" alt="" width="874" height="1280" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-copy.jpg 874w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-copy-334x489.jpg 334w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-copy-768x1125.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 874px) 100vw, 874px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this happens in a sublime setting so far removed from day-to-day life. Mountain biking has brought Sharn and Justin to locations which they never knew existed – both on their doorsteps and further afield. “Bike Park Wales is my favourite” says Sharn. “It’s just beautiful. The views, the valleys, the blue skies, the hills, the mountains. I felt like I was on holiday. You’re so high up, you feel like you could touch the clouds&#8230; you don’t get that where I’m from.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many others in the MTB community, they have discovered that outdoor sports can provide a unique antidote to the pressures of modern living, even for those who live in the middle of a sprawling metropolis. That said, it’s no coincidence that Sharn and Justin didn’t discover mountain biking until their 20s and 40s respectively. Like so many other outdoor sports, people of colour seem to be largely absent from the MTB demographic. </span><a href="https://www.singletracks.com/uncategorized/newsflash-the-sport-of-mountain-biking-lacks-diversity/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a 2016 survey</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by online mountain biking community, Singletracks, more than 90 per cent of its readers identified as Caucasian. </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457921" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-6-copy.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="901" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-6-copy.jpg 1280w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-6-copy-695x489.jpg 695w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-1-6-copy-768x541.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin describes his experience as a person of colour in an overwhelmingly white space as frustrating. “Since I was 26 and got my first kit car, I&#8217;ve always forced myself into areas where I’m the only black person, so I suppose I’m attuned to it, but it does disappoint me because I know how fun it is. If other people who looked like me had the opportunity, or if it was shown to them, they’d love it just as much as I do.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Sharn, much of the issue lies in representation. “It’s psychology,” she says. “People need to see someone who looks like them to feel welcome and comfortable doing something. I can’t say I only see white people when I go out, for sure they’re the majority but I do see other people of colour too, so we’re definitely into it. I just don’t think we’re being shown. Brands and media platforms need to put campaigns in places where we will see it, because we have just as much purchasing power as white people. Even if you live in [the inner city] you can drive to a place or cycle there. My community is great, it doesn&#8217;t deserve to get left behind.”</span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457927" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-02.jpg" alt="" width="1366" height="768" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-02.jpg 1366w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-02-870x489.jpg 870w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-02-617x347.jpg 617w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Dicovery-Quotes-02-353x199.jpg 353w" sizes="(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px" /><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a government report titled </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/693158/25-year-environment-plan.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Green Future</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, spending time in the natural environment improves “mental health and feelings of wellbeing”. It can reduce stress, fatigue, anxiety and depression, boost immune systems, encourage physical activity, and may reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as asthma. For many people living in an urban environment, it’s taken a global pandemic to recognise not just the value, but the disproportionate access different communities have to natural spaces. Race places a huge factor in access to the outdoors. The majority of people of colour in the UK live in urban areas; that includes 98.2 per cent of the Black African and 97.9 per cent of the Black Caribbean populations. When we consider the impact proximity to nature has on our mental and physical health, the fight for equal access to the outdoor world becomes even more crucial. “I was a bit annoyed at myself, that I had all this on my doorstep but I knew nothing about it,” says Justin. “MTB isn’t a secret thing, but it’s not advertised. Certain people are into it and they kind of keep it to themselves. It is a predominantly white sport.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s through social media that Justin first met Sharn, and after connecting online, the pair struck up a friendship and realised they shared a goal to improve access to the sport for minority communities. Having waited so long to experience the magic of MTB themselves, they’re now doing everything they can to encourage new people to give it a go – and they both put up a compelling case for newcomers. “I will ride with anyone!” promises Justin. “On social media if you start looking, there are a few people of colour who ride. If you drop them a message, they will want to come and ride with you. I want to get a bit of a network together and that’s the start.” </span></p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457925" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-5-copy.jpg" alt="" width="961" height="1280" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-5-copy.jpg 961w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-5-copy-367x489.jpg 367w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MTB-resize-5-copy-768x1023.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 961px) 100vw, 961px" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s exactly what happened with Justin and Sharn. Last year they went to Cannock Chase trail park together, where Justin was able to offer Sharn guidance. It’s this level of practical support he wants to keep offering to mountain bikers of colour. “I want to do my coaching training and impart whatever knowledge I&#8217;ve got,” he says “I want to bring kids of colour to Farmer John’s Bike Park [in Manchester] and show them what mountain biking is all about. If you want to take a group of kids from Manchester out, and you take them to the Lake District, when they get back, ‘They’ll say, that was great but it’s out of my reach, I can’t go back, I can’t afford it.’ But there’s stuff that&#8217;s within seven miles of Manchester City. If they’re close to home and being coached by someone who looks like them, they may go back and tell all their mates to have a go because it’s brilliant.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Almost as soon as Sharn started mountain biking, she started documenting her progress on social media, as well as creating a YouTube channel, Ride With Sharn. It’s full of nerve-racking Go-Pro footage as she navigates narrow woodland trails and unsuspecting pedestrians who have wandered into her path, but it’s also a platform for her to document her experiences as a woman of colour in mountain biking.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“If you’re not going to show me, I’ll show myself,” she says. “I’ve had so many messages from people telling me I’m the first Black mountain biker they’ve ever seen. I really take that to heart. It’s not just about me, it’s an honour to do this for other people.” Sharn hopes that by documenting her experiences, a new generation of mountain bikers from minority backgrounds will realise they have a right to take up a sport that is too often seen as a white, middle-class pursuit, despite the deafening lack of diversity in a lot of advertising. “People have this stereotype of minorities living in poverty but that’s not always the case. I wouldn’t say I&#8217;m the richest person but I&#8217;ve managed to do it; I hope I can be a positive role model in MTB.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Justin also hopes to inspire more people to take up the sport and is doing so with his work alongside the recently formed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mtb_colour_collective/?hl=en">Colour Collective</a>, a MTB specific group focused on celebrating and increasing the participation of people from diverse ethnic backgrounds. He has hundreds of reasons why newcomers should try it, particularly those the industry has ignored, but top of the list is the sense of fun, freedom and joy that a bike has given him. “Take your brain back in time to when you were 10 years old,” he says. “It’s the summer holidays. Your mates knock on the door and they’re all on their bikes, you get yours out and you disappear all day, with nothing but a Mars Bar in your pocket. Those were the best days ever. You were free, it felt like you were out for weeks on end on one Mars Bar. Mountain biking puts you back in that state of mind. It&#8217;s like being a kid again, and that’s a very hard feeling to get when you’re an adult.”</span></p>

adidas Terrex are working with the Colour Collective to host an event in Sheffield, UK (Spring 22). This will be one of the first mountain bike meet-ups specifically for people of colour in the UK and will go a long way in driving and owning the narrative.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[A new book brings together photos by Tom Wood taken over a period of over nearly 50 years, centring the photographer’s often-fraught lifelong relationship with Ireland.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Documentary photographer Tom Wood is best known for his images capturing everyday moments in Merseyside, from its bustling markets to crowded nightclubs. But when it comes to the photographer’s own heritage, “There’s an awful lot more to the story than just Liverpool,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wood’s latest photo book, <a href="https://www.rrbphotobooks.com/products/tom-wood-irish-work#:~:text=Irish%20Work%20by%20Tom%20Wood,wider%20history%20of%20the%20country."><em>Irish Work</em> (RRB)</a>, brings together some of the photographer’s previously unseen images of Ireland, covering 50 years of his own life and his ongoing relationship with County Mayo – the place of his birth. It’s also where he and his parents (one Catholic, one Protestant) were forced to leave from due to Sectarianism and religious norms. It’s clearly a fraught family history, but Wood doesn’t seem to harbour any ill feelings.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_457903" style="width: 918px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-457903" class="wp-image-457903 size-full" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Passing-Show-1996-.jpg" alt="" width="908" height="600" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Passing-Show-1996-.jpg 908w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Passing-Show-1996--740x489.jpg 740w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Passing-Show-1996--768x507.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Passing-Show-1996--402x267.jpg 402w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Passing-Show-1996--313x207.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" /><p id="caption-attachment-457903" class="wp-caption-text">The Passing Show, 1996</p></div>
<div id="attachment_457897" style="width: 910px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-457897" class="wp-image-457897 size-full" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intelligence-of-sheep-Portacloi-Bay-Ceathru%CC%81-Thaidhg.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intelligence-of-sheep-Portacloi-Bay-Ceathru%CC%81-Thaidhg.jpg 900w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intelligence-of-sheep-Portacloi-Bay-Ceathru%CC%81-Thaidhg-734x489.jpg 734w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intelligence-of-sheep-Portacloi-Bay-Ceathru%CC%81-Thaidhg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Intelligence-of-sheep-Portacloi-Bay-Ceathru%CC%81-Thaidhg-402x267.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /><p id="caption-attachment-457897" class="wp-caption-text">Intelligence of sheep, Portacloi Bay, Ceathrú Thaidhg, 2017</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, it’s quite the opposite: the book</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">is crammed with moments of joy, cherry-picked from Wood’s many years of documenting the area, from the rosy-cheeked children grinning out from leatherette car seats, to a jumble shop bursting with garments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, there are the disarming landscapes, which imbue a sense of grandiosity to the tough and repetitive lives of those who tend to the land as agricultural labourers. A hilltop sheep, somehow made majestic, surveys it’s kingdom in one image, while a woman braves the elements – defiant in her red anorak – in another. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visiting the area each year on holiday, County Mayo represents an ancestral home to Wood, a place of kinship and longing in equal measure. Referencing the Paul Durcan poem “Going Home to Mayo, Winter, 1949”, Wood recalls the ritual of taking the steam train to the Irish region and his father’s excitement throughout the journey. “Every year, my dad would walk up and down the train [to County Mayo] looking for the most interesting person to sit opposite and engage in conversation with. If they ignored him, he would go and talk to someone else. He was just so excited to be going home,” Wood recalls. “He clearly transmitted that [excitement] to me. It stays the same even now, after 50 years.”</span></p>

<div id="attachment_457893" style="width: 918px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-457893" class="wp-image-457893 size-full" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-camera-1986-.jpg" alt="" width="908" height="600" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-camera-1986-.jpg 908w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-camera-1986--740x489.jpg 740w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-camera-1986--768x507.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-camera-1986--402x267.jpg 402w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A-camera-1986--313x207.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px" /><p id="caption-attachment-457893" class="wp-caption-text">Annual Migration, 1996</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Describing </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irish Work</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as “personal, about family”, Wood recalls days spent speaking to and recording (some images within the books are film stills) the locals in the tight-knit agricultural community. It was a way for him to learn more about his own history. “I’d meet a farmer up on the hillside and we’d be underneath a mountain and he’d tell me things about my grandfather,” Wood remembers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While anecdotes like these are full of joy, there’s also a lingering melancholy – a nostalgia for a lifestyle which is all but disappearing. The elders who Wood recalls from his earliest memories are no longer with us. They take with them traditions around the land which will not necessarily be passed on due to mass migration as young people move out of Ireland in search of new opportunities and a different way of life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“When I began [documenting the area], that old Ireland, my dad’s generation was still there,” Wood explains. “They knew the old days and ways – they were like a different breed, where everything was physical and they were deeply rural.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With such a clear emotional attachment to the contents of this book, Wood explains that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irish Work</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> set out to “make a different kind of book”. The result is a collection of photos which make tangible Wood’s exploration of a once-removed Irish identity, and one which places the area’s inhabitants, in all their wonder, into full view. </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[In the fight against bad bosses, workers are adopting the platform tactics used against them and adapting them for their own benefit.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay rates for Deliveroo drivers in Edinburgh have gone up recently, but workers don’t know why. The variables determining how much they get paid are contained by an algorithmic ‘black box’, which no-one outside the company has access to. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Workers are left in the dark about why their incomes rise and fall – an unpredictability which causes stress and insecurity, says Deliveroo rider Lena (who asked for her surname to be withheld to protect her anonymity)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“At the end of the week you’re anxious, because you don’t know how much money you will earn,” she tells <em>Huck</em>. “Rates are changing every day. We don’t know enough about why rates change.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although impossible to confirm, Deliveroo workers think the rate rises are </span><a href="https://www.centreforcities.org/data/uk-unemployment-tracker/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">partly due to a shortage of riders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One reason for upward pressure on wages at a national level is a lack of available labour: a million fewer people are in the labour market now compared to pre-pandemic. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Employers are having to boost wages to attract and keep staff and some furloughed workers, given the choice, are not returning to low-paid or poor-quality work in sectors <a href="https://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Article/2021/10/14/Restaurants-boost-wages-amid-staffing-struggles-Lightspeed-Global-State-of-the-Hospitality-Industry-Report">such as hospitality</a>. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But relying solely on the market to boost incomes is risky, as riders could just as easily see their earnings fall again if more people join the platform, says Roz Foyer, general secretary of the Scottish </span><a href="https://www.tuc.org.uk/tuc-scotland"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TUC.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If riders knew more about how their rates were determined, they might be able to achieve permanent increases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s reasonable to assume some of the data feeding the algorithm is generated by riders themselves. As Deliveroo’s </span><a href="https://riders.deliveroo.co.uk/en/support/new-riders/how-do-i-get-paid"><span style="font-weight: 400;">website states</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the fee changes for each order delivered, and includes a variable amount based on the distance travelled. But with this data locked in the platform’s black box, riders are powerless to challenge the status quo. (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deliveroo did not respond for comment when asked what causes drivers’ pay rates to fluctuate.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyond causing financial instability, it means that gig workers who want to see the algorithms that dictate how they work and how much they get paid </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">can’t organise collectively to campaign for better terms and conditions. As </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foyer puts it: “With the development of the gig economy, power and control has [been] more concentrated on the employer side, and increasingly difficult for workers to understand.” For rider Lena, asking Deliveroo why their rates change is fraught: “I want to get information, but I don’t want to push because I’m scared [of getting fired].”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to this data-driven power imbalance, platform workers, unions and academics are fighting back. Dr Christina Colclough, founder of the </span><a href="https://www.thewhynotlab.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Not Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, sums up the challenge: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">How do we, without increasing the surveillance of workers, give them control?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p>One approach gaining momentum is to adopt platform tools and techniques and adapt them for workers’ benefit.<span style="font-weight: 400;"> “Companies have an attitude of ‘We can watch you and not tell you’&#8230; Now workers are wanting to say, ‘We can watch you too’,” says Cailean Gallagher, coordinator of the </span><a href="https://workersobservatory.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edinburgh Workers’ Observatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Observatory was started by Edinburgh gig workers, including Lena and former rider Boyan (who asked for his surname to be withheld to protect his privacy), to monitor their working conditions, using a model of ‘reverse surveillance’. When they realised the information they needed to understand their pay was hidden from them, they started to work together to monitor the local gig economy in the hope of seeing behind the secrecy of the platforms. They are developing an app which allows delivery workers to record their hours and payslips, then collates users’ data to calculate average pay rates across the city. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ultimately, they hope to use this data to achieve better pay in the long term by, for example, sharing their insights with trade unions and collaborating on campaigns and bargaining. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Initiatives with similar goals are springing up across the world. Common to most is worker ownership of the data they produce. It means that in disputes between workers and platforms, a worker-owned tool could provide verifiable data to challenge the platform. By working together and pooling their data, workers gain strength in numbers and mitigate the risk of simply being <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/perspectives/inside-the-fight-against-ubers-racist-facial-recognition-tech/">kicked off the platform</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among these emerging platforms is </span><a href="https://driversseat.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Driver’s Seat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an app in the US that allows drivers for Uber, Lyft and other similar apps, to see when and where they can earn the most. Data like this would normally only be available to the commercial platforms, but because Driver’s Seat is driver-owned and transparent about how data is used, it’s putting power back in workers’ hands. There’s also </span><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ubercheats/pkdblheaeakedkbkfhoeepgmfiajjdgn"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uber Cheats,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> built by a part-time Uber Eats driver and computer scientist in the US to help his fellow delivery workers track deliveries and pay. He found over 20 per cent of trips he analysed were under-paid, as the Uber Eats app was </span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/08/20/programmers-say-uber-eats-is-systematically-underpaying-their-workers/%20."><span style="font-weight: 400;">under-recording how far workers travelled</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Thanks to this data, he managed to get Uber to pay him properly for his own trips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr Colclough, when serving as director at UNI Global Union, worked with partners at Guardian Project, MIT Media Lab and Cambridge University to develop </span><a href="https://weclock.it/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeClock.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The app allows workers to track a wide range of data produced while they work, such as a record of time spent in the workplace, whether proper breaks are taken, and time between shifts. The data might show that workers are putting in more hours than they are paid for or not given the breaks they are entitled to, helping them to gather evidence and build a case for change or compensation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These new tools are not just the preserve of well-funded startups. In many cases, they are built by gig workers themselves, using their existing coding or copywriting skills. Boyan, for example, uses data skills gained from his new job in tech and his degree. It’s early days for many of these initiatives, with teams only just getting to grips with what is technically and legally possible, and the best tools to achieve their goals. </span></p>
<p>On top of fighting for better working conditions in the short-term, this idea of workers taking control of their data could feed into bigger conversations. This includes the future of platform ownership, and whether worker-owned platforms could one day become the norm.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Roz Foyer, it is critical that unions embrace these new tactics and help to build digital tools that provide new ways of empowering workers. But Dr Colclough sounds an important note of caution, emphasising the need to avoid replicating the problematic aspects of the platforms workers want to challenge: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have to be very, very careful that we don’t jump into this new technology without thinking about protecting the privacy of members,” she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cailean Gallagher from the Workers’ Observatory sees benefits from this first wave of initiatives spreading into sectors that are rapidly becoming datafied – including care, construction and retail. He is also hopeful for deeper impacts, reshaping how we think about and organise working time and pay in future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he puts it: “In time, workers will find ways to harness their power against corporations and to turn their tools against them.” </span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Discrimination and marginalisation of trans people is exacerbating the risks they face when it comes HIV/AIDS.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite being left out of the wider HIV/AIDS narrative, the trans community and those living with the condition have long overlapped. Lou Sullivan, a US author and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the first known gay trans man </span>diagnosed<span style="font-weight: 400;"> with </span>AIDS in 1987<span style="font-weight: 400;">, spent many years campaigning for psychiatric and trans health organisations to recognise the existence of gay trans men. In the 1990s, Connie Norman, a trans woman living with HIV, served as a prominent member of Act Up in Los Angeles, and fought tirelessly for the world to pay attention to the AIDS crisis. Indeed, countless trans people living with the condition have followed in their footsteps as HIV/AIDS activists. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The past few decades have seen huge steps forward in the fight against HIV: <a href="https://www.tht.org.uk/hiv-and-sexual-health/about-hiv/hiv-statistics">an incredible 94 per cent</a> of people living with HIV in the UK are diagnosed, with 98 per cent of these on treatment and 97 per cent having an undetectable viral load, meaning they cannot pass on HIV. But with trans people still excluded from the conversation, they are left woefully underserved by messaging on prevention, diagnosis and treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">General ignorance and wilful bigotry in the shape of transphobia has led to a dearth of research when it comes to the impact of HIV/AIDS on the trans community . What small amount of data there is, based on the 2014 UNAIDS Gap </span><a href="https://files.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2014/UNAIDS_Gap_report_en.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, is riddled with flaws and gaps. Most ‘global’ studies skew towards the US, meaning it’s hard to extract specifics about the experiences of trans people dealing with HIV in the UK. There are also issues around the way that data on gender is collected, with the broad and amorphous category of ‘trans’ being inconsistently defined from study to study. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data often refers only to trans women, and even this can be shaky, as in some studies, trans women have been misgendered and misclassified as gay or bisexual men. The UNAIDS report outright states that, as of 2014, “The impact of HIV on transgender men [had] yet to be established”. Information on HIV among non-binary people is even harder to come by.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the data gap, the National Aids Trust </span><a href="https://www.nat.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/NAT%20Trans%20Evidence%20Review%20V3%20Digital.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">stated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Beyond not having accurate prevalence statistics for the UK, these data uncertainties effectively lead to the erasure of trans* people from debates around HIV and healthcare more broadly, and make it difficult to assess the range of services required to address HIV-related need among the trans* population in the UK.”</span></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These gaps are beginning to be redressed – at least in some regions. Since 2017, Public Health England (PHE) has published data on trans people accessing HIV care in England, as well as those newly diagnosed. In April 2019, Peter Kirwan of PHE and Michelle Ross of <a href="https://cliniq.org.uk/">CliniQ</a> – the “holistic sexual health, mental health and wellbeing service” for trans, non-binary and gender diverse people – presented data drawn from the 2017 results of PHE’s updated HIV and AIDS Reporting System and self-reported data from a survey conducted by </span><a href="https://www.tht.org.uk/our-work/community-projects/positive-voices?gclid=Cj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0XavqFzXOIN1hD9lRYXiNhMNz8a1PyTtVwC1GZZFt3-VEI8WdqxaTIaAv2pEALw_wcB"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Positive Voices</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. While they found no observed difference between the standard of HIV-specific care accessed by cis or trans people, trans people living with HIV reported worse mental health and more discrimination than their cis counterparts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inclusive, reliable local research is vital to improving the provision of HIV-related care for trans people in the UK, allowing services to be tailored to the community and their actual needs, rather than perceived ones based on broad global statistics.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rory Finn, who works on sexual health promotion with the </span><a href="http://www.tht.org.uk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrence Higgins Trust</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, points out that statistics like the </span><a href="https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations/transgender"><span style="font-weight: 400;">oft-cited</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “trans women are 49 times more likely to acquire HIV than other adults” are misleading. While true across the world, the stat does not reflect the reality within the UK. Finn maintains that if we overstate the risks of trans women as a whole, “we underestimate the risks of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">certain</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trans people”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finn continues: “I identify as queer and gay, and I have sex with cis men, and time and time again, I find health information telling me that I shouldn&#8217;t be taking PrEP, because I’m not at risk of HIV. I find that really frustrating, because I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">know</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I’m at risk of HIV [as a trans man] [&#8230;] I know of a few trans men who have become positive, when there were health interventions that could have been put in place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But these issues go deeper than just a lack of reliable data-sets and strong messaging. An ongoing climate of transphobia has exacerbated the problem, making trans people reluctant to access services not specifically geared towards them for fear of stigmatisation or rejection. These fears are not unfounded: 70 per cent of respondents to a </span><a href="https://www.transactual.org.uk/trans-lives-21"><span style="font-weight: 400;">recent survey by Trans Actual </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">reported experiencing transphobia in a healthcare setting, and 14 per cent had been refused GP care on at least one occasion because they were trans. Almost half felt that their GP did not have a good understanding of their needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For trans people living with HIV, life at the intersection of two marginalised groups lays bare the shortcomings of a social environment not necessarily equipped to support either. The dual marginalisation often means that patients are passed from pillar to post, with some reporting that practitioners are eager to refer them back to gender identity or HIV-specific services, even for routine complaints. In these cases, GPs might attempt to pass a patient on to a gender identity clinic, only for the clinic to pass them back when it becomes apparent their needs fall outside their remit, ultimately making treatment more difficult to access. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“For me, it used to be [that GPs would] palm things off back to the gender clinic,” says Niamh Millar, a Living Well Specialist with the Terrence Higgins Trust, who is HIV positive. “Now it’s: ‘Is this anything to do with your [HIV positive] status?’ [Even though] you know when you go to the GP that it has nothing to do with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rory Finn believes these kinds of interactions put people off accessing health services, which in turn, could affect sexual health outcomes. “The broad brush of this is that trans people – regardless of their status – are facing health inequalities when accessing any healthcare, but in particular, NHS healthcare,” he says. “While I think sexual health and HIV medicine is much more enlightened, it doesn’t take away the experiences trans people have in other parts of healthcare, and those bad experiences will affect access to HIV and sexual health care.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Millar agrees. Speaking about accessing support just over a decade ago, she recalls her concern about whether she would be accepted in a women’s group after telling them she had HIV. “Rather than the first concern being ‘I want to get help’, it’s ‘Will I be accepted when I make that step to get help?’” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often spearheaded by trans people themselves, there are charities and organisations attempting to plug the gaps in trans health provision with initiatives providing non-stigmatising, informed services for transgender patients. These organisations are primarily clustered in cities like London or Brighton. “We’re lucky in Brighton and Hove because we’ve got really good local provision,” says Finn. “That’s born out of the fact that we’re in a city that has a really large LGBTQ+ population, a large trans population […] That&#8217;s not being seen in the rest of the country.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An expansion of these kinds of services, with trans people on-board at all levels, would make an enormous difference to sexual health outcomes and HIV care within the community. Many of those working in the field are clear on what is needed to allow all trans people living with HIV to live well, and to improve sexual health outcomes in general among the community. It is what Finn refers to as “cultural competence” – the understanding of the specific issues and experiences relevant to trans people, as well as a baseline of knowledge about trans health needs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trans people need improved access to healthcare in general, which in turn, will increase their confidence in accessing sexual health services. They need to know that when they seek support it will be provided to them, and that healthcare practitioners will be knowledgeable about their needs and not stigmatise them. This need is even more acutely felt for trans people living with HIV. If the UK government is serious about ending new diagnosis of HIV by 2030, then health services must be fit for purpose – for everyone who needs them.</span></p>

Spanning five decades, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spike</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers a film-by-film look behind the scenes, replete with film stills, on-set photographs, personal images and insights from Spike Lee. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Spike’s younger brother, official on-set photographer, and lifelong collaborator, David Lee has played an integral role in the family business — one that took root in Brooklyn. I</span>n the late 1960s, the Lee family moved to Fort Greene and bought a brownstone on the park. “There was so much creativity in the house. Our dad is a musician: he taught me piano, Spike played violin, and my sister Joie played bass. My mom was an educator so we knew about the Harlem Renaissance.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lee remembers admiring the work of his brother Chris, a trailblazing graffiti writer who went by the pseudonym SHADOW. Though Lee couldn’t draw, he discovered a way to visually express himself through photography — and, as fate would have it, such a skill would serve the burgeoning family business well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spike was always the general,” Lee remembers. “Whether shooting something for his films or wanting me to be the catcher on the baseball team, he was always organising.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With his distinctive mix of history, drama, satire, and style, Spike Lee has transformed the landscape of filmmaking to broaden the way Black stories are seen and told. David Lee’s poignant and evocative photographs made on the set of films including </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do the Right Thing, Malcolm X, Crooklyn, 4 Little Girls,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summer of Sam</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offer a glimpse inside the iconoclastic mind of the auteur. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spike is not just incredibly visual, but he has always had a sense of how to promote something,” Lee says. “When we were working on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mo’ Better Blues</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, he had this concept inspired by [jazz photographer] William Claxton. It was a little sub current to the movie. When I got a chance to shoot the actors, I made it stylised but still related to my portraiture so that our sensibilities were in step.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spike in turn hired Claxton to shoot </span><a href="http://digitaljournalist.org/issue0103/wc17.htm"><span style="font-weight: 400;">colour advertising work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the film. “Spike has good sense of what’s effective,” says Lee. “There’s this wealth of imagery — it’s almost like having historical references coursing through your blood, and he might not even be completely aware of it, but it’s registering on some level.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Having worked side by side over the past five decades, Lee’s photographs reveal an intuitive ability to complement his brother’s kaleidoscopic approach to filmmaking that always pushes the boundaries, both aesthetically and conceptually. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Spike allows me the space to make my own contribution and create a moment that is not a scene from the movie but conveys [the spirit] of it. I get a chance to do my own improvisation,” says Lee, a lifetime member of the band.</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[The pandemic has led to a dramatic increase in illegal evictions, leaving tenants in desperate situations. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 4 November this year, Beata, age 33, was evicted from her home in Walsall. Her landlord told her she had 20 minutes to pack up her most important belongings and leave, with a day to come back and get the rest of her things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beata is on the brink of tears as we talk over the phone. It’s been less than two weeks since she lost her home. She can’t sleep. She can’t even tell her five-year-old daughter, Agata, what’s happening. “She just asks me every single day, ‘When can I go back to my room? Where’s my home gone?’&#8221;. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For months, the landlord had been ignoring almost all of Beata’s requests. This included fixing a broken radiator; stopping water coming through the roof; and sorting out the mould coming from the floor, which was giving Agata an allergic reaction. “She [the landlord] never answered. She did nothing,” Beata says. If there was ever a response, it’d be the landlord replying to say if Beata had any problems, she ought to move out. “I lived there for four years and I didn’t see her. She never sent anybody to fix anything.” In October, Beata sent a message asking if she could have a short delay in when she paid her rent – again, the landlord didn’t answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After telling the landlord that she had complained about the conditions in the house to the council, she was then almost immediately served with an eviction notice. To evict a tenant without filing notice in advance is illegal. Beata wasn’t able to collect her £1000 deposit and the next night, she was told by a neighbour that the landlord was in the flat taking away her remaining possessions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beata could only watch as they left with her belongings: a fridge, a washing machine, her daughter’s bed. A whole life swiftly rolled away. Her landlord told her these items was confiscated because she still owed them money, but even now, after paying back everything they’ve demanded, her former landlord still has her mirrors, curtains and more and are refusing to return them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illegal evictions, already a worsening problem before the pandemic, skyrocketed after coronavirus hit the UK. It’s down to a combination of factors: for starters, a ban on legal evictions that was introduced in March 2020 and fully ended in June of this year, which has seen many landlords choose the illicit alternative; the rising unemployment and economic insecurity from the pandemic; and a lack of repercussions for illegal behaviour from landlords. Data from this time last year found that the rate of illegal evictions was </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/business/illegal-eviction-coronavirus-pandemic-housing-tenants-b487020.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">50 per cent higher than before Covid-19</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Even this figure is likely to be a massive underestimate: many people who get illegally evicted may not report it, or even know what happened to them was illegal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite Beata’s eviction being illegal, the police’s handling of the case was woefully inadequate. When Beata called them as her belongings were being taken away, they told her it was a civil matter – something the police don’t get involved in. That was untrue; while the police don’t prosecute illegal evictions they are legally bound to intervene in favour of the tenant to keep them in their home. “By not reacting, the police consented to such behaviour,” says Beata. “They showed me that you cannot rely on them and that there is no justice.”</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Two years since the government pledged to end Section 21 evictions. Not only have they failed to institute the legislation, but enabled landlords to conduct illegal evictions in the middle of a public health crises, eschewing any accountability and risking renters livelihoods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just two </span><a href="https://www.generationrent.org/evictions_are_hard_to_stop_even_when_they_re_illegal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per cent of recorded illegal evictions</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> led to any kind of prosecution against the landlord. “The police just don&#8217;t have any understanding of housing law at all,” says John-Luke Bolton, an illegal eviction caseworker for housing charity Safer Renting. “They often just side with the landlord because they’re the property owner. That’s another huge issue.” It’s a recurring theme across John-Luke’s casework and everyone </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Huck</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spoke to for this piece. John-Luke tells me there are instances of police arriving and actively aiding the landlord to evict someone illegally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, illegal evictions are just the final blow in an already painful journey.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The problems started almost immediately after moving in for Andrea, whose name has been changed to protect her anonymity. Just a month after an agency offered her and her two children into a flat in East London the heating broke. The landlord said they couldn’t afford to fix it. Then a plug exploded, starting a small fire. Andrea moved to her mother’s home to protect the children from more explosions, and the landlord kept promising to fix the problem but didn’t deliver. Another plug exploded, still nothing was fixed. It took outside intervention from a housing licensing officer (council officers who monitor the quality of rented accommodation) to get anything resolved. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over months, the problems kept occurring – and then on 26 July 2021, water flooded the entire flat up to their knees. “The landlord told us you can&#8217;t stay there, you just need to leave and then we will see what we will do,” she explains. Her landlord said to ask the council for help. Andrea obliged, but when she left to stay with her mother, unbeknownst to her, the landlord was trying to have her evicted. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The landlord told the council that I’d left the house, but I was telling [the council] my possessions were still there and I’d only left because the landlord told me to leave,” she tells <em>Huck</em>. “We were without any clothes. We didn&#8217;t have enough money or half of my documents, my car, everything was gone.” Thanks to interventions from lawyers and activists in the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safer Renting</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> team, she has secured accommodation, but is still fighting her landlord who is refusing to return her deposit, and has repeatedly threatened her, saying she stole from them in the months since the illegal eviction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with so many of the issues that have exploded during the pandemic, its roots can be traced back to years before. In the decade after the Conservatives first took power and enacted brutal rounds of austerity, council spending on </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/29/council-spending-on-local-services-down"><span style="font-weight: 400;">local services has sunk by 21</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per cent. And one of the many services that weren’t ring-fenced in most council council budgets were the kind of tenancy or housing officers that investigate and prosecute criminal landlords and fight illegal evictions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That whole aspect of enforcing landlord tenant law pretty much just got forgotten about,” John-Luke explains. What might be the most tragic thing about illegal evictions is that they’re just the tip of a scarily large iceberg. According to Shelter, </span><a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/media/press_release/45_of_private_renters_have_been_victims_of_illegal_acts_by_their_landlord_or_letting_agent_"><span style="font-weight: 400;">45 per cent of England’s private renters</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – roughly equivalent to 3.7 million people – have been the victim of some form of illegal behaviour from a landlord or letting agent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s emblematic of the complete power imbalance between tenants and landlords. “The way they act, it’s like they’re saying: ‘I’m the landlord, I can do whatever I want’,” explains Andrea.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“They were just there telling me I had to leave, and what am I going to do?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And these stories are playing out across the country. John-Luke shares with me the countless cases of illegal evictions he’s been working on recently. In one case, a mother was illegally evicted and left homeless when she complained to a landlord about the impact the flat was having on her son’s health. In another, a man was beaten up by a landlord, who then proceeded to illegally evict him and threw away all his possessions. With his passport and all other forms of IDs now gone, he was unable to claim for benefits or get assistance from the council for homeless accommodation. He was left on the street.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Left abandoned in a bureaucratic nightmare, unsupported by councils or the police, for Beata, the future is now uncertain. She is temporarily staying at a friend’s home with her daughter, but will be forced to find an alternative soon. All the council has offered is a £45 per night hostel, something that would end up costing her £1300 a month – almost three times as much as she was spending at her original home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People are being left in a difficult, sometimes incomprehensible situation, without help,” she says. “And they can only count on themselves.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Founded in 2015, Obsidia is the world’s only portable, feminist nation, and its creation is offering a means to explore alternative modes of political organisation. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On every 4th of July, when millions of Americans gather at barbecues to celebrate their national holiday and proudly display the American flag on every available surface, the citizens of Obsidia – an enclave in Oakland, California – celebrate “Destroy Nationalism Day”. Dressed in their nation’s official colours, electric blue and hot pink, they burn their own flag. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obsidia is a ‘micronation’ – a self-declared territorial entity that has not been recognised by other states or international organisations. They differ from microstates, like Monaco or Andorra, which are recognised sovereign entities, and are distinct from secessionist movements that actively seek to challenge the sovereignty of nation states. It is believed the first recorded micronation was established in 1925, when Martin Harman declared himself king of the British island of Lundy, off the coast of Devon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often admittedly nonsensical or satirical projects, micronations vary in size, from the 620,000 square miles of land that make up </span><a href="https://www.westarctica.info/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Westarctica</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – founded in 2001 by Travis McHenry when he realised that a huge chunk of Antarctica had not been claimed by any recognised state – to the two small slabs of Obsidian rock roughly the size of a book, from which Obsidia gets its name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The so-called “world’s only mobile feminist nation”, with an all women and queer government, Obsidia is nestled in an electric blue and hot pink briefcase. The briefcase is usually headquartered in Oakland but can be carried everywhere. “Due to size limitations and fragility, humans can not physically enter the landmass,” </span><a href="http://www.obsidiagov.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obsidia’s website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> warns. </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457793" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0604.jpg" alt="" width="851" height="815" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0604.jpg 851w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0604-511x489.jpg 511w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0604-768x736.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not having a physical territory, Obsidia has many of the traditional attributes of a country: a national anthem (“<em>Our citizens are super hot/ We are an anti-state/ In a briefcase!</em>”), official state animals (snails and swans), national sports (sailing and croquet), and a navy (two sailboats and one dinghy). “One thing we have not come to a consensus on yet is the national currency. As of now we accept bartering, fruit, and American dollars,” says Grand Marshal Karo Yagjian, Obsidia’s founder. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karo estimates that there are currently around 250 Obsidian citizens, 50 of which have a passport, which is not mandatory for citizenship and works more as a conversation starter than an official document. Aspiring citizens have to face Obsidia’s flag and do the official salute – right arm extended to the side with an open hand, palm facing forward – while reciting the following oath: “Obsidia, I pledge to honour thee. I will uphold the values of Obsidia until I die or become bored.” Citizenship will be granted to anyone, but cis-gendered men cannot serve in government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The website lists eight government officials, whose titles reflect their interests and skill sets. While a few roles were crafted and allocated by Karo, some officials have come up with their own position. Karo’s sister Christina, who is passionate about environmental issues, is Head of Ecology. Alecia Ott, who has sailing experience, is the Captain of the Obsidian Navy. Other roles are slightly more fanciful, like the very specific remit that the Mistress of Propaganda and Animal Welfare, Georgia Rae, chose for herself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Citizens are mainly from the US, but Obsidia does have satellite embassies in both Hong-Kong and Germany. While the pandemic prevented Obsidian citizens from getting together in person, Karo is hoping to put together a small event for ‘Swansmas’ – Obsidia’s version of Christmas celebrated on 27th December, which honours the First Lady/Minister of Culture’s love of swans. She’s also planning a </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWluBvkvBvD/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">winter card mail exchange,</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a sort of nationwide Secret Santa to connect with fellow citizens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Karo, Obsidia is an objectively fun and lighthearted artistic venture, but not a meaningless one. “I don’t believe that artists should be apolitical,” she says. “Too much is at stake and if I am going to devote time and attention to something, it needs to feel meaningful.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Started in 2015, the micronation stems from an ambition to explore alternative modes of political organisation. As a teenager, Karo discovered Neue Slowenische Kunst (NSK) – a Slovenian political art collective which has claimed to be a sovereign state since 1991, maintaining consulates in other countries and issuing passports and stamps. This idea of a stateless, borderless state that encompasses the whole world fascinated Karo. “This story in particular really woke me up to the temporal nature of state authority and made me want to start my own project, which didn’t happen until years later,” she says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, Karo heard about </span><a href="https://www.microcon2021.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MicroCon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a biennial summit of micronationalist governments created by the Republic of Molossia, a tongue-in-cheek project in Nevada whose founder calls taxes to local government “foreign aid”. The inaugural event was due to take place in Anaheim, California, and Karo knew she didn&#8217;t want to attend as a spectator. “This guy I was sleeping with at the time had a big pile of Obsidian. I took a chunk of it and proclaimed independence and history was made,” she recalls. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the beginning, Karo wanted Obsidia to have a political core, and to be a conduit for her own political journey. “When I founded the nation I was dealing with my own personal awakening to feminism. This arose from a really bad time in my life, being mistreated and witnessing those close to me suffer from domestic and sexual violence,” she says. For Karo, the playfulness at the heart of the project is a political act in itself, a way for women and LGBTQ+ people to find community in the alienating and disempowering environment that capitalism creates. “For Obsidians, the oppression of women and capitalism are inextricable. We believe creativity is the most important tool for resistance against and survival under capitalism,” she explains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both Karo and Alecia are involved in political activism outside of, or rather parallel to, Obsidia. Alecia sails with </span><a href="https://www.womenonwaves.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Women on Waves</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an organisation which provides contraceptives, sex education, and safe abortion services outside territorial waters for women in countries where abortion is illegal. Karo works for a refugee association called </span><a href="http://www.laddersaves.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ladder Outreach and Rescue Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and fundraises for organisations in Armenia, where communities are still recovering from the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war. “This work can be really heavy, so at least with Obsidia we have a fun organisation that’s tangentially related in its mission,” Karo says.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457794" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0689.jpg" alt="" width="1620" height="1080" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0689.jpg 1620w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0689-734x489.jpg 734w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0689-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0689-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/DSC_0689-402x267.jpg 402w" sizes="(max-width: 1620px) 100vw, 1620px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Philip Hayward, adjunct research professor at the University of Technology Sydney and micronations expert, Obsidia belongs to the strand of micronations that have a political vision. Other examples include </span><a href="http://www.atlantium.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Atlantium</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a non-territorial global state and social movement which aims to show the arbitrary nature of borders; </span><a href="https://liberland.org/en/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liberland</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a libertarian micronation established on a disputed plot of land on the western bank of the Danube between Croatia and Serbia; and The Gay and Lesbian Kingdom of the Coral Sea Islands, a group of uninhabited islets off the coast of Australia that were declared independent in 2004 by gay rights activists as part of a political campaign to legalise gay marriage in Australia. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three other strands of micronations, according to Hayward, are: vanity projects often started by men who wish to fulfil dreams of uncontested leadership; independent republics declared for the sole purpose of circumventing regulation, such as the inability to obtain planning permission; and short-lived internet-based projects where people claim random areas they have no connection to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Hayward, political micronations are in the minority, for the simple reason that their niche appeal means their political clout remains limited. But for Kundai Chirindo, an associate professor of Rhetoric and Media Studies at Lewis and Clark College in Portland who researches post-colonial micronations, political micronations are fascinating projects that reflect a genuine discontent with current political entities. “Helplessness is the driving force [behind political micronations],” he explains. “When a particular political arrangement doesn&#8217;t serve the interests of the community, people are resourceful, people adapt. They will contort and conform themselves otherwise, out of the anxieties driven by the dissatisfaction towards the existing political arena.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Chirindo, the rise of different ways of imagining political collectives is a welcome development. “People forget that the idea of the nation state as you and I know it today is actually a fairly recent development in the broader history of our species,” he says. “Coming out of the Treaty of Westphalia [the 1648 peace treaty which brought the Thirty Years&#8217; War to an end and defined the principles of national sovereignty] were these borders and boundaries that were superficially imposed, and separated people, cultures, and communities. The micronation […] is a protest against this superficiality.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This rejection of the very concept of the nation-state is also at the heart of Obsidia’s political stance, reflected in its lack of territory and borders. “Having rocks be our actual ‘nation’ is both nonsensical and really thought-provoking, in my opinion,” Alecia says. “It’s portable, allowing it to travel anywhere, and can be seen as a manifestation of our belief that borders are imaginary and only serve to uphold capitalistic and militaristic aims.” The burning of the flag on Destroy Nationalism Day, which Karo says is the most important Obsidian holiday, symbolises Obsidian citizens’ commitment to reevaluating their relationship to nationalist ideology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karo believes that by creating a community where people can imagine and talk about different ways of coming together, Obsidia can be a force for change. “I can say that through this project, I have most definitely prioritised my relationships with the women and queer people in my life and strengthened my own resolve,” she says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a popular anarchist saying that ‘Another world is possible’ and I think Obsidia really takes that to heart,” Alecia adds. “Obviously we aren’t taking over the world, but creating community, putting out new ideas, pushing for alternatives to the status quo, I think that is what we’re about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Micronations are fundamentally whimsical and unreplicable on a larger scale; they emerge from the imagination of creative individuals and the political power they wield will always be limited. But they shouldn’t be dismissed as silly or inconsequential projects. They can be spaces for effective community building and foster genuine conversations about alternatives modes of political organisation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We live in a male-dominated world and the assumption that progress for women and LGBTQ+ people is a linear path that will naturally unfold is not necessarily a given,” Karo says. “People still need to see this modeled, and satire is a really powerful artform.”</span></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Following the release of his latest album, the rapper talks about the influences that have shaped his sound so far and making music that connects with the average listener.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<article>
        <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mick Jenkins recently went on a hike with his wife and stumbled upon a private beach that looked like paradise. Beyond the tranquillity of this intimate moment, the 30-year-old rap artist says it represented a special kind of personal growth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t even think to take a video and post it on my social media,” he tells me during an early morning phone call. “I used to be super into doing that type of shit, but I don’t need to think like that anymore. All these moments are just for me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This level of contentment is reflected all across Jenkins’ latest album, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elephant in the Room</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where the artist sounds infectiously laid back and rational; someone desperate to impart wisdom and inspire others to find themselves beyond a </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0WiqWiYc9zKsJUlvqoJGC1?si=9E-rA61TQHC5vkVZcMElog"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reflection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a smartphone screen. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among its highlights, the scathing </span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/33Wlum73hbF1P7lbdIUmZ7?si=aH3NIhnuSGCqR9l8TWzUaA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Things You Could Die For If Doing While Black”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> points to the kind of everyday activities Black people can get murdered for doing in America – whether its jogging, sleeping in a car, calling the police for assistance, or even just smoking weed. The cinematic song points out a double standard and the fears that white people simply don’t have to contend with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The soothing ‘</span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1ZaR42Tox80OyzgOmxGJ4D?si=KiEJWCCbRCygE_iRz3UFtg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is, This Cigarettes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’ has the artist doubting the validity of information shared on the internet. He reminds the listener of his rough journey from the South Side of Chicago, rapping: “</span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">A ni*** born from pain</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> / r</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">emember when I would hit purp&#8217; up for that quarter thang</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> / w</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>e got that bullshit off my shoulders like a halter top.</em>” Tonally, this song feels like dipping your toes into the ocean and contemplating your life choices amid a neon sunset. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like every great Mick Jenkins’ project – of which there are many – </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elephant In The Room</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> reflects the artist’s quest to become a better man and be defined by more than just his trauma. But it is arguably looser and less earnest than some of these previous releases, proving the artist is more than capable of growth ten years into his career. “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elephant In The Room</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about looking at life’s big challenges and having confidence you can overcome them,” Jenkins agrees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I felt a real type of freedom [making this album]. That’s not to say I have been unhappy in the past, but I think people in general don’t realise how much peace in your home life will result in better art. So often, Black artists buy into this cliché that going through strife results in the best art. I am in a good place in my marriage and also mentally speaking. Subsequently, this is some of my best ever music! If I stay making $150k a year off my business, and perform three to four months of every year, then I’m more than happy with that reality.”</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Mick Jenkins - &quot;Carefree&quot; Black Boy (Official Music Video)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sK_BwprqgRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In truth, it&#8217;s hard to understand why Jenkins isn’t making millions. Since emerging with 2012’s self-aware </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Mickstape</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the artist has consistently pushed against the tide, with thoughtful freeflow verses that consider how gentrification has made the Black-owned stores on his block tumble down like </span><a href="https://youtu.be/HzTAfG91F8g"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jenga</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and even the need to purify yourself with water. “Wars will be fought over water in the future,” he assures me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On 2014’s gorgeous </span><a href="https://youtu.be/F-4KiszXxHM"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Jazz”</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, amid heavenly flourishes of a vibraphone, the emcee successfully tempted a new generation into understanding the lineage that aligns hip-hop with jazz musicians like John Coltrane, Charlie Parker, and Miles Davis. Besides being an astute rapper, the artist also has a natural ability to switch things up with cerebral R&amp;B melodies that sound like Maxwell if he read more Ralph Ellison. New song ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8adryOSkdE">Gucci Tried To Tell Me</a>’ is a great example of this. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet arguably, Jenkins’ refusal to play the social media game has delayed his mainstream impact. Not that he cares too much. “Sometimes I wonder if using <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/topics/tiktok/">TikTok</a> would give me a [career] boost, but then I remember how unhappy all that shit would make me feel,” he admits. “Winning Grammy’s and playing arenas would be nice [in the future], but personal growth is the most important thing. I don’t need to worry about people sleeping on my music cos’ the real rappers and rap fans know I am one of the best out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Huck</em> caught up with Jenkins to discuss the artists that inspired him growing up, what advice he’d give to his younger self and empowering his listeners. </span></p>
<p><b>What I love about you as a lyricist is you’ll share an extremely personal memory in the middle of a verse. It could be about sleeping on the floor as a kid, so your cousin could get the bed, or even missing your grandma’s death because you were too busy in the studio&#8230;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always try to make things relatable. Sometimes I hear emcees talking about having <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/topics/jean-michel-basquiat/">Basquiat</a> paintings on their walls, but a lot of the people listening are never going to be rich enough to own that shit. Rap has a lot of flossing and braggadocio, so I like the challenge of making everyday, mundane things, like drinking water or baking bread with your girlfriend, feel like something worth boasting about. I want to take a step back and try to make the average man feel empowered by what he already has.</span></p>
<p><b>I remember when you said “</b><b><i>Food is a whole ass drug / Ronald McDonald is a whole ass plug</i></b><b>” back on ‘</b><a href="https://youtu.be/u6x_JKH8ixM"><b>1000 Xans</b></a><b>’. It really got me thinking about how working-class areas are always in close proximity to cheap fast food joints. It feels a little like a plan, right? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ni***s try to explain and say it’s okay because it’s capitalism, but that song was showing how people are in a daze and not acknowledging what’s really going on. We got things called ‘food deserts’ in America, where whole poor communities with huge radiuses literally have no access to fresh food and everything is processed. It is to keep people back; it is to keep people stifled; and it is to keep people unhealthy. If you look at how all that shit funnels back towards boardrooms then it really is undeniable that it’s all part of some plan. </span></p>
<p><b>Who were the artists that inspired you growing up? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember being real small and in the back of a car rapping every line to a Biggie verse. My mom was like: “How the hell do you know the words to this?”. When I was a teenager, my older cousin handed me Little Brother’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Minstrel Show</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and I guess that’s what really changed things. Listening to them led to Black Star then to Common, to Lupe Fiasco and Kanye West. An emcee like Phonte [of Little Brother] was so instrumental in my development because he spoke about regular shit, yet still sounded just as fly as the rappers who spoke about their jewellery. </span></p>

<p><b>There’s a lot more singing on this project. Do you ever envision a day where you put out, say, a whole neo-soul album? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first song I ever recorded was me singing. I guess I listened back and thought it was trash, which led me on the path to be a rapper. Sometimes my voice can carry a song, sometimes my raps or the drums can, but nothing is catchier than a good melody. I think understanding that melody needs to be at the heart of the song composition has really helped me improve as an artist. Inevitably, my riffs and melodies are inspired by people like Sade, Jill Scott, and Maxwell.</span></p>
<p><b>I’m a big fan of serpentwithfeet, who lends his vocals to “Rug Burn” and “Scottie Pippen”. There’s something so honest about the way that he sings. Would you say he brought out more of a tenderness in your rapping? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Definitely. It gets buried sometimes, but he brought it all out. I wanted him to do background vocals on every single song; sadly, I only got him on like four. If you’re in the studio with him, it’s like he gives you license to be more vulnerable. </span></p>
<p><b>If you could speak to that kid who studied old Little Brother mixtapes, what would you tell him? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t sign a deal. It’s the biggest mistake I ever made. As Black artists, we need to learn about ownership and how to empower ourselves. </span></p>
<p><b>On the excellent ‘Care Free’ from the </b><b><i>Circus</i></b><b> EP, you spoke about Black people struggling to live without fear. Ultimately, what does freedom look like for Mick Jenkins? </b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always tell my wife that being free is about being a kid forever. When you are a kid, you are living purely for discovery. You learn every single day and that’s literally all you do. It’s definitely something to try to aim for. I guess I identify with the greats like Sade, Andre 3000, Mos Def, and Frank Ocean, because they participate as much as they want [musically] and then they go back home and live their lives. Andre 3000 can just wander the street </span><a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/andre-3000-flute/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">playing the flute</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, smiling. There’s no pressure. That’s freedom to me. </span></p>
