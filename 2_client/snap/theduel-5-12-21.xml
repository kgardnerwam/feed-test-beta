Javonte Williams - Rushing Yards: Over 74.5 (-110)</h2><p>The Broncos ruled Melvin Gordon out earlier in the week, leaving Denver without one of its two-headed monster at running back. But, that leaves an average of 12.3 rushing attempts and 55 rushing yards per game up for grabs. Denver will rely heavily on Williams in Week 13 and faces a Chiefs defense that allows 111.6 yards per game on the ground. </p><h2>2. Clyde Edwards-Helaire - Rushing Yards: Under 61.5 (-110)</h2><p>Clyde Edwards-Helaire returned in Week 11 after a five-week absence on the injured reserve. His absence saw emergence of Darrell Williams, who clearly carved out a role after gaining 48.8 rushing yards per contest. While the Denver Broncos defense rates just 26th in Football Outsiders&#39; rush-defense DVOA metric, they only allow 106.6 rushing yards per game. Keeping in mind that Kansas City throws the ball at the fourth-highest clip (63.3%) in the league and CEH managed just 12 rushing attempts in his limited return, we&#39;ll trust the under here. </p><h2>3. Noah Fant - Anytime Touchdown (+380)</h2><p>Kansas City&#39;s defense touts a disappointing 64.7% red zone percentage, a bottom-10 mark in the league. That&#39;s exactly why we have to target Denver&#39;s leading red-zone receiver, tight end Noah Fant. Fant leads the Broncos with 10 red zone targets and has converted that into 6 receptions and 3 TDs. Look for Denver to find the red zone and Fant to cash in on this prop.  </p><hr /><p><a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_15515b_1985c_&amp;affid=10543&amp;siteid=15515&amp;adid=1985&amp;c="><em><strong>Sign up</strong></em></a><em><strong> for FanDuel Sportsbook today and get your first bet risk free for up to $1,000!</strong></em></p><hr /><p><em>Adam Taylor McKillop is not a FanDuel employee.

FanDuel Sportsbook is currently listing the Chiefs as <a href="https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/football/nfl/denver-broncos-@-kansas-city-chiefs-31089793" target="_blank">9.5-point favorites</a> in the AFC West clash. </p><p>If you need some help with your fantasy lineups, here&#39;s some start &#39;em, sit &#39;em advice for this Week 13 showdown.</p><h2><strong>Javonte Williams Fantasy</strong></h2><p><strong>Start Javonte Williams, RB, Denver Broncos:</strong> Melvin Gordon has been <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/melvin-gordon-injury-update-could-skyrocket-javonte-williams-fantasy-outlook-01fny9qv63fm">officially ruled out of this one</a>. That leaves Javonte Williams with a lion&#39;s share of backfield opportunities against the Chiefs. He&#39;s been RB28 in PRR formats and that&#39;s with him playing only 47% of offensive snaps. Williams enters the week after finishing Week 12 as RB8, scoring 20.1 fantasy points. He has a chance to continue that momentum against a Kansas City squad giving up 20.1 fantasy PPG to running backs. </p><h2><strong>Clyde Edwards-Helaire Fantasy</strong></h2><p><strong>Start Clyde Edwards-Helaire, RB, Kansas City Chiefs:</strong> After missing five games due to injury, Clyde Edwards-Helaire returned in Week 11 with an RB14 finish in PPR. He looked great, averaging 5.25 rushing yards on 12 carries for a touchdown. While the Broncos have allowed the 12th-fewest fantasy points to rushers, they&#39;ve also surrendered 216 rushing yards to the Philadelphia Eagles two games ago. The Chiefs are a much better team than that and a positive game script could see Edwards-Helaire finish as an RB2 or better. </p><h2><strong>Courtland Sutton Fantasy</strong></h2><p><strong>Sit Courtland Sutton, WR, Denver Broncos:</strong> Courtland Sutton has been one of the bigger fantasy disappointments of late. Since Week 8, the fourth-year pro has been WR92 in PPR formats. No, that isn&#39;t a typo. He&#39;s averaged just 1.75 receptions on 3.0 targets for  95 yards over his last four games and hasn&#39;t scored a touchdown since Week 6. With the Chiefs improved defense and Sutton&#39;s declining play, fantasy managers likely have better options out there. </p><h2><strong>Mecole Hardman Fantasy</strong></h2><p><strong>Sit Mecole Hardman, WR, Kansas City Chiefs: </strong>Mecole Hardman is another wideout who hasn&#39;t lived up to expectations this season. He was supposed to be Kansas City&#39;s No. 2 wide receiver this year, however, he&#39;s WR53 leaguewide. Denver gives up the 14th-fewest fantasy points to wideouts, which doesn&#39;t bode well for a player who has four outings of fewer than 30 receiving yards in his last five games. Besides, he only played 18% of offensive snaps in Week 11, which makes him difficult to plug into any fantasy lineup. </p><hr /><p><a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_15515b_1985c_&amp;affid=10543&amp;siteid=15515&amp;adid=1985&amp;c=" target="_blank"><em><strong>Sign up</strong></em></a><em><strong> for FanDuel Sportsbook today and get your first bet risk free for up to $1,000!</strong></em></p><hr /><p><em>Devon Platana is not a FanDuel employee.

His fantasy outlook includes QB2 upside on Sunday.</p><figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gardner Minshew is starting today vs. the Jets, per league source.</p>— Tim McManus (@Tim_McManus) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tim_McManus/status/1467524451449331724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2021</a></blockquote></figure><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script><h2><strong>Gardner Minshew Fantasy Outlook</strong></h2><p>Of course, Minshew is no stranger to the NFL. He has started 20 games over his three-year career, with the most recent one coming as a Jacksonville Jaguar in Week 14 of last season. Overall, the 25-year-old averages 230.9 passing yards per game and has thrown 37 touchdowns compared to 11 interceptions.</p><p>Minshew has a chance to post QB2 numbers on Sunday facing a Jets&#39; defense that has been anything but dominant this year. In fact, New York has posted the second-worst pass defense DVOA rating in the league and is giving up the 11th-most fantasy points to opposing QBs.</p><p>The thing that makes Minshew stick out amongst most streaming quarterback options this week is his ability to tuck the ball and run. He has racked up 497 rushing yards across his 24 career games played. That certainly played a role in his finish as the No. 16 QB in fantasy scoring last year on a points-per-game basis.</p><p>Fantasy managers dealing with a quarterback bye week or simply stuck in a tough situation can feel comfortable picking Minshew up and sliding him into a starting spot. As long as he stays away from turning the ball over, Minshew has the offensive weapons to succeed in Week 13. </p><hr /><p><a href="https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/126086;4862626;369307;211;0/?ft_width=1&amp;ft_height=1&amp;gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D&amp;gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_78%7D&amp;gdpr_pd=$%7BGDPR_PD%7D&amp;us_privacy=$%7BUS_PRIVACY%7D&amp;url=28528311" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em><strong>SIGN UP</strong></em></a><em><strong> AND GET AN INSTANT DEPOSIT BONUS UP TO 500!

The third-year pro is in the midst of the best season of his career, rushing for a career-high 648 yards through 10 games played. Henderson is also averaging a healthy 4.6 yards per carry.</p><p>Keep an eye on Henderson&#39;s status up until kickoff at 4:05 p.m. and make sure to have a backup option ready to go.</p><h2><strong>Sony Michel Fantasy Outlook</strong></h2><p>Henderson&#39;s absence directly boosts the Week 13 fantasy outlook of backup Sony Michel. The first-year Ram is expected to take on the majority of the work alongside practice squad call-up Mekhi Sargent. Keep in mind Michel racked up 79 yards on 23 touches during his lone start of the year (Week 3).</p><p>Michel has a shot to run wild on Sunday <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/jaguars-vs-rams-prediction-odds-spread-over-under-betting-trends-nfl-week-13-game-fanduel-01fnv9wrc1jj">against a Jacksonville Jaguars&#39;</a> defense that has allowed 11 rushing touchdowns this season (No. 30 in NFL). The game script here also bodes well for the 26-year-old. The Rams are 13-point favorites and it wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see head coach Sean McVay lean on the running game throughout the second half in order to drain the clock.</p><p>Michel should be picked up across all league formats and has RB1 upside in Week 13. </p><hr /><p><a href="https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/126086;4862626;369307;211;0/?ft_width=1&amp;ft_height=1&amp;gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D&amp;gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_78%7D&amp;gdpr_pd=$%7BGDPR_PD%7D&amp;us_privacy=$%7BUS_PRIVACY%7D&amp;url=28528311" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em><strong>SIGN UP</strong></em></a><em><strong> AND GET AN INSTANT DEPOSIT BONUS UP TO 500!

The second-year pro was adamant on Saturday that he felt a lot better, though. The coaching staff likely just wants to see how Robinson looks in pre-game warmups before making a final designation.</p><p>Robinson slides back into his role as a reliable RB2 in fantasy football this week. The 23-year-old has seen at least 15 opportunities (carries + targets) in each of his last three games and is averaging an impressive 5.1 yards per carry on the year. Overall, he ranks as the No. 15 RB in PPR scoring leagues.</p><p>Facing the Rams is going to be no easy task as they have posted the eighth-best rush defense DVOA rating. However, Robinson&#39;s ability to find the end zone is what makes him truly valuable. The Jaguars&#39; ball-carrier has scored a touchdown in six of his last eight games and has seen a team-high 21 touches in the red zone this season. </p><p>Robinson is a rock-solid starter at a RB position constantly disrupted by injuries and checks in at RB15 in The Duel&#39;s <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/week-13-fantasy-football-rankings-by-position-ppr-qb-rb-wr-te-kicker-defense-01fnp3ffbcf9">Week 13 fantasy football rankings</a>.</p><hr /><p><a href="https://servedby.flashtalking.com/click/8/126086;4862626;369307;211;0/?ft_width=1&amp;ft_height=1&amp;gdpr=$%7BGDPR%7D&amp;gdpr_consent=$%7BGDPR_CONSENT_78%7D&amp;gdpr_pd=$%7BGDPR_PD%7D&amp;us_privacy=$%7BUS_PRIVACY%7D&amp;url=28528311" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em><strong>SIGN UP</strong></em></a><em><strong> AND GET AN INSTANT DEPOSIT BONUS UP TO 500!

The former All-Pro player was limited in practice for most of the week and missed the entirety of Thursday&#39;s session.  </p><p>Kendricks has been electric for the Vikings this season, recording 109 total tackles while tying his previous career high with 4.0 sacks. Fortunately, Detroit has the third-worst offense in the NFL (15.8 PPG), so he wouldn&#39;t be needed too much even if he was playing. </p><h2><strong>Kene Nwangwu Injury Update</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, running back Kene Nwangwu is questionable with an illness. The 2021 fourth-round pick was slated to be Alexander Mattison&#39;s backup with Dalvin Cook <a href="https://www.fanduel.com/theduel/posts/dalvin-cook-week-13-is-dalvin-cook-playing-this-week-vikings-01fnppq3c6pz">sidelined due to a shoulder injury</a>. </p><p>Nwangwu has looked electric as Minnesota&#39;s kick returner as of late. He has 330 yards on seven returns over his last four games (47.1 YPR) and has scored two touchdowns in the process. </p><p>If Nwangwu is forced to miss Week 13, the Vikings don&#39;t have any other healthy RBs on their 53-man roster aside from Mattison.  </p><hr /><p><a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_15515b_1985c_&amp;affid=10543&amp;siteid=15515&amp;adid=1985&amp;c="><em><strong>Sign up</strong></em></a><em><strong> for FanDuel Sportsbook today and get your first bet risk free for up to $1,000!</strong></em></p><hr /><p><em>Devon Platana is not a FanDuel employee.

But, it&#39;s looking like the game could be affected by some pretty wild Buffalo weather. </p><h2>Buffalo Weather Monday Night</h2><p>As of Saturday morning, Monday&#39;s forecast from <a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/buffalo/14202/daily-weather-forecast/349726?day=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AccuWeather</a> points to it being likely that both team&#39;s offense will have to battle the elements. </p><h2><strong>Patriots vs Bills Weather</strong></h2><p>The forecast calls for showers throughout most of Monday, with winds gusting over 40mph. </p><p>AccuWeather&#39;s high wind watch is projected to end right before kickoff. That&#39;s when the temperature is forecasted to dropm though. It&#39;s supposed to get as low as 30°F, which could feel like 12°F with the windchill. </p><p>If the precipitation continues late into the game while the temperature drops, it&#39;s possible the Patriots and Bills will have to deal with snow as well. Couple that with wind gusts and it could be a messy game for everyone on the field.</p><p>With the weather being an obstacle, FanDuel Sportsbook is projecting it to be a low-scoring game, with an <a href="https://sportsbook.fanduel.com/football/nfl/new-england-patriots-@-buffalo-bills-31089810" target="_blank">over/under total of 40.5 points</a>. </p><hr /><p><a href="http://wlfanduel.adsrv.eacdn.com/C.ashx?btag=a_15515b_1985c_&amp;affid=10543&amp;siteid=15515&amp;adid=1985&amp;c="><em><strong>Sign up</strong></em></a><em><strong> for FanDuel Sportsbook today and get your first bet risk free for up to $1,000!</strong></em></p><hr /><p><em>Devon Platana is not a FanDuel employee.
