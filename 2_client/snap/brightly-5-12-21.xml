			<p>K-Cups revolutionized <a data-lasso-id="63703" href="https://brightly.eco/sustainable-coffee-routine/">coffee</a>. You can make a single mug with the press of a button. But as any Keurig owner knows, the ease comes at a cost: a whole lot of <a data-lasso-id="63704" href="https://brightly.eco/how-to-use-less-plastic/">plastic waste</a> in landfills. </p>



<p>Many consumers started brewing their own coffee at home during the pandemic, which gained Keurig <a data-lasso-id="66505" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/select/shopping/keurig-smart-wifi-ncna1275077" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three million new users</a> in 2020 alone. With an estimated 33 million households having Keurigs, billions of K-Cups are being disposed of every year. But are K-Cups recyclable like Keurig claims, or are they being sent straight to the landfill?</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">Here&#x2019;s everything a recycling expert wants you to know before brewing your next cup of coffee.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-k-cups-recyclable">Are K-Cups Recyclable?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-1024x683.jpg" alt="are k-cups recyclable" class="wp-image-47567" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>So, are K-Cups recyclable? Even though Keurig claims they are <a data-lasso-id="66034" href="https://www.keurig.com/recyclable" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on its website</a>, Rosie Briggs, the community education and engagement manager at <a data-lasso-id="66506" href="https://www.ecocycle.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eco-Cycle</a>, says there&#x2019;s a lot more to the story.</p>



<p>In 2020, Keurig converted its K-Cups from #7 plastic (which is nearly impossible to recycle) to polypropylene, a #5 plastic. While that switch may sound better in theory, the reality is <a data-lasso-id="63707" href="https://brightly.eco/types-plastic-recycling/">only 3%</a> of polypropylene plastic products get recycled in the United States. But the type of plastic is only part of the problem.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">K-Cups are an environmental nightmare for many reasons,&#x201D; says Briggs. <meta charset="utf-8">&#x201C;<meta charset="utf-8">Even if it&#x2019;s a #5 plastic, which is more recyclable than a #7, it will still have other materials incorporated into the product, not to mention the coffee grounds&#x2014;a huge contaminant for plastics markets (or any market).&#x201D;</p>



<p>A K-Cup can&#x2019;t be recycled as a whole. Even in order to <em>attempt</em> to recycle the #5 plastic pod, you need to do the very tricky and time-consuming task of separating the K-Cup components, which include a plastic cup, a filter, coffee grounds, and an aluminum foil top. <meta charset="utf-8">The coffee grounds and filter <a data-lasso-id="63708" href="https://brightly.eco/what-can-you-compost/">can be composted</a>, and the aluminum top has to go in the trash.</p>



<p>Unless you perfectly separate these components before putting the K-Cup in your recycling bin, it will end up in a landfill. But even if you do take the time to separate the components, the chances of them getting recycled are still slim.</p>



<p>&#x201C;<meta charset="utf-8">Let&#x2019;s say it was only made of one material, and that we had a buyer for that material. Even then, a K-Cup is too small to pass through a standard Materials Recovery Facility (MRF), which is where your recyclables get sorted from one another. So most likely, the cup will fall through the &#x2018;fines screen&#x2019; and contaminate the glass screen.&#x201D;</p>



<p>So, are K-Cups recyclable? The reality is, <a href="https://brightly.eco/california-misleading-recycling-symbol-ban/" data-lasso-id="66507">like with many products</a>, the recycling symbol at the bottom of the pod is very misleading. With that being said, Briggs says recycling programs and infrastructure vary from place to place, so it&#x2019;s always a good idea to call your local recycling center and ask if they accept them.</p>



<p>&#x201C;While K-Cups aren&#x2019;t recyclable through my program, another program might say they take them. This is because they may have lower-grade plastics markets, a pilot program, or looser communication guidelines for the public and sort them out as contamination,&#x201D; Briggs says. &#x201C;But generally, K-Cups are not recyclable. If they were getting recycled in the past, I&#x2019;d imagine they were getting shipped to China (which is no longer an option due to the <meta charset="utf-8">passage of China&#x2019;s <a data-lasso-id="66508" href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/piling-up-how-chinas-ban-on-importing-waste-has-stalled-global-recycling" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x2018;National Sword&#x2019; policy</a>), where there was little to no transparency about what happened to them.&#x201D;</p>



<h2>The Solution? Go the Reusable Route</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-2.jpg" alt="are k-cups recyclable" class="wp-image-47568" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-2.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/are-k-cups-recyclable-2-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>At this point, you know K-Cups aren&#x2019;t recyclable in most cases. But recyclability isn&#x2019;t the only issue. According to Briggs, it&#x2019;s also important to remember it isn&#x2019;t just about where the item goes when you&#x2019;re done with it. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s about the many resources it took to make that item and get it to you,&#x201D; she says.</p>



<p><meta charset="utf-8">&#x201C;In this case, oil and gas are fracked from the earth, aluminum is strip-mined from bauxite in the tropics, huge amounts of energy and water are used to refine them, huge amounts of emissions are made from transporting it all around the world and to you&#x2026; you get the picture,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;So even if you could painstakingly take apart your pod to recycle it, think about whether those&#xA0;upstream&#xA0;resources and emissions are worth it to you.&#x201D;</p>



<p>How about <a href="https://brightly.eco/compostable-meaning/" data-lasso-id="66567">compostable</a> coffee pods? While they seem like a better option, you&#x2019;re still dealing with similar issues. </p>



<p>&#x201C;Even if it&#x2019;s BPI certified compostable (many aren&#x2019;t), and even if you have access to an industrial composter (most folks don&#x2019;t), that thing is still single-use,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s representing a linear use of resources.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Briggs says the best option for the planet is avoiding K-Cups altogether, or at least as much as you can. If you have a Keurig machine at home or at work, you can still make your coffee routine more eco-friendly by using a <a href="https://www.target.com/p/keurig-my-k-cup-universal-reusable-filter-multi-stream-technology/-/A-52532575#lnk=sametab" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66568">reusable coffee filter</a>. At $10, it will save you money <em>and </em>allow you to use more sustainable coffee, including <a href="https://brightly.eco/fair-trade-coffee-brands/" data-lasso-id="66569">Fair Trade coffee</a> options.</p>



<p>Yes, it&#x2019;s a bummer that these plastic pods aren&#x2019;t as recyclable as they&#x2019;re said to be. Luckily, with a simple swap, you can sip your morning cup of Joe worry-free.</p>

      <description>Instead of roasting chestnuts this holiday season, grow your own chestnut plant! Here's how to go about it in five simple steps.</description>

			<p>You may have grown up humming the lyrics to the classic holiday song, &#x201C;Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire.&#x201D; But instead of roasting them, why not turn one into an adorable chestnut plant <a href="https://brightly.eco/easy-houseplants-take-care-of/" data-lasso-id="66495">for your home</a>?</p>



<p>While turning a chestnut into a cute houseplant <em>probably</em> isn&#x2019;t something you envisioned yourself doing over the holidays, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bradcanning/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66496">Brad Canning</a>, the plant aficionado behind&#xA0;<a href="https://www.instagram.com/leafy.lane/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66497">Leafy Lane</a>, says the process is super easy. In fact, it&#x2019;s very similar to growing an <a href="https://brightly.eco/how-grow-avocado-plant-from-pit/" data-lasso-id="66498">avocado plant</a> and <a href="https://brightly.eco/mango-seed-plant/" data-lasso-id="66499">mango seed plant</a>.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>According to Canning, all you need to get started is an unroasted chestnut, reusable Stasher bag, and a damp paper towel. Whether you have a green thumb or not (<em>psst</em>&#x2014;check out these <a href="https://brightly.eco/hard-to-kill-plants/" data-lasso-id="66500">hard-to-kill plants</a>!), following these steps will give you a chestnut plant in no time.</p>

<p><em>What you&#x2019;ll need:</em></p>



<p>unroasted chestnut<br>reusable bag<br>damp paper towel</p>



<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>



<p>1. Wrap the chestnut in a paper towel and put it in a reusable bag.<br>2. After sealing the bag, store it in a cool, dry place for a few weeks (like a pantry) and wait for the roots to sprout. <br>3. Once you notice roots, put the roots in a cup or vase of water. Be sure the chestnut stays dry and out of the water. Using a vase with a narrow opening will help.<br>4. Soon, you&#x2019;ll notice the plant sprout from the top of the chestnut. (Aka the start of a chestnut tree!)<br>5. Keep it in the vase and change the water every few days. Or pot it in a container with a drainage hole and water when the top layer of soil is dry, around once a week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="elementor-widget-container">
			<p>Canned black beans are almost too easy to accumulate. Maybe you picked up a few cans on sale and need some new ideas. Or maybe you decided to take the plunge into <a href="https://brightly.eco/alicia-silverstone-interview/" data-lasso-id="66224">plant-based eating</a> and have no idea <meta charset="utf-8">how to prepare the protein-packed <a href="https://brightly.eco/legume-recipes/" data-lasso-id="66225">legume</a>. Either way, these canned black bean recipes are here to help.</p>



<p>Black beans pack quite the nutritional punch for being so tiny. Aside from being a great source of protein and fiber, a <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/12/031205053236.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66226">past study</a> found they also contain 10 times the antioxidants of an equivalent serving of oranges. Like we said&#x2014;powerful is an understatement.</p>



<p>Aside from being nutritious, black beans are also planet-friendly. According to a study published in the journal <em><a href="https://trophiccascades.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/trophic/files/Beans_for_Beef.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66227">Climatic Change</a></em>, if Americans swapped beef for beans, we&#x2019;d be on track to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions (one of the leading causes of <a href="https://brightly.eco/what-is-climate-change/" data-lasso-id="66228">climate change</a>) by 334 million metric tons per year.</p>



<p>Thankfully, beans are super inexpensive and are a staple in many cultures and cuisines. You don&#x2019;t need anything fancy to prepare them, either. Ready to get to cooking? These delicious canned black bean recipes will have your pantry empty in no time.</p>

<p>Skillet meals like this one make for a delicious and hearty meal. Feel free to swap out the spicy peppers for bell peppers if that&#x2019;s more your style. The combination of rice, beans, cheese, and tomato will melt in your mouth.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re one of those people who think cilantro tastes like soap (yes, that&#x2019;s a thing!), we promise it&#x2019;s totally fine to skip that part of this recipe. Between the black beans, garlic, fire-roasted tomatoes, and onion, this soup provides a warm and cozy winter staple.</p>

<p>Okay, we already know black beans are great for breakfast and dinner. But dessert, too? It&#x2019;s true: These brownies are super fudgy, chocolatey, and delicious, and you can&#x2019;t even taste the beans.</p>

<p>The black beans in this dish make a great sauce to accompany a chicken and rice dish. It&#x2019;s a light meal that still tastes great, with sesame oil and garlic as the main flavors. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>This popular black bean dessert is super common in Vietnam and works well as both a hot dessert (think of a warm custard) or a cold dessert (like an icy bubble tea). It takes a little longer to prepare than some of the other canned black bean recipes on this list, but we promise it&#x2019;s worth the wait.</p>

			<p>Colorful loofahs made from plastic mesh are a staple in many showers. But while they&#x2019;re pretty, the material doesn&#x2019;t exactly make them eco-friendly. That&#x2019;s where natural loofahs come in. </p>



<p>Made from the loofah plant&#x2014;yes, a plant!&#x2014;they&#x2019;re completely natural and 100% <a href="https://brightly.eco/biodegradable-meaning/" data-lasso-id="66173">biodegradable</a> and <a href="https://brightly.eco/compostable-meaning/" data-lasso-id="66174">compostable</a>. And, you can learn how to grow a loofah plant in your own garden.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-grow-loofah-plant-sponge-1024x683.jpg" alt="how to grow a loofah plant sponge" class="wp-image-47379" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-grow-loofah-plant-sponge-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-grow-loofah-plant-sponge-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-grow-loofah-plant-sponge-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-grow-loofah-plant-sponge-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-to-grow-loofah-plant-sponge.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Photo: Eden Brothers</figcaption></figure>



<p>Growing your own bath sponge sounds too good to be true, but it&#x2019;s totally possible. Loofahs&#x2014;also called luffas or loofas&#x2014;belong to the gourd family. </p>



<p>While the loofah plant can be eaten when harvested early, waiting it out will give you an eco-friendly sponge. Amy, the gardener behind the Instagram account <a data-lasso-id="3676" href="https://www.instagram.com/chicksandveg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@chicksandveg</a>, learned how to grow her own loofahs last year and has been sharing her tips ever since.</p>

<p>&#x201C;Luffa refers to two species of gourd: <em>Luffa aegyptiaca </em>(the ridged or angled luffa) and <em>L. acutangular </em>(the smooth luffa, which I grow),&#x201D; she said on Instagram. &#x201C;Both species are used pretty much interchangeably and both belong to the gourd family. Luffas are annual vines and product fruits (luffas) and beautiful yellow flowers.&#x201D;</p>



<p>Because they&#x2019;re gourds, they&#x2019;re related to things like cucumbers, melons, squash, and watermelon. In fact, they actually look like zucchini when they&#x2019;re growing. If you let a loofah plant completely dry out after reaching maturity, you&#x2019;ll be able to remove the skin and harvest your very own natural loofah sponge.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-grow-a-loofah-plant">How to Grow a Loofah Plant</h2>



<p>Want to learn how to grow a loofah plant? Amy shared her entire process on Instagram, from germinating the seeds to removing the dried skin. Because while you can buy a natural loofah at the store, growing one yourself is <em>so </em>much more satisfying.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-get-some-seeds">1. Get Some Seeds</h3>



<p>First, buy some seeds. You <a data-lasso-id="3685" href="https://www.edenbrothers.com/store/gourd_seeds_luffa.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can find them online</a> or check greenhouses, farmers&#x2019; markets, and garden stores in your area.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-germinate-your-seeds">2. Germinate Your Seeds</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-11.jpg" alt="how to grow a loofah plant" class="wp-image-47373" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-11.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-11-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"><figcaption>Photo: Amy of @chicksandveg</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Next, germinate your seeds. Amy says you can speed up the process with the snipping method. &#x201C;Snip the end off&#x2014;the round, non-pinched end&#x2014;and wrap the seed in a wet paper towel. Then place it somewhere dark and warm,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Then leave it for a few days to germinate.&#x201D;</p>



<h3 id="h-3-plant-your-seeds">3. Plant Your Seeds</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-22.jpg" alt="how to grow a loofah plant" class="wp-image-47374" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-22.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-22-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-22-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-22-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"><figcaption>Photo: Amy of @chicksandveg</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once your seeds have tiny roots, you can plant them in small pots. Put a small hole in the soil, and place your seed in it with the root pointing down. Lightly cover the seed so it&#x2019;s no longer exposed. Water, put it in a warm and sunny spot&#x2014;like a windowsill&#x2014;then wait.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-repot-if-necessary">4. Repot If Necessary</h3>



<p>Once a loofah plant has outgrown its pot&#x2014;with <a data-lasso-id="3686" href="https://brightly.eco/when-repot-plant/">roots coming out of the bottom</a>&#x2014;transfer it to a slightly bigger pot and keep it in a warm and sunny spot.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-plant-in-your-garden">5. Plant in Your Garden</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="384" height="522" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-5.jpg" alt="how to grow a loofah" class="wp-image-17731" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-5.jpg 384w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-5-221x300.jpg 221w" sizes="(max-width: 384px) 100vw, 384px"><figcaption>Photo: Amy of @chicksandveg</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Once it&#x2019;s nice enough outside&#x2014;aka no more frost!&#x2014;you can plant the seeds in your garden, just like you&#x2019;d plant any other squash or gourd. If you have a greenhouse, even better: That&#x2019;s where Amy grows hers, and she says loofah plants love the heat. If space is an issue, no worries: &#x201C;You could try a South-facing wall or even indoors,&#x201D; she says.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-harvest-your-loofahs">6. Harvest Your Loofahs</h3>



<p>Your loofahs are almost ready to harvest once you notice they&#x2019;ve stopped growing and the vine starts to die. While Amy says you can leave them on the vine to dry in warmer climates, she decided to cut hers off and dry them indoors where she could keep a closer eye on them. That also <a data-lasso-id="3687" href="https://brightly.eco/how-to-choose-a-plant/">ensures pests don&#x2019;t get to them</a> before you do.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-dry-out-your-loofahs">7. Dry Out Your Loofahs</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image size-large"><figure class="aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" width="429" height="564" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-6.jpg" alt class="wp-image-17730" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-6.jpg 429w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/how-grow-loofah-6-228x300.jpg 228w" sizes="(max-width: 429px) 100vw, 429px"><figcaption>Photo: Amy of @chicksandveg</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The drying process can be long for loofah plants. Amy says it took 4 to 6 weeks for hers to completely dry out. Once a loofah has completely dried and feels a little crispy, it&#x2019;s time to peel the skin off. What you&#x2019;re left with is a natural loofah you can use in the shower, as a kitchen sponge, and beyond.</p>

			<p>Candles are a <a href="https://brightly.eco/sustainable-home-decor-gifts/" data-lasso-id="66120">home&#x2019;s best friend</a>. From lavender to cinnamon to vanilla, they come in almost any scent you can possibly think of. But are all candles good for the environment? And does learning how to DIY candles of your own make a difference?</p>



<h2 id="h-the-issue-with-candles">The Issue with Candles</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-7.jpg" alt="diy candles" class="wp-image-47293" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-7.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-7-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-7-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Many candles are made with paraffin wax, which can release potentially dangerous chemicals into the atmosphere when burned. Because paraffin is a <a data-lasso-id="62432" href="https://www.greenamerica.org/toxic-candles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petroleum byproduct</a>, it can release soot, as well as <a href="https://cehn.org/our-work/eco-healthy-child-care/ehcc-faqs/candles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66121">toxic chemicals like toluene and benzene</a>, into the air&#x2014;aka things you definitely don&#x2019;t want to be breathing in while you&#x2019;re trying to relax.</p>



<p>According to Aneta Wierzbicka, a researcher and associate professor at Lund University in Sweden, candles are one of the most powerful sources of air pollution inside the home, next to cooking and tobacco use. In an interview for the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/science/randall-munroe-candle-xkcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66122">New York Times</a></em>, Wierzbicka recommends lighting candles in a well-ventilated room and using clean candles that don&#x2019;t have too many toxic additives. </p>



<p>If you&#x2019;re not sure about the exact ingredients in your candles and you want to light one <em>without</em> causing harm to yourself or the environment, DIY candles of your own! Follow these simple step-by-step instructions for a natural and eco-friendly option.</p>



<h2 id="h-diy-candles-step-by-step">DIY Candles, Step by Step</h2>



<h3>1. Gather Your Materials</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-6.jpg" alt="diy candles" class="wp-image-47294" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-6.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-6-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>The first step to candlemaking is gathering your tools. When shopping for wax, opt for all-natural, non-toxic wax. Soy wax, coconut wax, or beeswax will work perfectly. Avoid paraffin wax to keep your candles eco-friendly. Look for labels that say 100% beeswax, soy wax, or coconut wax to be sure that paraffin hasn&#x2019;t been added to the wax blend. </p>



<p>You&#x2019;ll also need a lead-free wick, clothespins or clips, and a heat-resistant vessel to hold your candle. Mason jars and mugs work well. If you have old candle jars, you can use those, too!</p>



<h3>2. Pick Your Scent</h3>



<p>Picking your scent is the best part, right? There are endless options to choose from, all of which will make your home smell amazing. To add a fragrance to your candle, find an all-natural essential oil to add to your wax. Make sure the oils are free of synthetic ingredients and check the label for 100% pure oil. You can also go fragrance-free if you like your candles unscented.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-insert-the-wick">3. Insert the Wick</h3>



<p>Once you have your materials and your chosen scent, it&#x2019;s time to make your candle. Make sure your lead-free wick is long enough for the vessel you&#x2019;ve chosen. Place it in the center of the bottom of your candle jar. The wick should stick out about half an inch from the top of the vessel (the longer the better) to make sure you&#x2019;ll have something to burn later.</p>



<h3>4. Melt the Wax and Pour</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-1.jpg" alt="diy candles" class="wp-image-47298" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-1.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-1-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Now you&#x2019;re ready to melt the wax. There are several ways to do this step, including heating the wax in the microwave or using a wax melter. If you use a microwave, heat the wax in 30-second intervals and stir until it&#x2019;s liquified. Once the wax is ready, add in a few drops of your scent of choice and stir.</p>



<p>Grab your potholders and pour the liquid into your heat-resistant candle vessel. This step is tedious. Make sure you don&#x2019;t move the wick around too much, and try to keep it in the center of the vessel while you pour. You can use clothespins or clips to hold it in place. </p>



<h3>5. Wait for the Wax to Harden</h3>



<p>Allow the candle to cool off for a few hours. Once the wax cools, you&#x2019;ll have a homemade candle! When the wax completely hardens, you can remove the clothespin from your wick and trim it to the desired length. The shorter the wick, the better&#x2014;as long as there&#x2019;s enough to burn. </p>



<h3>6. Light Your Candle</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-4.jpg" alt="diy candles" class="wp-image-47296" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-4.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/diy-candles-4-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Finally, you&#x2019;re ready to light your DIY candle with your favorite <a href="https://brightly.eco/rechargeable-lighter-sustainability/" data-lasso-id="66123">rechargeable lighter</a>. Don&#x2019;t leave your candle lit for more than an hour or two at a time, and never leave the lit candle unaccompanied. Also, be sure to trim the wick after each use. </p>



<h2 id="h-want-to-skip-some-steps">Want to Skip Some Steps?</h2>



<p>If you&#x2019;d like a little help making DIY candles, try a candlemaking kit. <a href="https://shop.brightly.eco/products/siblings-x-brightly-zero-waste-candle-kit?utm_source=internal&amp;utm_medium=product&amp;utm_campaign=blog&amp;utm_content=diycandlestory" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="66124">This option</a> comes with 10 ounces of all-natural coconut blend wax, a lead-free cotton wick, and a wooden wick holder. </p>



<p>The wax is non-toxic, free of parabens, paraffin, and phthalates. When ready, the candle burns for up to 60 hours. Just like making the DIY candles above, you can use whichever vessel you already have on hand.</p>



<p>Whether you make DIY candles from scratch or skip some steps with a kit, basking in the glow of your all-natural and eco-friendly candle couldn&#x2019;t be a better way to unwind at the end of a long day.</p>

      <description>Having a sustainable and eco-friendly Christmas is easier than you think! Here's the scoop on holiday decor, sustainable gifting, and more.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="elementor-widget-container">
			<p>We love Christmas here in North America. It seems like as soon as <a href="https://brightly.eco/how-to-have-an-eco-friendly-halloween/" data-lasso-id="65544">Halloween</a> is over, we&#x2019;re all ready to blast some Mariah Carey. But cheery music aside, the holiday season has a huge carbon footprint.</p>



<p>Between Thanksgiving and New Year&#x2019;s Day, Americans toss out&#xA0;<a href="https://brightly.eco/eco-friendly-thanksgiving/" data-lasso-id="65545">25% more trash</a> than the rest of the year.&#xA0;But not even <a href="https://brightly.eco/eco-friendly-thanksgiving/" data-lasso-id="65546">Thanksgiving</a>, where 200 million pounds of turkey go into the trash, can compete with Christmas. Between the food waste, packaging, wrapping paper, and greeting cards, we throw away more trash on Christmas than at any other time of year.</p>



<p>Just because we&#x2019;ve been wasteful in previous years doesn&#x2019;t mean we have to continue the trend. Instead, take a look at these super easy tips for having an eco-friendly Christmas.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-ways-to-have-an-eco-friendly-christmas"><meta charset="utf-8">7 Ways to Have an Eco-Friendly Christmas</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-wrap-using-newspaper-or-furoshiki">1. Wrap Using Newspaper or Furoshiki</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/furoshiki-gift-wrapping-technique.jpg" alt="furoshiki" class="wp-image-43628" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/furoshiki-gift-wrapping-technique.jpg 617w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/furoshiki-gift-wrapping-technique-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Wrapping paper is <a href="https://brightly.eco/is-wrapping-paper-recyclable/" data-lasso-id="65547">notoriously hard (if not impossible) to recycle</a>. Even though the glossy paper looks amazing, most of it ends up in the landfill. To reduce waste, opt for <a data-lasso-id="64371" href="https://brightly.eco/eco-friendly-gift-wrapping-ideas/">eco-friendly gift wrapping</a> options like newspaper. That way, it can easily get recycled or composted afterward. </p>



<p>Or, even better, skip the paper altogether! <a data-lasso-id="64372" href="https://brightly.eco/furoshiki-gift-wrapping-technique/">Furoshiki</a> is an endlessly reusable wrapping cloth that&#x2019;s been used in Japan for over 1,200 years. There are so many different patterns to choose from, as well as wrapping techniques.</p>



<h3>2. Choose Secondhand Decor</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw-1024x683.jpg" alt="eco friendly christmas" class="wp-image-47226" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/iuhcr15bznw.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>If you go into a secondhand shop right now, you&#x2019;re bound to notice an impressive holiday season filled with beautiful decor from recent years and years past. (Hello, gorgeous <a href="https://brightly.eco/online-vintage-clothing-stores/" data-lasso-id="65548">vintage</a> items!)</p>



<p>Thrifting for holiday decor isn&#x2019;t just a more sustainable option than buying new. It also makes your space unique! No one will have the same wreath, ornaments, and table settings as you.</p>



<h3>3. DIY What You Can</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="681" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm-1024x681.jpg" alt="eco friendly christmas" class="wp-image-47223" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm-768x511.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm-624x415.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/izpkjgcxgfm.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>DIY projects come in handy around Christmas. Not just for saving some money and upcycling what you already have, but also because it&#x2019;s super satisfying knowing you made something yourself. </p>



<p>If you&#x2019;re crafty, this is your time to shine! Homemade gifts like pillowcases, coasters, and <a data-lasso-id="64373" href="https://brightly.eco/crochet-tote-bag-tutorial/">tote bags</a> all make for great Christmas presents. There are also plenty of projects for DIY newbies, like making your own <a href="https://brightly.eco/diy-christmas-ornaments/" data-lasso-id="65549">DIY Christmas ornaments</a> out of pinecones or dehydrated orange slices.</p>



<h3>4. Give Sustainable Gifts (Including Experiences!)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg-1024x683.jpg" alt="gold and silver gift box" class="wp-image-45486" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/cnrduy0tfrg.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Sustainable gifting is a huge part of having an eco-friendly Christmas. Luckily, it&#x2019;s not hard to find something perfect for your loved ones <em>and </em>the planet.</p>



<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://brightly.eco/gifts/" data-lasso-id="65550">gifts</a> to choose from. You could opt for <a href="https://brightly.eco/top-experience-gifts/" data-lasso-id="65551">top experience gifts</a> (like a cooking class, museum pass, or concert), <a href="https://brightly.eco/clean-beauty-gifts/" data-lasso-id="65552">clean beauty gifts</a> (skincare, makeup, and beyond!), <a href="https://brightly.eco/sustainable-gifts-for-men/" data-lasso-id="65553">sustainable gifts for men</a> (like a chef&#x2019;s kit), and more. There&#x2019;s something for everyone&#x2014;even the hardest to shop for.</p>



<h3>5. Make Plant-Based Holiday Recipes</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o-1024x684.jpg" alt="eco friendly christmas" class="wp-image-47139" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o-768x513.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o-624x417.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/tu0ncdw7v4o.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Plant-based meals are more eco-friendly than meals that contain meat and dairy. In fact, going vegetarian can <a href="https://brightly.eco/sustainable-diets/" data-lasso-id="65554">cut your emissions by about half</a>, and going vegan can cut your emissions by up to 85%. When you&#x2019;re deciding which <a href="https://brightly.eco/most-popular-holiday-recipes-in-every-state/" data-lasso-id="65555">holiday recipes</a> to make this year, consider making some of them plant-based.</p>



<p>If you don&#x2019;t want to make a dish entirely plant-based, consider some planet-friendly swaps. Even using an alt-milk like <a href="https://brightly.eco/oat-milk-brands/" data-lasso-id="65556">oat milk</a> instead of <a href="https://brightly.eco/the-environmental-impacts-of-different-dairy-and-dairy-free-milk/" data-lasso-id="65557">dairy milk</a> in a recipe can decrease your overall carbon footprint over the holidays.</p>



<h3>6. Opt for Eco-Friendly Christmas Cards</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brightly-wishcloth-5-1024x683.jpg" alt="brightly wishcloth" class="wp-image-43518" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brightly-wishcloth-5-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brightly-wishcloth-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brightly-wishcloth-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brightly-wishcloth-5-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/brightly-wishcloth-5.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Christmas cards are an essential part of the holidays. Whether you mail cards to faraway family members or attach them to every gift you give, it&#x2019;s a beloved tradition. Unfortunately, it&#x2019;s also a wasteful one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://brightly.eco/environmental-impact-of-greeting-cards/" data-lasso-id="65558">environmental impact of greeting cards</a> is a lot worse than people assume. Not only are many difficult to recycle and therefore tossed in the trash, but sending them is also an issue. <meta charset="utf-8">The U.S. mails 1.3 billion holiday cards a year, which is the same amount of CO2 emissions as charging 22 billion smartphones or 22,000 homes&#x2019; energy use for one year.</p>



<p>When you&#x2019;re shopping for cards, look for the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) logo. This means the paper was responsibly sourced. Also, look for recyclable options to help keep paper waste out of landfills. You could even gift a <a href="https://brightly.eco/how-to-use-a-wishcloth/" data-lasso-id="65559">Wishcloth</a>, which is a greeting card and reusable dishcloth in one. If you want additional ideas for eco-friendly greeting cards, <a href="https://brightly.eco/environmental-impact-of-greeting-cards/" data-lasso-id="65560">click here</a>.</p>



<h3>7. Choose Quality Over Quantity</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc-1024x683.jpg" alt="eco friendly christmas" class="wp-image-47143" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ipx7j1n_xuc.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Remember that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xgjdsy1MpR0&amp;ab_channel=FluroWaves" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="65561">scene</a> in the first <em>Harry Potter</em> movie where Dudley is complaining that he only received 36 presents from his parents because he received 37 presents the year prior? While humorous (and a little bit cringe), <a href="https://brightly.eco/how-avoid-overconsumption/" data-lasso-id="65562">overconsumption</a> is a huge problem in the U.S.: we&#x2019;re buying too much, and a lot of it goes into the trash.</p>



<p>If you&#x2019;re worried you aren&#x2019;t buying enough gifts this Christmas, try choosing items of quality instead of quantity. Choosing slow-produced or handmade clothing over items from <a href="https://brightly.eco/fast-fashion-brands-sustainability/" data-lasso-id="65563">fast fashion brands</a>, for instance, ensures those items last for years to come.</p>

      <description>According to Zillow's new report, these sustainable and eco-friendly home upgrades will sell your house in record time.</description>
      <media:thumbnail url="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eco-friendly-home-upgrades-4.jpg" caption=""/>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="elementor-widget-container">
			<p>If it seems like everyone around you is starting to <a href="https://brightly.eco/what-is-an-eco-village/" data-lasso-id="65253">make their homes a little more eco-friendly</a>, you&#x2019;re not imagining things. According to Zillow&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/earth-tones-and-eco-friendly-features-top-zillows-2022-home-trends-301433762.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="65254">2022 Home Trends</a> report, green living is more popular than ever.</p>



<p>In the report, popular home trends included choosing earthy colors (like greens, blues, taupes, and browns) to create a calm environment in the home, as well as making home improvements that prioritize <a href="https://brightly.eco/eco-anxiety/" data-lasso-id="65255">mental health</a> (like adding a <a href="https://brightly.eco/online-used-bookstores/" data-lasso-id="65256">reading nook</a> or creating a space for meditation). </p>



<p>Sustainability also stole the show, with Zillow saying it&#x2019;s a top priority for younger homeowners who are looking to buy.</p>



<h2 id="h-sustainable-homes-are-flying-off-the-market">Sustainable Homes Are Flying Off the Market</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eco-friendly-home-upgrades-1.jpg" alt="eco-friendly home upgrades report" class="wp-image-47174" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eco-friendly-home-upgrades-1.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eco-friendly-home-upgrades-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eco-friendly-home-upgrades-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/eco-friendly-home-upgrades-1-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>According to the report, younger generations are most likely to make purchases based on their values. That includes homes that have eco-friendly features, like being <a href="https://brightly.eco/vampire-power/" data-lasso-id="65257">energy-efficient</a> or having features that <a href="https://brightly.eco/zero-waste-products-to-kickstart-your-journey/" data-lasso-id="65258">cut down on waste</a>. Homes that mention terms like &#x201C;eco&#x201D; or &#x201C;energy-efficient&#x201D; in the description fly off the market, more than two days faster than expected.</p>



<p>In addition, the report says listings that mentioned drought-resistant features sold 13 days faster. And homes that had smart sprinkler systems and double pane windows installed to conserve energy sold a week quicker than expected. So if you&#x2019;re looking to upgrade your own home to sell, you know exactly which eco features to add.</p>

<p>That twist may be busting out the vintage wallpaper or opting for all-wood kitchens. Instead of being a cookie-cutter space, every home winds up with a one-of-a-kind look. </p>

			<p>It&#x2019;s the most wonderful time of the year again, meaning we get to celebrate the holiday season with delicious <a data-lasso-id="63852" href="https://brightly.eco/most-popular-holiday-recipes-in-every-state/">holiday recipes</a>, great <a data-lasso-id="63853" href="https://brightly.eco/gifts/">gifts</a>, and our loved ones. But with how busy it is, sustainability <em>probably</em> isn&#x2019;t one of your top priorities. We&#x2019;re here to change that. </p>



<p>While the holidays are filled with joy, some of our beloved traditions can be wasteful. Between <a data-lasso-id="63645" href="https://brightly.eco/food-waste-landfill/">food waste</a>, gift wrap, and <a data-lasso-id="63646" href="https://brightly.eco/holiday-travel-sustainability/">holiday travel</a> emissions, this season can take a toll on the environment. Luckily, there are some simple ways to celebrate the holidays and continue your beloved traditions sustainably. </p>



<p>In the latest episode of <em><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-together-ethical-eco-friendly-sustainable-living/id1474709653" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63855">Good Together</a></em>, Laura and Liza discussed their favorite zero-waste Christmas tips. Here are five ways to have a low-waste holiday season this year, from choosing the most eco-friendly Christmas tree to opting for more sustainable decorations.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-have-a-zero-waste-christmas">How to Have a Zero-Waste Christmas</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-choose-the-best-christmas-tree-for-you">1. Choose the Best Christmas Tree for You</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8-1024x683.jpg" alt="Christmas tree" class="wp-image-47036" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/7dp9pomkci8.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>There&#x2019;s a lot of debate around which Christmas tree is the most sustainable&#x2014;even on <a data-lasso-id="63648" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CH0OS9OFrmU/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own Instagram post</a>! Faux trees have their pros and cons, just as live trees have theirs. Let&#x2019;s see what those pros and cons are so you can make the best decision for your living room.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-pros-of-displaying-a-faux-tree">Pros of Displaying a Faux Tree</h4>



<p>Plastic trees might seem unsustainable because of their main component: plastic. However, there are some situations in which a faux tree is the better choice for a zero-waste holiday season, especially if you can use it for many years to come. </p>



<p>For example, if you or someone in your family is allergic to live trees, having one in the house means a month or two of sneezing and itching. More people suffer from <a data-lasso-id="63649" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/AllergiesNews/allergic-christmas/story?id=9352656" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christmas tree allergies</a> than you may think, which some medical professionals say is caused by the sap, pollen, or mold a live pine tree brings into your home.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Faux trees aren&#x2019;t just the best choice for those with allergies. They&#x2019;re also a more sustainable option for those who live in places where pine trees aren&#x2019;t native. For example, Texans might be better off buying a plastic tree and using it for years rather than buying a live tree that traveled from hundreds of miles away.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-cons-of-faux-trees">Cons of Faux Trees</h4>



<p>Faux trees are made from PVC plastic, lead, and other materials that leave a massive carbon footprint. Many are also <a data-lasso-id="63651" href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/dec/19/santas-real-workshop-the-town-in-china-that-makes-the-worlds-christmas-decorations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made primarily in China</a> before being shipped around the world.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Not only is faux tree production potentially harmful to workers, but the carbon footprint of the materials and shipping that go into a plastic tree is very high.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-sustainable-faux-options">Sustainable Faux Options</h4>



<p>There are a few ways to have a more sustainable faux tree decking your halls.&#xA0;</p>



<p>First, buy a secondhand faux tree. Check out local thrift stores for your next tree or check community apps like Craigslist and NextDoor. Facebook Marketplace is also a great option for finding a new-to-you tree.</p>



<p>Second, if you buy a new fake tree, buy a classic style that isn&#x2019;t too large. Pink tinsel trees might be popular on Pinterest, but they won&#x2019;t be in style much longer. Stick to a classic green tree and choose an average size so that you can keep your tree through many moves (and many years) to come.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Lastly, pick up a tree storage bag so that your tree is protected between holiday seasons. Maintaining your tree means you&#x2019;ll be able to use it again and again.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-pros-of-buying-a-live-tree">Pros of Buying a Live Tree</h4>



<p>On the other hand, there&#x2019;s something special about the experience of choosing a live tree, whether you chop it down at a local Christmas tree farm or pick one out in the Home Depot parking lot.&#xA0;</p>



<p>According to the National Christmas Tree Association, it can take <a data-lasso-id="63653" href="https://realchristmastrees.org/education/quick-tree-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">up to 15 years for a tree to grow</a> 6 to 7 feet tall, and the average growing time is about seven years. During that time, the trees provide homes for local wildlife.&#xA0;</p>



<p>In addition to providing a home for <a data-lasso-id="63654" href="https://brightly.eco/endangered-animals-threatened-by-climate-change/">local wildlife</a>, buying a live tree means you&#x2019;re supporting a farmer&#x2019;s livelihood. Because Christmas trees are a commodity crop, they&#x2019;re grown on farms. Tree farmers harvest and replant each year to keep up with the demand for live trees.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-cons-of-buying-a-real-tree">Cons of Buying a Real Tree</h4>



<p>Live trees aren&#x2019;t perfect. While they&#x2019;re 100% biodegradable, live trees are often dumped in the trash once the season has passed. Those trees end up in landfills, which can prevent them from <a data-lasso-id="63655" href="https://brightly.eco/biodegradable-meaning/">properly biodegrading</a>. This contributes to increased greenhouse gas emissions.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-other-sustainable-tree-options">Other Sustainable Tree Options</h4>



<p>If you choose to buy a live tree, buy from a local farm. Minimize driving if possible, and participate in your area&#x2019;s tree-recycling efforts. Some cities recycle live trees and turn them into <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/26/business/energy-environment/fake-christmas-tree-vs-real-tree.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63656">mulch for the parks</a> or use the trees to combat beach erosion. No matter where you live, there should be a tree-recycling option near you.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Another sustainable tree option is renting. Some farms will rent a potted tree to you for the holiday season, which you can then return for replanting in January.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Lastly, consider other festive options such as a potted rosemary plant, a ladder tree, or a homemade tree from driftwood, books, or other materials around the house. These are cheerful, reusable options that are gentler on the environment.&#xA0;</p>



<h3 id="h-2-decorate-with-zero-waste-lights-and-ornaments">2. Decorate With Zero-Waste Lights and Ornaments</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt class="wp-image-9527" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/markus-spiske-Cg61E1gsLA-unsplash-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>In addition to a tree, there are many other festive decorations we tend to use during the holiday season. Here&#x2019;s how to make your other decor more sustainable, too.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-make-the-switch-to-led-lights">Make the Switch to LED Lights</h4>



<p>If your holiday lights are past their prime, buy LED lights instead of traditional incandescent lights. LED lights use about <a data-lasso-id="63658" href="https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/led-lighting#:~:text=Residential%20LEDs%20%2D%2D%20especially%20ENERGY,savings%20in%20the%20United%20States." target="_blank" rel="noopener">75% less energy </a>than incandescents, and they also last 25 times longer. That means you&#x2019;ll save on energy when you choose LED lights and have to replace them less frequently.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-turn-off-your-lights-and-use-a-timer">Turn Off Your Lights and Use a Timer</h4>



<p>Part of having an almost zero-waste holiday season is minimizing energy consumption. Holiday lights use a lot of energy, so turning them off before you go to bed will help. It&#x2019;s also good to turn off lights for safety reasons. According to the <a href="https://www.nfpa.org/Public-Education/Fire-causes-and-risks/Seasonal-fire-causes/Winter-holidays/Holiday-fires-by-the-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63659">National Fire Protection Association</a>, about half of home Christmas tree fires involved electrical or lighting equipment. And decorative lights started about 1 in 5 Christmas tree fires. </p>



<p>If you&#x2019;re worried about forgetting the lights, set up an automatic timer that will turn off the lights at a specific time. That way, you can sleep easy knowing you&#x2019;re saving energy and keeping your home safe.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-decorate-with-diy-ornaments">Decorate With DIY Ornaments&#xA0;</h4>



<p>Handmade, <a href="https://brightly.eco/diy-christmas-ornaments/" data-lasso-id="63856">DIY Christmas ornaments</a> are a unique and eco-friendly way to add a festive flair to your home. We particularly love <a data-lasso-id="63660" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIbfXsBhKwX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">natural options</a> such as <a data-lasso-id="63661" href="https://www.saltycanary.com/diy-old-fashioned-cranberry-popcorn-garland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cranberry and popcorn garlands</a>, <a data-lasso-id="63662" href="https://www.shekeepsalovelyhome.com/dried-citrus-christmas-ornaments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dried citrus ornaments</a>, and long-lasting <a data-lasso-id="63663" href="https://wholefully.com/make-salt-dough-ornaments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salt dough keepsakes</a>.&#xA0;Check out some of our other favorite DIY ornaments <a href="https://brightly.eco/diy-christmas-ornaments/" data-lasso-id="63857">here</a>. </p>



<p>One of Laura&#x2019;s holiday traditions is making outdoor ornaments for local wildlife. Her family would cover foraged pinecones in peanut butter before rolling them in birdseed and hanging them outside for the birds and squirrels. Another fun option is baked birdseed ornaments, which are extra pretty if you cut them out with holiday-themed cookie cutters.&#xA0;</p>



<h4 id="h-use-a-safe-alternative-to-flocked-snow">Use a Safe Alternative to Flocked Snow</h4>



<p>The flocked snow on your tree might look pretty, but <a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/ranking-christmas-decorations-by-how-terrible-they-are-for-the-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63666">it&#x2019;s not good for the environment or your health</a>. It&#x2019;s made from polystyrene, a known carcinogen that can take centuries to decompose.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Thankfully, there are safe, eco-friendly alternatives to polystyrene flocking. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIOKXXLnnTA/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63667">@francesivyrose</a> on Instagram has a great tutorial on flocking pinecones with just water, flour, and salt!</p>



<h3 id="h-3-wrap-your-holiday-gifts-in-zero-waste-alternatives">3. Wrap Your Holiday Gifts in Zero-Waste Alternatives</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1-1024x683.jpg" alt="silver scissors beside orange leather shoe" class="wp-image-47038" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/sclzndd-1hq-1.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>One of the easiest ways to make a sustainable choice this holiday season is to swap out your wrapping paper for a more <a href="https://brightly.eco/eco-friendly-gift-wrapping-ideas/" data-lasso-id="63858">eco-friendly wrapping paper</a> option. If every American family wrapped just three gifts in reusable materials, the paper saved would cover 45,000 football fields!</p>



<p>Some easy gift-wrap alternatives:</p>



<ul><li>Reusable fabric, like <a href="https://brightly.eco/furoshiki-gift-wrapping-technique/" data-lasso-id="63859">furoshiki</a></li><li>Leftover paper from last year (save paper each year for reuse!)</li><li>Post-consumer recycled wrapping paper&#xA0;</li><li>Newspaper or magazines </li><li>Interesting vessels, like mason jars or baskets</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-4-send-low-waste-holiday-cards">4. Send Low-Waste Holiday Cards</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/annie-spratt-ZeTlWEBzHHo-unsplash-1024x681.jpg" alt class="wp-image-9529" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/annie-spratt-ZeTlWEBzHHo-unsplash-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/annie-spratt-ZeTlWEBzHHo-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/annie-spratt-ZeTlWEBzHHo-unsplash-768x511.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/annie-spratt-ZeTlWEBzHHo-unsplash-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/annie-spratt-ZeTlWEBzHHo-unsplash-624x415.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightly.eco/environmental-impact-of-greeting-cards/" data-lasso-id="63860">Greeting cards</a> are a thoughtful way to stay in touch during the holiday season. If you choose to send them, buy cards made from recycled paper, like ones from <a data-lasso-id="63671" href="https://www.paperculture.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Culture</a>. Try to avoid cards with a foil, glossy, or glittery finish, as you can&#x2019;t put those in the recycling bin.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Another card company that we love is <a href="https://www.goodpaper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63672">Good Paper</a>, whose cards are fair trade and support artisans worldwide. You can usually find these cards at Whole Foods if you want to pick them up close to home.&#xA0;</p>



<p>Lastly, don&#x2019;t be afraid to reuse cards you love. Cut off the fronts of cards you&#x2019;ve received and send them as postcards! If there&#x2019;s writing on the back, you can glue a piece of recycled white paper on it to cover it up. You&#x2019;ll have a brand-new card in no time. </p>



<p>If you&#x2019;re still not sure where to begin, check out our list of <a href="https://brightly.eco/environmental-impact-of-greeting-cards/" data-lasso-id="63673">greeting card alternatives</a>! </p>



<h3 id="h-5-give-thoughtfully-to-avoid-returns">5. Give Thoughtfully to Avoid Returns</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt class="wp-image-9530" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/simona-sergi-9AosJc43_nQ-unsplash-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightly.eco/what-happens-to-returns/" data-lasso-id="63861">Returns</a> are a huge problem, with shoppers returning nearly <a data-lasso-id="63674" href="https://bestlifeonline.com/most-returned-christmas-presents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$90 billion worth of gifts</a> each holiday season.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.housebeautiful.com/uk/lifestyle/a29885958/most-returned-christmas-gifts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63676">most returned items</a> fall into three categories: clothing, kitchen items, and sweets. Clothing is hard to buy for others because of personal tastes and sizing, so opt for a gift card and a thoughtful note instead. For kitchenware, don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask the recipient if they already have what you plan to buy! It&#x2019;s better to ruin the surprise than give them something they have to return (and saddle them with the carbon footprint of shipping it back).&#xA0;</p>



<p>For sweets, we recommend buying longer-lasting food items like olive oil or spices. Be sure to buy single-origin ones, if possible, because the farmers are more likely to be fairly paid, and the items will be fresher. (Listen to <a data-lasso-id="2512" href="https://brightly.eco/burlap-and-barrel-single-origin-spices/">our podcast episode about the spice trade</a> to learn more!)</p>



<p>If you&#x2019;re still struggling to buy gifts for your loved ones, don&#x2019;t be afraid to ask people for wishlists! It&#x2019;s better to get an idea of what your friends and family are asking for rather than taking a guess. You can also give your family your wishlist to be sure you won&#x2019;t need to return any of the gifts you receive this year. </p>

			<p>We love <a href="https://brightly.eco/burger-king-opens-vegetarian-restaurant/" data-lasso-id="63786">celebrating companies</a> that are taking small steps toward a more sustainable future. While these big corporations aren&#x2019;t anywhere near perfect, it&#x2019;s our job as conscious consumers to let them know when they&#x2019;re making a difference&#x2014;and, of course, when they can do better.</p>



<p>This month, there have been eco moves across many different industries. We&#x2019;re looking at the first fully-automated vegan food factory, Colgate&#x2019;s move into <a href="https://brightly.eco/eco-friendly-oral-care-products/" data-lasso-id="63787">eco-friendly oral care products</a>, and <meta charset="utf-8"><a href="https://brightly.eco/most-sustainable-coffee-chain-ranking/" data-lasso-id="63788">Starbucks</a>&#x2018; plans to reduce its carbon emissions from dairy production. Even celebrities are promoting sustainability by backing an alternative form of <a href="https://brightly.eco/green-your-finances/" data-lasso-id="63789">eco-friendly banking</a>. </p>



<p>Let&#x2019;s encourage these companies to keep moving in the right direction. Because when they make eco-friendly changes, others will follow.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-companies-making-eco-friendly-changes"><meta charset="utf-8">6 Companies Making Eco-Friendly Changes</h2>



<h3>1. Starbucks</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8-1024x683.jpg" alt="starbucks carbon emissions" class="wp-image-47091" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/chlb47sc_o8.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Starbucks has been a leader in bringing dairy-free milk (including Oatly, one of the most popular <a href="https://brightly.eco/oat-milk-brands/" data-lasso-id="63790">oat milk brands</a>!), into mainstream cafes. But now, it&#x2019;s looking to make its dairy production more sustainable, too.</p>



<p>Starbucks announced <a data-lasso-id="63576" href="https://www.dairyreporter.com/Article/2021/11/18/Starbucks-partnering-with-Arla-on-sustainable-sourcing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a partnership with Arla Foods</a> to reduce its carbon emissions from dairy production. The beverage chain has a big goal: cutting emissions in half by 2030. Data shows around 22% of Starbucks&#x2019; overall emissions come from dairy, so if the popular <a href="https://brightly.eco/most-sustainable-coffee-chain-ranking/" data-lasso-id="63791">coffee chain</a> wants to reduce its emissions, making changes in dairy production is a great place to start.</p>



<p>Starbucks&#x2019; partnership with Arla Foods aims to create a detailed blueprint on how to best produce ethical, low-emission dairy. Currently, milk from Arla Foods has about half the carbon emissions of its competitors, <a data-lasso-id="63577" href="https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/11/22/Starbucks-and-Arla-talk-low-carbon-dairy-tie-up-Partnership-is-integral-to-sustainable-food-production" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Food Navigator</a>. </p>



<h3 id="h-2-nissan">2. Nissan</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw-1024x683.jpg" alt class="wp-image-47341" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/b2gmku2mgqw.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>Move over, Tesla&#x2014;Nissan is making moves in the electric car industry. Nissan just announced it&#x2019;s planning to invest a whopping <a data-lasso-id="63574" href="https://wgnradio.com/news/business-news/nissan-investing-in-electric-vehicles-battery-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$17 billion</a> over the next five years into electric car production and better batteries to support the vehicles. </p>



<p>But that&#x2019;s not all: The announcement also promised Nissan will be reducing overall carbon emissions at the factory level, and a team of over 3,000 engineers will be hired to lead the charge. </p>



<p>This isn&#x2019;t the first time Nissan has announced eco-friendly changes. Just a few months ago, the company launched a new way <a data-lasso-id="63575" href="https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/auto-components/nissan-develops-technology-to-halve-recycling-cost-of-rare-earths/85897525" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to produce batteries</a> for electric vehicles, which will make them easier to recycle and process.</p>



<h3>3. Growthwell Foods</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growthwell-goods.jpg" alt class="wp-image-47343" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growthwell-goods.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growthwell-goods-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growthwell-goods-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/growthwell-goods-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"><figcaption>Photo: Growthwell Foods</figcaption></figure>



<p>Growthwell Foods is making plant-based eating even easier in Southeast Asia. Located in Singapore, Growthwell Foods has announced the region&#x2019;s first-ever fully automated vegan meat factory. </p>



<p>According to <a data-lasso-id="63578" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/growthwell-foods_sginnovation-sustainability-plantbased-activity-6869547099038482433-nBmY/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company&#x2019;s LinkedIn</a>, the factory will handle manufacturing, production, and the freezing of both vegan meat and plant-based seafood. Because this facility is the first of its kind, it will operate as a sort of pilot project. Meaning if it goes well, other companies will likely follow suit.</p>



<p>The facility is expected to produce <a data-lasso-id="63579" href="https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/growthwell-foods-vegan-meat-research-centre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4,000 metric tons</a> of plant-based foods every year, with clean ingredients like algae and legumes already being tested. This could lead to a huge boost in Singapore&#x2019;s economy by allowing them to create their own foods domestically, instead of importing them. Doing so is also a great way to reduce carbon emissions.</p>



<h3>4. Colgate</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="870" height="580" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/colgate-recyclean-medium-toothbrush.jpg" alt class="wp-image-47027" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/colgate-recyclean-medium-toothbrush.jpg 870w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/colgate-recyclean-medium-toothbrush-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/colgate-recyclean-medium-toothbrush-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/colgate-recyclean-medium-toothbrush-624x416.jpg 624w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Colgate is one of the most popular oral care brands. First, it released its <a href="https://www.colgate.com/en-us/products/toothbrush/colgate-bamboo-charcoal-toothbrush" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63792">Bamboo Charcoal Toothbrush</a>, which features a bamboo handle. Now, a recycled plastic option is making headlines.</p>



<p>Colgate India recently launched the RecyClean Toothbrush, which features a handle made from recycled plastic and plant-derived bristles. While it&#x2019;s not yet available in the U.S., here&#x2019;s to hoping it enters the market soon. (And that non-recycled plastic toothbrushes get the same sustainable makeover!)</p>



<h3>5. Herbal Essences</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg-1024x683.jpg" alt="2 blue and black bottles" class="wp-image-47028" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/b7rsbici_gg.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>Starting January 2022, new haircare products from Herbal Essences will be made using a special <a data-lasso-id="63581" href="https://www.cosmeticsdesign.com/Article/2021/11/18/Herbal-Essences-implementing-Eastman-Renew-advanced-recycling-resin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly-discovered type of resin</a>, allowing the bottles to be more easily recycled. </p>



<p>Right now, a big problem with haircare products is that the bottles they come in are made from a <a href="https://brightly.eco/types-plastic-recycling/" data-lasso-id="63793">specific type of plastic</a> some cities can&#x2019;t properly recycle in their facilities. However, Herbal Essences says bottles made using this type of resin will be easier to recycle without compromising quality. </p>



<p>Herbal Essences says this is just one will it will be working toward its goal of reducing virgin plastics by 50% by 2025.</p>



<h3>6. Aspiration</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq-1024x683.jpg" alt="person using laptop computer holding card" class="wp-image-47029" width="870" height="580" srcset="https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq-300x200.jpg 300w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq-768x512.jpg 768w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq-624x416.jpg 624w, https://brightly.eco/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/q59hmzk38eq.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px"></figure>



<p>While this news didn&#x2019;t break in November, it&#x2019;s still worth mentioning. In August, <a href="http://www.aspiration.com/brightly" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63794">Aspiration</a> announced it has not only doubled its users to more than five million but also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/08/18/fintech-grows-greener-sustainability-focused-aspiration-lands-23-billion-deal-to-go-public-via-spac/?sh=131a4bfbad30" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="63795">landed a $2.3 billion deal</a> to go public. </p>



<p>The financial tech company, which is backed by celebrities like <meta charset="utf-8">Drake and Leonardo DiCaprio, <meta charset="utf-8">appeals to conscious consumers through its promises to plant trees and never financially back fossil fuels, unlike many other popular banks. In the past 12 months alone, Aspiration has planted 35 million trees thanks to its members&#x2019; support.</p>

      <description>Yes, it's true: You can make vegan bacon out of banana peels. Here's how to make banana peel bacon for your next weekend brunch.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="elementor-widget-container">
			<p>You can make bacon out of bananas&#x2014;a sentence we <em>never</em> thought we&#x2019;d type. But it&#x2019;s true! After tossing your banana in the blender for your morning smoothie, you can take that <a data-lasso-id="5101" href="https://brightly.eco/kitchen-counter-compost-bins/">compost-destined peel</a> and turn it into a plant-based version of one of America&#x2019;s most beloved breakfast meats.</p>



<p>We&#x2019;re not going to lie: Turning bananas into bacon almost seems as unlikely as turning water <a href="https://brightly.eco/sustainable-wine-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-popular/" data-lasso-id="5102">into wine</a> (still waiting on someone to make that how-to video). But we can&#x2019;t pass up a good <a href="https://brightly.eco/food-waste-landfill/" data-lasso-id="5103">food waste</a> hack. Plus it&#x2019;s a meat alternative, and <a href="https://brightly.eco/sustainable-diets/" data-lasso-id="5104">plant-based diets</a> have&#xA0;<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-lasso-id="5105">been shown</a>&#xA0;to be one of the best ways to lessen your environmental impact. </p>



<p>To walk us through the process is <a data-lasso-id="5106" href="https://www.instagram.com/girlswhoeat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jamie Koll</a>, the health coach behind <a data-lasso-id="5107" href="https://girlswhoeat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Girls Who Eat</a>. In a <a data-lasso-id="5108" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@wearegirlswhoeat/video/6956306557436988677?sender_device=pc&amp;sender_web_id=6945149381915346438&amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;is_copy_url=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TikTok video</a> that&#x2019;s garnered nearly four million views, she shares exactly how to go about making banana peel bacon.</p>

<p>&#x201C;I gave up eating red meat over a decade ago, so when I heard banana peels could mimic bacon, I needed to try it,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;This is also a great recipe to limit food waste.&#x201D;</p>



<p>We&#x2019;ve gotta admit: Koll makes the process of making banana peel bacon look pretty simple, and the final product <em>does</em> appear quite meat-like. She even goes as far to say that &#x201C;you might not even miss bacon after making these.&#x201D; Hard not to be intrigued, right? </p>



<p>Continue reading below for step-by-step instructions on how to make banana peel bacon. Who knows&#x2014;it might be exactly what your weekend brunch is missing.</p>

<p><em>Ingredients:</em></p>



<p>Organic banana<br>1 Tbsp coconut aminos<br>1 Tbsp maple syrup<br>1 tsp paprika<br>1 tsp salt<br>1 tsp garlic powder</p>



<p><em>Instructions:</em></p>



<p>1. The first step in making banana peel bacon is super easy: eat a banana. Enjoy it as is, make <a data-lasso-id="5119" href="https://brightly.eco/mug-recipes/">banana bread in a mug</a>, or combine it with <a href="https://brightly.eco/oat-milk-brands/" data-lasso-id="63713">oat milk</a> to make a smoothie. If you want to save it for another time, put it in an airtight container and freeze it.</p>



<p>2. Rinse your peel to wash away any potential germs or pesticide residue. Then, shred it into 3 to 4 pieces, which will serve as your &#x201C;bacon&#x201D; strips. You&#x2019;ll want to get as much banana off the peel as possible. To do this, take a spoon and scrape away at each strip. </p>



<p>3. To flavor your banana peels, combine the coconut aminos, maple syrup, paprika, garlic powder, and salt in a bowl and mix well.</p>



<p>4. Coat the banana peels with your mixture by either using a basting brush or combining it all in a bowl. </p>



<p>5. Take your spice-coated banana peel bacon strips and place them on the stove or in your air fryer. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes and enjoy!</p>
