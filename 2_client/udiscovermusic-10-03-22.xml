                          <p>Women Rock &#x2013; a projected devised by journalist and YouTuber Belgian Jasper, returns for its second incarnation to celebrate International Women&#x2019;s Day 2022 with a cover of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/dio/"><strong>Dio&#x2019;s</strong></a> classic song, &#x201C;We Rock&#x201D;&#x2019;.
</p><p>The project celebrates women in Metal and aims to inspire men and women of all ages and backgrounds by discussing issues, sharing advice, and celebrating experiences. You can watch the &#x201C;We Rock&#x201D; video below.</p>
<p>Jasper comments: &#x201C;After the overwhelming response on the Women Rock project in 2021, I wanted to take this project that celebrates Women in Metal to a different level in 2022. I had the idea for coordinating a collaboration cover of a Heavy Metal classic with only female artists in September 2021.
</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9zr1nE6Zok?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;allowfullscreen&quot; class=&quot;uD-YT-video&quot; name=&quot;YouTube Embed&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt></div>
<p>&#x201C;Quickly, I realized the Dio classic &#x201C;We Rock&#x201D; would be perfect for a statement on International Women&#x2019;s Day. I started reaching out to friends in the Metal world, but also reached out to artists I had never met. One by one, 16 artists from 4 continents and all subgenres of Metal joined the project. For 5 months, tracks were recorded remotely and sent to me to mix, master and edit video footage. The result is a vibrant collaboration featuring artists from both underground and established bands who all show that Women Rock!&#x201D;
</p><p>The original version of &#x201C;We Rock&#x201D; featured on Dio&#x2019;s second album, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/last-line-album-dio-metal/"><strong><em>The Last In Line</em></strong></a>, from 1984. The record connected with discerning metal fans the world over, highlighting the genre&#x2019;s continued crossover potential when it went Top 5 in the UK and smashed into the Top 30 of the Billboard 200 in the US, earning a platinum disc.

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
                          <p>Emerging country artist Layla Tucker has released a track and accompanying video for her striking cover of <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/merle-haggard-mama-tried-album/">Merle Haggard&#x2019;s</a></strong> classic ballad, &#x201C;Misery and Gin.&#x201D;
</p><p>Produced by country music veteran Keith Thomas, &#x201C;Misery and Gin&#x201D; showcases the rising 22-year-old singer-songwriter&#x2019;s exquisite vocal ability and remarkable interpretation skills. After listening, it&#x2019;s clear why she was chosen as CMT Music&#x2019;s Next Up Now Artist of the Month for March.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTwiY7v2F-g?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JTwiY7v2F-g?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>As the daughter of legendary country music icon <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/tanya-tucker-best-songs/">Tanya Tucker</a></strong> and renowned songwriter Jerry Lasseter, Layla&#x2019;s connection to Merle Haggard is a deeply personal one. The country music giant was a close family friend who inspired Layla to work hard, find her voice and blaze her own musical trail.
</p><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s shocking how many people I&#x2019;ve met throughout the years who don&#x2019;t know who Merle Haggard is,&#x201D; Layla said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s been a really cool experience getting to record this song, like so many others, his music changed my life.&#x201D;
</p><p>&#x201C;Misery and Gin&#x201D; is a stunning introduction for the Tennessee native. Layla&#x2019;s vocals inform Haggard&#x2019;s melancholy 1980 hit with equal parts reverence and attitude, a restrained, entrancing performance that reveals an artistic sophistication well beyond her years. The accompanying music video, directed by Casey Pierce and shot at The Underdog bar in Nashville, beautifully captures the song&#x2019;s essential loneliness as the camera encircles Layla at the same table, singing the song night after night.
</p><p>Expressing conviction and heartache, Layla&#x2019;s performance flips the song&#x2019;s rugged, western male archetype to a women&#x2019;s perspective. As a teenager, Layla remembers how she rebelled against country music and pushed it out of her life. But when she was around 15 years old, the family moved to a new house in tiny Thompson&#x2019;s Station, Tennessee, and country music served as a solace for her loneliness.
</p><p>&#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t have any friends because we just moved out there, so all I really had was my dog, my record player and my guitar,&#x201D; she remembers. &#x201C;I could hook my phone up and I would sit in my room next to my window with my ear up to the speaker. That&#x2019;s where I fell in love with country music again because it was kind of my only friend at the time. One of the first songs that really changed how I felt about country music was one of Merle&#x2019;s.&#x201D;

                          <p>Grace Potter, Warren Haynes, Ivan Neville, Jamey Johnson, and others will pay tribute to <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-band/"><strong>The Band</strong></a>&#x2019;s final concert during a special performance at this year&#x2019;s Jazzfest. The Last Waltz New Orleans: A Celebration of the 45th Anniversary of the Band&#x2019;s Historic Farewell Concert will take place at the Big Easy&#x2019;s historic Saenger Theatre on May 7.
</p><p>Other participating artists include George Porter Jr., Don Was, Dave Malone, John Medeski, Cyril Neville, Terence Higgins, Bob Margolin, and Mark Mullins &amp; The Levee Horns. Tickets for the event go on sale on March 14 via Ticketmaster, with options for VIP packages available.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving of 1976, Canadian-American rock band, The Band, played their final show in San Francisco. The performance, famously known as &#x201C;The Last Waltz,&#x201D; featured a number of popular singer-songwriters as special guests, including <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/bob-dylan/">Bob Dylan</a></strong>, Joni Mitchell, Mavis Staples, and many more. Given its historic nature, the event was filmed by Martin Scorsese, and was eventually released as a documentary (titled <em>The Last Waltz</em>) in 1978. Decades later, <em>The Last Waltz</em> has maintained cultural relevance, and was added to the Library of Congress&#x2019; National Film Registry in 2019.
</p><p>The Last Waltz New Orleans: A Celebration of the 45th Anniversary of the Band&#x2019;s Historic Farewell Concert was organized by Keith Wortman, Robbie Robertson, Sebastian Robertson, and Blackbird Presents. The newest Jazzfest iteration is a continuation of Blackbird Presents&#x2019; annual The Last Waltz tour each November, which included a Nashville version, as well as a 2016 two-night event in NOLA for the concert&#x2019;s 40th anniversary.
</p><p>&#x201C;New Orleans has always felt like a second home to me musically and spiritually,&#x201D; Robbie Robertson, The Band&#x2019;s lead guitarist, said in a statement. &#x201C;I am honored to have this extraordinary lineup of musicians celebrate the tradition of The Last Waltz in one of my favorite cities.&#x201D;

                          <p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/best-erykah-badu-songs/">Erykah Badu</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/robert-glasper/">Robert Glasper</a></strong> with special guest Terrace Martin, and Gary Clark Jr. will headline Music at the Intersection, taking place in St. Louis September 10-11.
</p><p>The R&amp;B, jazz, and blues icons are joined on the festival&#x2019;s second-year lineup by international indie soul group Hiatus Kaiyote, blues guitarist Buddy Guy, jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington, soul-rock band JJ Grey &amp; Mofro, and St. Louis-bred alternative rock group The Urge, among others.</p>
<p>During the weekend, more than 50 national, regional, and local acts are scheduled to perform across four stages throughout Grand Center Arts District&#x2019;s outdoor festival footprint &#x2013; a mix of urban streets and green spaces, stretching across Washington Avenue, just east of Grand Blvd. Tickets go on sale at MetroTix on Friday, March 11, at 10 a.m., and limited quantity early bird prices start at $129 for all-weekend access or $69 for a day-pass. GA+ and VIP options are also available.
</p><p>&#x201C;Every year our aim is to make this festival more accessible, diverse and multi-dimensional,&#x201D; said Chris Hansen, executive director of Kranzberg Arts Foundation. &#x201C;In addition to the blues, jazz and heritage genre, which was the core of our lineup last year, we have national to local acts across everything from hip hop and R&amp;B to indie rock, soul and funk. Between acts, attendees can wander the festival&#x2019;s new outdoor footprint and enjoy local food offerings, unique amusements, live art activations and shopping with local vendors. An attendee may buy a ticket with a favorite like Erykah Badu, Buddy Guy or The Urge, in mind, but that ticket gets them access to an incredible, dynamic urban music experience &#x2013; and we hope they explore it all.&#x201D;
</p><p>Festival grounds open at 11 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday, September 10-11, and performances will take place within that outdoor footprint until well after sunset.
</p><p>Throughout the weekend, Grand Center&#x2019;s world-class partner venues &#x2013; including The Fabulous Fox, The Sheldon Concert Hall, The Grandel Theater and Jazz St Louis &#x2013; will open their doors for official festival pre and after party concerts.

                          <p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/glass-animals-sigrid-munich-superbloom-festival/">Sigrid</a></strong> has shared a brand new single &#x201C;It Gets Dark.&#x201D; The single is the latest to be taken from the Norwegian pop icon&#x2019;s upcoming second album, which has yet to be announced.
</p><p>&#x201C;I believe you need to feel the lows in life to feel the highs, and you have to know what sucks to then properly appreciate the good stuff,&#x201D; the singer said in a press statement. &#x201C;&#x2018;It Gets Dark&#x2019; is an ode to that. I honestly don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever been as excited about a single release before.&#x201D;</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="lazy lazy-hidden" data-lazy-type="iframe" data-lazy-src="&lt;iframe src=&apos;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLXo_AuuXI8?rel=0&apos; name=&apos;YouTube Embed&apos; frameborder=&apos;0&apos; allow=&apos;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&apos; allowfullscreen class=&apos;uD-YT-video&apos;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;" alt><iframe name="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sLXo_AuuXI8?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div>
<p>The track was premiered on Clara Amfo&#x2019;s BBC Radio 1 show as the Hottest Record In The World. &#x201C;I think when we wrote &#x2018;It Gets Dark&#x2019; I didn&#x2019;t know what my second album was going to sound like and then when I heard that intro, that&#x2019;s when I knew: &#x2018;This is it &#x2013; this is the sound&#x2019;,&#x201D; Sigrid explained. &#x201C;So it&#x2019;s been the leading star for the whole new era.&#x201D;
</p><p>The new song comes after a busy 2021 for Sigrid.&#xA0;The acclaimed pop star released a handful of singles &#x2013;&#xA0;<strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sigrid-mirror/">&#x201C;Mirror&#x201D;</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sigrid-burning-bridges/">&#x201C;Burning Bridges&#x201D;</a></strong> &#x2013;&#xA0;which are also expected to appear on the follow-up to her 2019 debut album <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sigrid-tour-sucker-punch-album/"><em>Sucker Punch</em></a></strong>. She also put in euphoric performances at festivals across the summer, including sets on the main stages at Reading &amp; Leeds.
</p><p>Sigrid recently teamed up with Griff for the electrifying collaborative single <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sigrid-griff-head-on-fire/">&#x201C;Head On Fire,&#x201D;</a></strong> which the Norwegian star said was about &#x201C;that feeling when you meet someone who just flips everything upside down and you can&#x2019;t focus on anything else but that person.&#x201D;
</p><p>Meanwhile, in December, Sigrid teased a new track called <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sigrid-new-track-gets-dark/">&#x201C;It Gets Dark&#x201D;</a></strong> in an Instagram post reflecting on the last 12 months. &#x201C;But next year will be even better. We have some very special things coming. See you in 2022,&#x201D; she said as a new track played in the background.

</p><p>Franco&#x2019;s music for <em>Encanto</em> took the award for outstanding original score for a studio film, beating out scores for <em>Dune</em> and <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, among others, in the balloting.</p>
<p>During her acceptance speech, Franco asked all the women composers to stand up as she honored her fellow colleagues in celebration of International Women&#x2019;s Day.
</p><p>Billie Eilish&#x2019;s Bond theme won outstanding original song for a drama or documentary, while &#x201C;Just Look Up&#x201D; &#x2014; by Ariana Grande, Nicholas Britell, Kid Cudi and Taura Stinson, from <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ariana-grande-kid-cudi-just-look-up-official-release/"><em>Don&#x2019;t Look Up</em></a></strong> &#x2014; won in the category of original song for a musical or comedy.
</p><p>Eilish and O&#x2019;Connell sent a video message thanking SCL and noting how proud they were to be recognized by &#x201C;some of the great composers and lyricists of our time.&#x201D;
</p><p>Eilish is currently on her <i>Happier&#xA0;Than Ever</i> world tour.&#xA0;In a recently shared <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/billie-eilish-happier-than-ever-world-tour-behind-the-scenes/">long-form video</a></strong>, the singer and songwriter documented the lead up to the <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/billie-eilish-happier-than-ever-release/"><strong><em>Happier Than Ever</em></strong></a> world tour beginning with the two days before its opening night in New Orleans at the Smoothie King Center (February 3).
</p><p>The video goes in-depth on Eilish&#x2019;s pre-tour process, playing through a full run of the show to an empty arena to make note of any changes she would like to implement. Throughout her career, the musician has long been heavily involved in the visual depiction of her music, going so far as to direct her own music videos to maintain creative control of her vision. In the tour visual, she makes tweaks to certain lighting cues and stage positionings to increase the quality of the show.
</p><p>At multiple moments, Eilish notes ways in which the experience could be elevated for the fans watching, even making her way to the farthest back row of the New Orleans venue to see what the show would look like to fans sitting in the nosebleeds. The setlist for the tour, revealed in full in the video with notes of stage transitions, pulls together music from <em>Happier Than Ever</em>; <em>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</em>; and her earliest EPs and one-off singles which featured songs like &#x201C;Bellyache,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ocean Eyes,&#x201D; &#x201C;Bored,&#x201D; and more.

                          <p><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/taylor-swift/"><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/billie-eilish/">Billie Eilish</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/justin-bieber/">Justin Bieber</a></strong> lead the music nominations at the 35th annual Nickelodeon Kids&#x2019; Choice Awards. The award show, which allows kids to vote on their favorites in music, film, and TV, airs April 9 on Nickelodeon. Actress Miranda Cosgrove and Football champion Rob Gronkowski will serve as co-hosts.
</p><p>&#x201C;Nickelodeon&#x2019;s Kids&#x2019; Choice Awards has always been such a unique show with tons of energy, superstars and of course, lots of slime,&#x201D; Cosgrove said in a statement. &#x201C;Nickelodeon has always been my family and to co-host this iconic show alongside Gronk will be a blast.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Swift tops with four nominations, including twice in the category of Favorite Album (for <em>Fearless (Taylor&#x2019;s Version)</em> and <em>Red (Taylor&#x2019;s Version)</em>). She is also nominated for Favorite Female Artist and Favorite Song for &#x201C;All Too Well (Taylor&#x2019;s Version).&#x201D; The song appears on <em>Red (Taylor&#x2019;s Version),</em> the second of Swift&#x2019;s re-recordings that was released in November. Eilish follows with three nominations in the above categories, including for the title track of her latest album, &#x201C;Happier Than Ever.&#x201D; Eilish&#x2019;s sophomore record marks the pop performer&#x2019;s second No.1 album on the Billboard 200.
</p><p>Tying with Eilish, Bieber has nominations in three categories, including Favorite Male Artist, Favorite Album (<em>Justice</em>), and Favorite Collaboration for &#x201C;STAY&#x201D; with The Kid LAROI. <em>Justice</em>, which marks his sixth studio album, was a No.1 hit for Bieber in the US and Canada, following its release in March 2021.
</p><p>Other notable nominees for Favorite Album include <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/drake-album-certified-lover-boy-out/"><strong>Drake&#x2019;s <em>Certified Lover Boy</em> </strong></a>and Adele&#x2019;s <em>30</em>, while BTS are up for Favorite Global Music Star and Favorite Music Group, alongside <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/black-eyed-peas/">Black Eyed Peas</a></strong>, Jonas Brothers, Migos, Florida Georgia Line, and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/maroon-5/"><strong>Maroon 5</strong></a>.

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
                          <p>The brilliant and beloved cornetist, composer, bandleader, and educator <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ron-miles-queen-of-the-south/">Ron Miles</a></strong> passed away last night at his home in Denver, Colorado. His death was confirmed by his manager and producer Hans Wendl. The cause was complications from Polycythemia Vera, a rare blood disorder. He was 58 years old.
</p><p>Ron is survived by his wife Kari Miles, daughter Justice Miles, son Honor Miles, mother Jane Miles, brother Johnathan Miles, sisters Shari Miles-Cohen and Kelly West, and half-sister Vicki M. Brown.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ron was such a gifted artist,&#x201D; said Blue Note President Don Was. &#x201C;He was a sweet, soulful man whose character was reflected in every exquisite note he played. We are heartbroken to lose him so soon, but he will live forever through the music he&#x2019;s left behind for us.&#x201D;
</p><p>Ron was born on May 9, 1963, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and moved with his family to Denver when he was 11 years old. Soon after he began playing trumpet and studied both classical and jazz. He went on to study music at the University of Denver, University of Colorado Boulder, and the Manhattan School of Music. In 1987, Ron released Distance for Safety, the first of a dozen albums he would make over the next 35 years including such critically acclaimed works as <em>Heaven</em> (2002), <em>Quiver</em> (2012), and <em>I Am A Man</em> (2017). Ron received a GRAMMY nomination for his performance on <strong><a href="https://www.joshuaredman.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joshua Redman&#x2019;s</a></strong> 2018 album <em>Still Dreaming</em>.
</p><p>Ron&#x2019;s final album was his Blue Note Records debut, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ron-miles-rainbow-sign-blue-note/"><em>Rainbow Sign</em></a></strong>, which was released in 2020 and featured a quintet with some of his most frequent collaborators: guitarist Bill Frisell, pianist Jason Moran, bassist Thomas Morgan, and drummer Brian Blade. Written in tribute to Ron&#x2019;s father Fay Dooney Miles, who had passed away in 2018, <em>JazzTimes</em> called it &#x201C;spiritually powerful,&#x201D; while <em>DownBeat</em> said it was &#x201C;a deeply touching album&#x201D; and &#x201C;by far Miles&#x2019; most impressive work as a bandleader.&#x201D;
</p><p>As a Professor of Music at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, Ron also led a distinguished and lengthy career in music education where he had taught since the late 1990s.

        <![CDATA[<div id="mvp-content-main" class="left relative">
                          <p><em>Dance Fever</em>, the fifth album from <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/florence-and-the-machine/"><strong>Florence + the Machine</strong></a>, is set for release on May 13. As a taster, the band&#x2019;s new single &#x201C;My Love&#x201D; debuts today alongside a video by acclaimed director Autumn de Wilde. You can check the video out below.
</p><p><em>Dance Fever</em> was recorded in London over the course of the pandemic in anticipation of the world&#x2019;s reopening. It conjures up what Florence missed most in the midst of lockdown&#x2014;clubs, dancing at festivals, being in the whirl of movement and togetherness&#x2014;and the hope of reunions to come.</p>
<p>Just before the pandemic Florence had become fascinated by choreomania, a Renaissance phenomenon in which groups of people&#x2014;sometimes thousands&#x2014;danced wildly to the point of exhaustion, collapse and death. The imagery resonated with Florence, who had been touring nonstop for more than a decade, and in lockdown felt oddly prescient.
</p><p>The image and concept of dance, and choreomania, remained central as Florence wove her own experiences of dance&#x2014;a discipline she turned to in the early days of sobriety&#x2014;with the folkloric elements of a moral panic from the Middle Ages. In recent times of torpor and confinement, dance offered propulsion, energy and a way of looking at music more choreographically.

<p>Starting, as ever, armed with a notebook of poems and ideas, Florence had just arrived to New York in March 2020 to begin recording when Covid-19 forced a retreat to London. Holed up at home, the songs began to transform, with nods to dance, folk, &#x2018;70s <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/iggy-pop/"><strong>Iggy Pop</strong></a>, longing-for-the-road folk tracks a la <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/lucinda-williams/"><strong>Lucinda Williams</strong></a> or Emmylou Harris and more, ultimately arriving somewhere that Florence describes as &#x201C;Nick Cave at the club.&#x201D;
</p><p>Lyrically, she took inspiration from the tragic heroines of pre-Raphaelite art, the gothic fiction of Carmen Maria Machado and Julia Armfield, the visceral wave of folk horror film from <em>The Wicker Man</em> and <em>The Witch</em> to <em>Midsommar</em>.
</p><p><em>Dance Fever</em> is an album that sees Florence at the peak of her powers, coming into a fully realized self-knowledge, poking sly fun at her own self-created persona, playing with ideas of identity, masculinity and femininity, redemption and celebration.
</p><p>&#x201C;My Love&#x201D; follows the recently released &#x201C;King&#x201D; and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/florence-machine-new-song-heaven-here/"><strong>&#x201C;Heaven is Here,&#x201D;</strong></a> both of which arrived alongside videos by de Wilde choreographed by Ryan Heffington. Dance Fever was produced by Florence, Jack Antonoff and Dave Bayley of Glass Animals.
