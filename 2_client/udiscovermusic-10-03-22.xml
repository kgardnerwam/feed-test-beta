                          <p>Grace Potter, Warren Haynes, Ivan Neville, Jamey Johnson, and others will pay tribute to <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-band/"><strong>The Band</strong></a>&#x2019;s final concert during a special performance at this year&#x2019;s Jazzfest. The Last Waltz New Orleans: A Celebration of the 45th Anniversary of the Band&#x2019;s Historic Farewell Concert will take place at the Big Easy&#x2019;s historic Saenger Theatre on May 7.
</p><p>Other participating artists include George Porter Jr., Don Was, Dave Malone, John Medeski, Cyril Neville, Terence Higgins, Bob Margolin, and Mark Mullins &amp; The Levee Horns. Tickets for the event go on sale on March 14 via Ticketmaster, with options for VIP packages available.</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving of 1976, Canadian-American rock band, The Band, played their final show in San Francisco. The performance, famously known as &#x201C;The Last Waltz,&#x201D; featured a number of popular singer-songwriters as special guests, including <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/bob-dylan/">Bob Dylan</a></strong>, Joni Mitchell, Mavis Staples, and many more. Given its historic nature, the event was filmed by Martin Scorsese, and was eventually released as a documentary (titled <em>The Last Waltz</em>) in 1978. Decades later, <em>The Last Waltz</em> has maintained cultural relevance, and was added to the Library of Congress&#x2019; National Film Registry in 2019.
</p><p>The Last Waltz New Orleans: A Celebration of the 45th Anniversary of the Band&#x2019;s Historic Farewell Concert was organized by Keith Wortman, Robbie Robertson, Sebastian Robertson, and Blackbird Presents. The newest Jazzfest iteration is a continuation of Blackbird Presents&#x2019; annual The Last Waltz tour each November, which included a Nashville version, as well as a 2016 two-night event in NOLA for the concert&#x2019;s 40th anniversary.
</p><p>&#x201C;New Orleans has always felt like a second home to me musically and spiritually,&#x201D; Robbie Robertson, The Band&#x2019;s lead guitarist, said in a statement. &#x201C;I am honored to have this extraordinary lineup of musicians celebrate the tradition of The Last Waltz in one of my favorite cities.&#x201D;

                          <p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/best-erykah-badu-songs/">Erykah Badu</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/robert-glasper/">Robert Glasper</a></strong> with special guest Terrace Martin, and Gary Clark Jr. will headline Music at the Intersection, taking place in St. Louis September 10-11.
</p><p>The R&amp;B, jazz, and blues icons are joined on the festival&#x2019;s second-year lineup by international indie soul group Hiatus Kaiyote, blues guitarist Buddy Guy, jazz saxophonist Kamasi Washington, soul-rock band JJ Grey &amp; Mofro, and St. Louis-bred alternative rock group The Urge, among others.</p>
<p>During the weekend, more than 50 national, regional, and local acts are scheduled to perform across four stages throughout Grand Center Arts District&#x2019;s outdoor festival footprint &#x2013; a mix of urban streets and green spaces, stretching across Washington Avenue, just east of Grand Blvd. Tickets go on sale at MetroTix on Friday, March 11, at 10 a.m., and limited quantity early bird prices start at $129 for all-weekend access or $69 for a day-pass. GA+ and VIP options are also available.
</p><p>&#x201C;Every year our aim is to make this festival more accessible, diverse and multi-dimensional,&#x201D; said Chris Hansen, executive director of Kranzberg Arts Foundation. &#x201C;In addition to the blues, jazz and heritage genre, which was the core of our lineup last year, we have national to local acts across everything from hip hop and R&amp;B to indie rock, soul and funk. Between acts, attendees can wander the festival&#x2019;s new outdoor footprint and enjoy local food offerings, unique amusements, live art activations and shopping with local vendors. An attendee may buy a ticket with a favorite like Erykah Badu, Buddy Guy or The Urge, in mind, but that ticket gets them access to an incredible, dynamic urban music experience &#x2013; and we hope they explore it all.&#x201D;
</p><p>Festival grounds open at 11 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday, September 10-11, and performances will take place within that outdoor footprint until well after sunset.
</p><p>Throughout the weekend, Grand Center&#x2019;s world-class partner venues &#x2013; including The Fabulous Fox, The Sheldon Concert Hall, The Grandel Theater and Jazz St Louis &#x2013; will open their doors for official festival pre and after party concerts. Lineups and ticketing details for those events will be announced at a later date.

</p><p>Franco&#x2019;s music for <em>Encanto</em> took the award for outstanding original score for a studio film, beating out scores for <em>Dune</em> and <em>The Power of the Dog</em>, among others, in the balloting.</p>
<p>During her acceptance speech, Franco asked all the women composers to stand up as she honored her fellow colleagues in celebration of International Women&#x2019;s Day.
</p><p>Billie Eilish&#x2019;s Bond theme won outstanding original song for a drama or documentary, while &#x201C;Just Look Up&#x201D; &#x2014; by Ariana Grande, Nicholas Britell, Kid Cudi and Taura Stinson, from <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ariana-grande-kid-cudi-just-look-up-official-release/"><em>Don&#x2019;t Look Up</em></a></strong> &#x2014; won in the category of original song for a musical or comedy.
</p><p>Eilish and O&#x2019;Connell sent a video message thanking SCL and noting how proud they were to be recognized by &#x201C;some of the great composers and lyricists of our time.&#x201D;
</p><p>Eilish is currently on her <i>Happier&#xA0;Than Ever</i> world tour.&#xA0;In a recently shared <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/billie-eilish-happier-than-ever-world-tour-behind-the-scenes/">long-form video</a></strong>, the singer and songwriter documented the lead up to the <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/billie-eilish-happier-than-ever-release/"><strong><em>Happier Than Ever</em></strong></a> world tour beginning with the two days before its opening night in New Orleans at the Smoothie King Center (February 3).
</p><p>The video goes in-depth on Eilish&#x2019;s pre-tour process, playing through a full run of the show to an empty arena to make note of any changes she would like to implement. Throughout her career, the musician has long been heavily involved in the visual depiction of her music, going so far as to direct her own music videos to maintain creative control of her vision. In the tour visual, she makes tweaks to certain lighting cues and stage positionings to increase the quality of the show.
</p><p>At multiple moments, Eilish notes ways in which the experience could be elevated for the fans watching, even making her way to the farthest back row of the New Orleans venue to see what the show would look like to fans sitting in the nosebleeds. The setlist for the tour, revealed in full in the video with notes of stage transitions, pulls together music from <em>Happier Than Ever</em>; <em>When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?</em>; and her earliest EPs and one-off singles which featured songs like &#x201C;Bellyache,&#x201D; &#x201C;Ocean Eyes,&#x201D; &#x201C;Bored,&#x201D; and more.

                          <p>The brilliant and beloved cornetist, composer, bandleader, and educator <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ron-miles-queen-of-the-south/">Ron Miles</a></strong> passed away last night at his home in Denver, Colorado. His death was confirmed by his manager and producer Hans Wendl. The cause was complications from Polycythemia Vera, a rare blood disorder. He was 58 years old.
</p><p>Ron is survived by his wife Kari Miles, daughter Justice Miles, son Honor Miles, mother Jane Miles, brother Johnathan Miles, sisters Shari Miles-Cohen and Kelly West, and half-sister Vicki M. Brown.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Ron was such a gifted artist,&#x201D; said Blue Note President Don Was. &#x201C;He was a sweet, soulful man whose character was reflected in every exquisite note he played. We are heartbroken to lose him so soon, but he will live forever through the music he&#x2019;s left behind for us.&#x201D;
</p><p>Ron was born on May 9, 1963, in Indianapolis, Indiana, and moved with his family to Denver when he was 11 years old. Soon after he began playing trumpet and studied both classical and jazz. He went on to study music at the University of Denver, University of Colorado Boulder, and the Manhattan School of Music. In 1987, Ron released Distance for Safety, the first of a dozen albums he would make over the next 35 years including such critically acclaimed works as <em>Heaven</em> (2002), <em>Quiver</em> (2012), and <em>I Am A Man</em> (2017). Ron received a GRAMMY nomination for his performance on <strong><a href="https://www.joshuaredman.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Joshua Redman&#x2019;s</a></strong> 2018 album <em>Still Dreaming</em>.
</p><p>Ron&#x2019;s final album was his Blue Note Records debut, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ron-miles-rainbow-sign-blue-note/"><em>Rainbow Sign</em></a></strong>, which was released in 2020 and featured a quintet with some of his most frequent collaborators: guitarist Bill Frisell, pianist Jason Moran, bassist Thomas Morgan, and drummer Brian Blade. Written in tribute to Ron&#x2019;s father Fay Dooney Miles, who had passed away in 2018, <em>JazzTimes</em> called it &#x201C;spiritually powerful,&#x201D; while <em>DownBeat</em> said it was &#x201C;a deeply touching album&#x201D; and &#x201C;by far Miles&#x2019; most impressive work as a bandleader.&#x201D;
</p><p>As a Professor of Music at the Metropolitan State University of Denver, Ron also led a distinguished and lengthy career in music education where he had taught since the late 1990s.
