        <![CDATA[<p>Happy trade deadline week!</p>

<p>With the NBA calendar back to normal, the last day teams can make trades this season is Thursday, Feb. 10. The cutoff point is 3:00 p.m., but it's not unusual for some trades to be reported shortly after the deadline.</p>

<p>There is never a shortage of rumors heading into the trade deadline, this season being no exception. The 76ers still haven't found a new home for Ben Simmons, it was reported early in the season that Myles Turner and Domantas Sabonis are available, there's no shortage of interest in Jerami Grant and Goran Dragic is one of many veterans who could be on the move.</p>

<p>With that in mind, four members of our TSN staff share the one deal they'd like to see go down on Thursday's trade deadline.</p>

<h2>Myles Turner to the Queen City</h2>

<p>The Hornets are a&nbsp;fun and competitive team as is, but if there's one position&nbsp;they're lacking, it's at center.</p>

<p>Enter: Myles Turner.</p>

<p>It's well known that Turner is available, and Indiana's asking price is said to include two first-round picks. Him being sidelined with a stress reaction in his left foot is a little scary — nothing sets off the alarm bells quite like a 7-footer with a foot problem — but assuming he returns to full strength, he's the perfect type of center for these up-and-coming&nbsp;Hornets.</p>

<p>Defensively, Turner would give Charlotte&nbsp;a legitimate defensive anchor who can protect the rim at a high level. (This is your reminder that Turner is on pace to lead the league in blocks for the third time in his career this season. The Hornets could do with that type of presence.)&nbsp;Offensively, he'd provide some valuable floor spacing at the five, and playing next to a pass-first point guard in LaMelo Ball could help him grow into the role he's looking for.</p>

<p>It wouldn't be all that difficult for the Hornets to put together a package for Turner, who is on the books for $18.0 million this season. Kelly Oubre Jr. ($12.0 million) gets them close to Turner's number,&nbsp;and the Hornets could sweeten any deal with draft capital and/or one of their young prospects, such as Kai Jones, James Bouknight or P.J. Washington.</p>

<p>I don't claim to be a trade machine expert, but does this get the stamp of approval from both the Hornets and Pacers?</p>

<p><img alt="Myles Turner to Hornets" perform:prop="uuid:uz4ydhwk8a0w1he73az5jgwkl;width:2518;height:802" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/6e/a4/myles-turner-to-hornets_6t2mj34n2fr51lpsk9yyk9x76.png?t=-1132492594" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" /></p>

<p><em>— Scott Rafferty (@crabdribbles)</em></p>

<h2>The path to Luka Doncic's sidekick?</h2>

<p>How are the Mavericks going to find a no. 2 good enough to pair with Luka Doncic?</p>

<p>This is the question that they have to be asking themselves. They have an option of locking up their future roster by re-signing Dorian Finney-Smith and Jalen Brunson this summer. But that’s the team going forward, barring trades. They’ll be in the tax and financially locked up. That’s probably not good enough to be a true contender. They need to move Brunson if they want an upgrade.</p>

<p><img alt="Jalen Brunson to the Knicks" perform:prop="uuid:14z2zvlxu3ohk179hqh44pym98;width:2560;height:1198" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/sporting_news/e3/26/jalen-brunson-to-the-knicks_6p5d2s91rlzo1a5w0z927ha5e.png?t=-1057300210" style="height: 100%; width: 100%;" /></p>

<p>This package for Brunson might seem kind of meh at first, but here’s the key: The Knicks currently own the Mavericks’ 2023 first-round pick, which is top-10 protected through 2025. Because of the NBA’s Stepien rule and the uncertainty as to when that pick will actually convey, the Mavericks are severely limited in which first-round picks they can trade out.</p>

<p>In short, if a no. 2 type of player does become available in the trade market, then it becomes a lot easier for the Mavericks to put a package together if they get their pick back from the Knicks.</p>

<p>The Knicks have been rumored to be in love with Brunson. Immanuel Quickley is a nice player too, but Brunson is a lot better. The two second-round picks are a throw-in to help the Mavericks with that future star trade. The Knicks have two second-rounders in both of those years, so they’re not missing out on much. This is a win-win trade for both teams.</p>

<p><em>— Steph&nbsp;Noh (@StephNoh)</em></p>

<h2>Kings and Pacers swap young stars</h2>



<p>I love everything about this deal for both sides (and of course I do, I'm the one that created it). The Pacers have been stuck in mediocrity for years now and the Kings haven't made the playoffs in over 15 years – the longest active playoff drought in the NBA. Both teams have some intriguing young pieces but nothing is clicking, and it's time for both franchises to move on and get some new life in their respective locker rooms.</p>

<p>Trading De'Aaron Fox allows the Kings to start fresh, building around future star Tyrese Haliburton. He and Domantas Sabonis would create a terrorizing dual-threat on offense as both players are more than capable of creating for themselves and others.</p>

<p>The Kings also receive the prolific scoring T.J. Warren in the deal, who has only played in four games since his outburst in the NBA bubble due to a foot injury, but he would give them a scoring boost once he's healthy. Jeremy Lamb, who is on an expiring deal, is only there to make the money work, while Sacramento would have to give up the more favorable 2023 first-rounder in a pick swap because Sabonis is the best player dealt.</p>

<p>For the Pacers, they get an electrifying point guard in Fox who might just be a change of scenery away from reaching his All-Star potential. He could fit in nicely next to Malcolm Brogdon, and Harrison Barnes would replace Warren's scoring threat, which, as I mentioned, has been absent since 2020.</p>

<p>The more favorable 2023 first-rounder is the icing on the cake to send the deal through.</p>

<p><em>– Kyle Irving (<a href="twitter.com/kyleirv_">@KyleIrv_</a>)</em></p>

<h2>The Spurs and Raptors make a deal, again</h2>

<p>To the surprise of very few, the Raptors are a pain to deal with this season and, as a result, are putting themselves in a position to make a respectable playoff run. In order to do so, they'll need to bolster their frontcourt and get a little more from their second unit. The Spurs have both of the answers:</p>



<p>Considered by some as an "add-on" when he was traded from the Raptors to the Spurs, Jakob Poeltl is the centerpiece of this deal. He returns to Toronto, where he began his career in the same rookie class as Pascal Siakam and Fred VanVleet.</p>

<p>In Thaddeus Young, the Raptors get a proven veteran who is the perfect player for the system. The 15-year veteran is 6-foot-8, can defend, pass, rebound and is extremely cerebral.</p>

<p>The Spurs take on the expiring contracts of Goran Dragic and Chris Boucher, which provide potential cap relief for a team that's building for the future and will need to pay its young talent soon. As a sweetener, San Antonio receives Toronto's first round pick in the upcoming draft as well as a young talent in Malachi Flynn, who has shown flashes during his time with the Raptors.</p>

<p>After falling out of Nick Nurse's rotation, Flynn might need new scenery to reach his potential as a former first round pick. As revered as the Raptors' development system is, a switch to the Spurs' famed development system could be what gets the most out of Flynn.</p>

<p>Masai Ujiri has let it be known that he's not content with Play-In appearances, and if he's going to swing, a first round pick is a small price to pay to move his team towards the East's top four.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The United States and Canada will attempt to extend their respective undefeated streaks in the 2022 Winter Olympics when they meet Monday night in Beijing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The teams will face each other for the first time since the 2021 World Championships. Canada defeated the USA 5-1 in the preliminary round and then earned a 3-2 overtime win in the final. The countries have faced each other in the last three Olympic gold-medal games.</p>

<p><strong>BEIJING OLYMPICS: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/olympics/news/olympic-womens-hockey-bracket-standings-2022/i5b6pl4jeuug1xgxqsujkw1d">Women's hockey bracket, standings, results</a></strong></p>

<p>Team USA's most recent game in these Olympics was an 8-0 defeat of Switzerland, the team's second consecutive shutout win. The Americans are 3-0 in Group A. Captain Hilary Knight and&nbsp;Jesse Compher both scored two goals vs. the Swiss; they're now tied for the team lead with Alex Carpenter at three goals each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Team Canada likewise is 3-0 in Group A after rolling past the ROC 6-1 early Monday. The start of the game was delayed by an hour, reportedly because the Russians did not provide their COVID-19 test results to the Canadians. The disruption was not a distraction; Sarah Nurse and Sarah Filler scored 20 seconds apart two minutes into the game. Emerance Maschmeyer made 11 saves for the win in net.</p>

<p>The game will be both teams' final matchup in the preliminary round before the seeds are determined for the quarterfinals, which begin Thursday.&nbsp;</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>NBA trade action is starting to heat up. The <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-trade-grades-clippers-norman-powell-robert-covington-trail-blazers/isj0innybrxpqd1rztj6hea0">Clippers and Blazers made a swap</a> on Friday, and the <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/nba-trade-details-caris-levert-cavaliers-pacers/kl5ayavskns52yvgpiebcpyk">Pacers and Cavs made another</a> on Sunday. Let’s get into what happened for each team.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Clippers-Blazers NBA trade details</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Clippers receive: </strong>Norman Powell, Robert Covington</li>
	<li><strong>Blazers receive: </strong>Eric Bledsoe, Justise Winslow, Keon Johnson, future second-round pick</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clippers grade: A</strong></p>

<p>This is a clear win for the Clippers.</p>

<p>Covington is a good help defender with size at the wing. He’s not as adept at defending on the ball as his reputation suggests, and he can’t do much offensively besides shoot 3’s. Still, he’s a positive overall defender that fits well with what the Clippers need as a 3-and-D wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Powell has had a strong year for the Blazers, averaging 18.7 points on 45.6 percent shooting from the field and 40.6 percent shooting from 3. At 28 years old and in the first year of a five-year, $90 million extension, he’s a solid rotation player that will be locked up through the rest of his productive years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Kawhi Leonard out indefinitely and Paul George missing significant time, the Clippers were one of the teams rumored to have veteran pieces up for sale before this trade occurred. Now, it looks like they are pivoting back to being as competitive as possible. Owner Steve Ballmer is willing to pay an exorbitant luxury tax penalty in order to do so. Kudos to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This also gives the Clippers an open roster spot to convert Amir Coffey’s two-way deal into a regular contract. That will make him eligible for the playoff roster. Coffey isn’t well-known, but he has been a solid rotation player amidst their slew of injuries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Blazers grade: D-</strong></p>

<p>The Blazers did get an okay prospect in Johnson, who was taken with the 21st pick in last year’s draft. He’s got the athleticism to be an NBA player, but he’s still extremely raw and hasn’t impressed in the G-League this season. Still, at just 19 years old, he’s got time to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if you are high on Johnson, this was a pretty poor trade strictly in terms of value for the Blazers. They clearly gave up more from a talent perspective, so why would they ever agree to this deal?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The answer is all about the luxury tax. The Blazers ducked under the tax and also increased the Clippers’ tax bill substantially. The Blazers will now receive around $11 million in tax disbursements at the end of the year, which is a massive payday for ownership but not much consolation to the fanbase.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cavaliers-Pacers NBA trade details</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cavaliers receive:&nbsp;</strong>Caris LeVert</li>
	<li><strong>Pacers receive: </strong>Ricky Rubio, 2022 first-round pick (lottery protected), 2022 second-round pick (via Rockets), 2027 second-round pick (via Jazz)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cavs grade: B</strong></p>

<p>LeVert is a bucket-getter. He’s averaging 18.7 points and dropped 42 on the Bulls in his last official game as a Pacer. He’s been criticized for his lack of efficiency – He’s hitting 45 percent of his shots this year and only 32 percent of his 3’s. But the Cavs need some scoring punch to juice up an offense ranked no. 20 in the league. LeVert can provide that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the way that the Eastern conference is jumbled up, this move makes sense for the Cavs. They have a real shot at one of the top seeds in the conference, and the opportunity cost was low.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pacers grade: B</strong></p>

<p>The Pacers aren’t done here, so it’s difficult to judge this move in a vacuum. More trades are coming, and that’s a good thing for a team that clearly needs change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They’re not really missing much from dealing LeVert. He wasn’t a great fit in coach Rick Carlisle’s system, and he was prone to killing offensive possessions with his takeover of the ball. He was never going to be a part of the next great Pacers team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first rounder from the Cavs will almost certainly convey immediately as an early-to-mid 20’s selection in this summer’s draft. The Pacers also have all of their own first-round picks going forward to rebuild their roster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This trade also positions the Pacers well for free agency. They cut almost $19 million off their books by getting rid of LeVert and will now be major players if they so choose. This summer doesn’t have a great free agent class and the Pacers haven’t exactly been a hotbed for free agents. But with only the Pistons, Spurs, Magic, and Grizzlies projected to have big cap space, maybe they attract some better targets than they would in a normal year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rubio was thrown in solely for salary-matching purposes. He’s an expiring contract and his ACL injury will keep him out for the rest of the season.&nbsp;<br />

        <![CDATA[<p>Something is rotten in Brooklyn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Nets are losers of eight in a row and just got walloped by the Nuggets on Sunday. They’re currently sitting at seventh in the Eastern conference with a 29-24 record. Their play is looking flatter than Kyrie Irving’s perception of the Earth. Could a James Harden-for-Ben Simmons swap actually help them in the immediate short term?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those rumors gained steam on Friday after a report by The Athletic’s Shams Charania. The trade has mostly been discussed from the lens of how it benefits the Sixers. But it might also help the Nets this year. They need some sort of shakeup, because this ain’t it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harden is still having a great season. He was named an All-Star reserve after averaging 22.5 points, 10.2 assists, and 8.0 rebounds per game. Still, he’s definitely fallen way below the top-five level that he was at in previous years. His fit with the Nets hasn’t been great. Charania’s report touched on those problems.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But beyond availability, sources say there have been growing concerns over Harden’s playing style — one of dominant ballhandling and his own pace from his MVP and All-NBA days in Houston — that contrasts with the free-flowing, organic approach from his two co-stars. Nets coach Steve Nash has met with his team’s stars over finding the balance and most beneficial styles, and although there have been bright spots, too often the team has reverted to a more dry offense at the end of games, especially against the league’s elite teams. In addition, the Nets’ game plans tend to shift depending on when Harden is on and off the floor, meaning a different play style at certain points. This has also been a point of contention from the coaching staff and players, sources said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>ESPN’s Zach Lowe hit on the Nets dysfunction in his most recent Lowe Post podcast episode, noting that "this team does not look like it’s in a good place right now. I have not heard fantastic things about the chemistry."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest issue with the Nets is their defense. It stinks. They’re ranked 19th in the league, and Harden is killing them. His most recent performance against the Kings was a pitiful display of effort.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Simmons would immediately address those defensive concerns. It seems like eons, but it was just seven months ago that he finished runner-up in the Defensive Player of the Year voting. The Sixers defense has been missing him, falling from second last year to 11th this year. He would immediately provide the point of attack defense that the Nets have been badly missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simmons would also fit in well with what the Nets are already running defensively. They’ve been a heavy switching team, in part to accommodate how bad Harden has been at getting around screens. At 6-10 with great mobility, Simmons is one of the most switchable players in the league.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two of the Nets’ other areas of weakness are in defensive rebounding, where they are a bottom-five team per Cleaning the Glass, and transition offense where they rank 18th in points added.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simmons would provide a boost in both of those areas. He’s been in the 91st percentile or better as a defensive rebounder for every year in his career, per Cleaning the Glass, and he’s terrific as a transition point forward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simmons seems like a great fit on paper. The obvious question though is if he is mentally prepared to play. The last time we saw him, he looked like he was afraid to shoot the ball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a couple of things working in Brooklyn’s favor here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, coach Steve Nash is used to working with big personalities and has done an admirable job since he took over last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, Simmons could have a reduced role offensively, which would put way less pressure on him. The Nets already have dynamic isolation players in Irving and Kevin Durant to run their halfcourt offense. Simmons could stay in the dunker spot, as he did with the Sixers, and be a low-usage option. He could take over in transition situations and with bench units as the primary ball handler&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admittedly, it might be a challenge to get Simmons to buy into that role. But it’s probably time for the Nets to take that gamble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other reason why this swap might make the Nets better is that it would have to include more players in addition to Simmons. Because of Harden’s $44 million salary, the Sixers would have to throw in at least one more player to make the money match.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Nets need to upgrade some of their bench pieces, so the throw-in that the Sixers provide could legitimately be a difference-maker for them. Tyrese Maxey would be their No. 1 target, but the Sixers almost certainly wouldn’t include him in a deal. There are other solid role players to choose from like Matisse Thybulle, who would greatly help the Nets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It might seem crazy to think that this deal could help the Nets this year. This diminished version of Harden is still a better player than Simmons in a vacuum. But Simmons could be a better fit. And this Nets team has plenty of talent. It's the other stuff that's been missing.</p>

<p>Simmons clearly comes with a ton of risk. But if he can put it together, and that’s a big if, then this could be the move that gets them out of their funk.&nbsp;</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The NBA trade deadline is quickly approaching.</p>

<p>The last day teams can make trades during the 2021-22 season is Thursday, Feb. 10. The cutoff point is 3:00 p.m. ET, though it's not unheard of for some trades to be reported shortly after the deadline.</p>

<p>Now that we're past Dec. 15 and Jan. 15, both of which are important dates on the NBA calendar for trade purposes, pretty much every player in the league can be traded, but there is still a select group of players who can veto any trade. While they don't own a no-trade clause — nobody in the league currently does, not even LeBron James, Stephen Curry or Giannis Antetokounmpo — because of their situation, they have the final say on any deal they're involved in.</p>

<p>As ESPN's Bobby Marks explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>One-year Bird rights</strong>: This restriction applies if a free agent signs a one-year contract and will have Bird rights with his current team when he becomes a free agent. A player can still be traded but must consent to the deal. If he does, the Bird rights do not transfer to his new team.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In total, there are 20 players who fit that description this season, plus Solomon Hill, who signed off on the Hawks trading him to the Knicks in mid-January.</p>

<p>Who are those players, you ask?</p>

<h2>Full list of NBA players who can veto trades in 2021-22 season</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Lou Williams, Atlanta Hawks</li>
	<li>LaMarcus Aldridge, Brooklyn Nets</li>
	<li>Blake Griffin, Brooklyn Nets</li>
	<li>Bruce Brown Jr., Brooklyn Nets</li>
	<li>JaMychal Green, Denver Nuggets</li>
	<li>Austin Rivers, Denver Nuggets</li>
	<li>Frank Jackson, Detroit Pistons</li>
	<li>Cory Joseph, Detroit Pistons</li>
	<li>Rodney McGruder, Detroit Pistons</li>
	<li>Hamidou Diallo, Detroit Pistons</li>
	<li>Nicolas Batum, LA Clippers</li>
	<li>Udonis Haslem, Miami Heat</li>
	<li>Victor Oladipo, Miami Heat</li>
	<li>Dewayne Dedmon, Miami Heat</li>
	<li>Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks</li>
	<li>Bobby Portis, Milwaukee Bucks</li>
	<li>Mike Muscala, Oklahoma City Thunder</li>
	<li>Frank Kaminsky, Phoenix Suns</li>
	<li>Abdel Nader, Phoenix Suns</li>
	<li>Raul Neto, Washington Wizards</li>
</ul>

<p>There's an even smaller group of players who don't become trade eligible until after the deadline because of the type of extension they last signed, headlined by Atlanta's Clint Capela (Feb. 13), Denver's Aaron Gordon (March 27), Indiana's Malcolm Brogdon (April 18) and Philadelphia's Joel Embiid (July 18).</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Brooklyn Nets entered the 2021-22 season with sky-high aspirations as the favorites to win the championship.</p>

<p>Armed with a Big 3 of Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and James Harden, along with a deep list of role players, the Nets, on paper at least have one of the most formidable rosters in the league, however as the All-Star break approaches, things aren't exactly going to plan as they find themselves in the Play-In seeds.</p>

<p><strong>NBA LEAGUE PASS:</strong> <strong>Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial)</strong></p>

<p>Following Sunday's 124-104 loss to the Denver Nuggets — their eighth in a row — the Nets now sit at 29-24 on the season, good for seventh in the Eastern Conference and&nbsp; when asked about the team's level of concern, forward Blake Griffin&nbsp;described it as&nbsp;"very high."</p>

<p>No team in NBA history has gone on to win the championship after suffering a losing streak of seven ore more games (shoutout to the Chicago Sky, who won the 2021 WNBA title after losing seven-straight games).</p>

<p>Despite being wedged in between the Toronto Raptors and Boston Celtics — hardly contending teams in their own right — the Nets are only 4.5 games off the top seed in the East, such is the logjam of teams fighting for playoff seeding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While their current position is of some concern, their lack of consistency, both on the court and in terms of personnel is of far greater concern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>James Harden has struggled to recapture his MVP-level of play, Kevin Durant remains sidelined with a sprained MCL, Kyrie Irving is only available to play in road games and Joe Harris faces the prospect of a second surgery on his left ankle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further to that is the growing speculation surrounding Harden's future in Brooklyn, with reports emerging of a potential deal with the Philadelphia 76ers in the Ben Simmons sweepstakes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teammate Kyrie Irving says Harden is&nbsp;“very committed” based on their conversations.&nbsp;“But who knows what’s going to happen?” he added.</p>

<p>ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski said on&nbsp;<em>NBA Countdown</em>&nbsp;that Harden has told Durant and the Nets front office that he wants to “be there,” as they plan for him to be in a Nets uniform after the trade deadline, saying “there’s a real good chance that’s the case.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's still plenty of basketball to be played this season and the Nets' level of talent would give them plenty of confidence they can turn things around, but the clock is certainly ticking on their title chances this season at least.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai has broken her silence to international media, insisting she wasn't sexually assaulted and she never disappeared.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old's wellbeing and status has become an international incident over the past three months after she made a social media post that accused former Chinese vice premier Zhang Gaoli of sexually assaulting her in 2017.</p>

<p>After the post was removed from social media within an hour, Shuai was not seen in public for weeks, prompting the tennis community and fans to <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/tennis/news/peng-shuai-chinese-tennis-player-missing/16szj5rimxpti1wyxm1ed7hala">express concerns for her welfare</a>, while the WTA canceled tournaments in China and some countries refused to send diplomats to the Beijing 2022 Olympics.</p>

<p><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/tennis/news/former-tennis-pros-criticize-atp-china-peng-shuai/11aqwovymhu0v1fu7dnbf1tx3z">Former tennis pros criticize ATP for not halting play in China</a></strong></p>

<p>While Peng has been <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/tennis/news/chinese-tennis-star-peng-shuai-ioc-video/1b02oxtwrjxde1q6ei3v8o46a2">heard from in recent times</a>, it has been suggested that her words and statements had been influenced by Chinese authorities.</p>

<p>However, Peng has now given an interview to French publisher L'Equipe, where she denies ever being assaulted or having disappeared.</p>

<p>It is the second time Peng has <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/tennis/news/peng-shuai-retracts-sexual-assault-allegations-claims-misunderstanding/1n0vpl7b7yjfs1htevfnlhjczu">publicly retracted the initial allegations she made</a>.</p>

<p>"First of all, I would like to thank all the ATP and WTA players, all the athletes and all the personalities in large numbers who cared about me," she said from Beijing, with Chinese Olympic Committee chief of staff Wang Kan beside her.</p>

<p>"But I didn’t think there would be such concern and I would like to know: Why such concern?"</p>

<p>"I never said anyone sexually assaulted me in any way.</p>

<p>"I never disappeared, everyone could see me. It's just that a lot of people, like my friends, including from the IOC, messaged me, and it was quite impossible to reply to so many messages.</p>

<p>"But with my close friends, I always remained in close contact. I discussed with them, answered their emails, I also discussed with the WTA.</p>

<p>"But, at the end of the year, their website’s communication computer was changed and many players had difficulty logging in at that time.</p>

<p>"But we always kept in touch with colleagues. That’s why I don’t know why the information that I had disappeared, spread.</p>

<p>"This post has given rise to a huge misunderstanding from the outside world. I hope that we no longer distort the meaning of this post. And I also hope that we don’t add more hype on this."</p>

<p>Peng hasn't played in a tournament since the Qatar Total Open in February 2020. She was once ranked as high as 14th in the world in singles and No. 1 in doubles, winning two Grand Slam events in doubles.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Mikaela Shiffrin, the 2018 Olympic gold medalist in the giant slalom, saw her title defense end early.</p>

<p>Shiffrin failed to finish the first run of her first event of the Beijing Winter Olympics on Sunday night (Monday morning in China). She booted out entering the turn into the seventh gate. Shiffrin lost the edge of her ski as she tried to cut a sharp angle.</p>

<p>The fall disqualified her from the event.</p>

<p>Because she failed to finish her first run, she didn't get a chance at making her second run in the event and thus didn't get a chance to medal.</p>

<p>It was her first DNF in the discipline in over four years.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

— Nick Zaccardi (@nzaccardi) February 7, 2022</blockquote>

<p>Shiffrin described what happened in a postrace interview with NBC.</p>

<p>"I was attacking and it was just a small mistiming of when I set my edges and just slipped out, and it was such an amazing surface and amazing conditions," she said. "You don't have any room for small errors. I was pushing, so I was happy about that, but . . . it stings."</p>

<p>She was looking to become the first American alpine ski racer to win three Olympic gold medals, having also won the slalom in Sochi in 2014.</p>

<p>While Shiffrin's quest for gold in the giant slalom ended, she still has a chance for gold in these Olympics. She'll ski in the four other events in this cycle — the women's Super-G (Feb. 10), women's downhill (Feb. 14), women's combined downhill (Feb. 16) and women's combined slalom (Feb. 17).</p>

<p>Shiffrin was disappointed by the result but also acknowledged that she will have more chances to leave her mark in Beijing.</p>

<p>"It's hard not to dwell but I just cannot afford to spend or waste energy on something that's now in the past. I'm going to reset and focus on what I can control," she said. "It's still a long two weeks and I'm still looking forward to it, but I'm not going to dwell, because that won't help me at all."</p>

<p>She has won 11 World Cup titles and has six World Championship titles, including four in the slalom and one in the Super-G.</p>

<h3><strong>Game situation</strong></h3>

<p>The Celtics led 55-45 midway through the third quarter before Brown quietened the Amway Center with the monster poster dunk.</p>

<h3><strong>Difficulty</strong></h3>

<p>A cutting Brown picked up the bounce pass from Marcus Smart and only has eyes for the rim.</p>

<p>Despite Magic center Mo Bamba getting across the lane to contest the dunk, Brown jumped off two feet, strapped on the jetpack and went right at the big man, finishing through contact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I mean...he was right there.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Two of the NBA's most exciting big men have been putting in that <em>work</em> this season.</p>

<p><strong>NBA LEAGUE PASS:</strong> <strong>Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial)</strong></p>

<p>Ever since last season, these two have been mentioned as a part of the best players in the league conversation, and while Joel Embiid led the MVP race for a time, it was the Nuggets' Nikola Jokic who was named the 2020-21 winner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Sunday against the Nets, Jokic recorded his 14th triple-double of the season, finishing with 27 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, while Embiid had another monster 40-point double-double in the 76ers win over the Bulls, ending the night with 40 points and 10 rebounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This season it seems like these two have elevated their games and we, the fans, are better for it.</p>

<p>Both guys are very enjoying tremendous seasons, and are on course to get their respective teams into the top four seedings of their conferences to potentially make deep playoff runs which begs the question: Which big man is having the better season so far?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nick Metallinos (@nickmetallinos):&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Asking me who is having the better season is like asking me which is my favorite Jay Z album. One day I might tell you Reasonable Doubt, another day American Gangster. What these guys are doing this season has been nothing short of spectacular and my opinion on who's having a better season changes weekly it seems.</p>

<p>Some days I think Joel Embiid is the best player in the world, other days Nikola Jokic's skill has me so amazed I think he is the best.</p>

<p>Jokic has had notched 14 triple-doubles this season and if he persists the way he's going, he will finish with the highest PER single-season rating in history (currently at 33.16) ... but the Nuggets are in sixth in the West.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Embiid, on the other hand, is single-handedly dragging Philly as close to the top of the East as he can get. He's had seven 40-point games this season alone (13 in his previous five seasons combined), he's won back-to-back Player of the Month awards, and is averaging a career-high in assists and career-low in turnovers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I'm being asked this question<em> today</em> I'm going with Embiid (Reasonable Doubt) over Jokic (American Gangster), but that could change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gilbert McGregor (@GMcGregor21</strong>):&nbsp;</p>

<p>What initially felt like a difficult decision really wasn't that difficult at all.</p>

<p>It's Jokic.</p>

<p>Thinking back to last season, Jokic finished first in MVP voting while Embiid was runner-up. Both centers are even better than they were last season but because Jokic has improved just as much as Embiid – if not more – the gap remains between the two.</p>

<p>Put it this way: Embiid has done things this season that make me believe he is the most dominant player in the league. Jokic, on the other hand, is doing things that have made me wonder whether or not he's the best overall player in the NBA.</p>

<p>That said, I'm not even putting Embiid down here, it's just the fact that Jokic has been so good. Like, historically good.<br />
A second MVP could be on the way.</p>

<p><strong>Benyam Kidane (@BenyamKidane):&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Both players have the unenviable task of leading their depleted teams this season and it's their elite play that's made both the Nuggets and 76ers stay alive in their respective playoff races.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel like I've run out of superlatives for Jokic,&nbsp; as he continues to produce plays few in the NBA could muster, but I've got to give the nod to Embiid&nbsp;<em>just,&nbsp;</em>due to the fact the 76ers, without their second-best player in Ben Simmons are somehow fourth in the Eastern Conference, just 1.5 games out of the top seed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>None of that is possible without Embiid playing at a superhuman level, who has boosted not only his scoring production, but his playmaking, which has trickled down to elevate the likes of Tyrese Maxey, Seth Curry and Matisse Thybulle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this rate, the MVP race is going to come down to these two big men once again. Embiid's health cost him a real shot at the award in 2020-21, but this season the 76ers big man has been consistent and looks like the best player in the league.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Dolphins have landed their next head coach.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">The team announced Sunday that they have hired 49ers offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel for the position. ESPN's Adam Schefter reported the Dolphins signed McDaniel to a four-year contract.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">McDaniel, who according to ESPN's Marcel-Louis Jacques identifies as "multiracial," is the first minority hire this offseason among nine head coaching vacancies.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">The Dolphins fired Brian Flores on Jan. 10 after he led them to a 9-8 finish in 2021, including a seven-game winning streak and an 8-1 record in the team's final nine games. <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/brian-flores-lawsuit-explained-nfl-dolphins/17pmh4f1j1pmm15u24qvwjvvmv">Flores is suing the Dolphins, Giants, Broncos and NFL</a> in a class-action lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in hiring practices.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">There are still two head coaching vacancies left: the Saints and Texans.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">McDaniel being multiracial means the 49ers will receive two compensatory <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/what-is-rooney-rule-nfl-minority-candidates-effectiveness-criticisms/1k4m7oilxr8nv1xjs9f9bw2k7d">third-round draft picks under the Rooney Rule</a>,&nbsp;because a minority assistant was hired as a head coach.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">McDaniel is the latest under-40 coach to be chosen to run a team, and his hiring by Miami comes as both Super Bowl coaches (Zac Taylor of the Bengals and Sean McVay of the Rams) are under 40. Heading into the 2022 season, at least five of the league's head coaches will be under 40. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski and Falcons coach Arthur Smith turn 40 before the start of the season.</p>

<p class="text-align-center">Here's all you need to know about McDaniel:</p>

<h2 class="text-align-center">Mike McDaniel coaching career</h2>

<p>McDaniel's playing days ended in 2005 at Yale, where he was a wide receiver. The history major immediately traded in his pads for a clipboard and a spot along the sideline.</p>

<p>McDaniel was first hired as an intern with the Broncos under Mike Shanahan in 2005 and later spent three seasons with the Texans. He was the running backs coach for the Sacramento Mountain Lions in the United Football League from 2009-10 before returning to the NFL to join Washington in 2011.</p>

<p>While in Washington, again under Shanahan, he worked on a staff loaded with assistants who went on to become head coaches. The offensive coordinator was Mike Shanahan's son Kyle, the quarterbacks coach was Matt LaFleur and the tight ends coach was McVay. McDaniel was an offensive assistant for two seasons before moving up to wide receivers coach.</p>

<p><strong>MORE: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/pro-bowl-2022-live-score-highlights-results/dgm81p4edkhoyljfvj0u7zm8">NFL Pro Bowl final score, highlights</a></strong></p>

<p>McDaniel spent 2014 as wide receivers coach for the Browns before moving to the same position for the Falcons in 2015. He was in Atlanta in 2015 and 2016; the Falcons ranked in the top six in passing yards both years. In the 2016 season, the Falcons reached Super Bowl 51, where they lost to the Patriots 34-28 in overtime.</p>

<p>He was reunited with a Shanahan head coach, this time Kyle, with the 49ers in 2017, to serve as the team's run game coordinator. In his four seasons in charge of the run game, the 49ers tallied the 11th-most rushing yards in the NFL, according to Stathead.</p>

<p>McDaniel was promoted to offensive coordinator ahead of the 2021 season. This past season, San Francisco had 6,387 total yards of offense (seventh in the NFL) and scored 427 points (13th) as the team made it to the NFC championship game, where it lost to the Rams.</p>

<p>In Miami, McDaniel will take over an offense that ranked 30th in rushing yards (1,568), 25th in total yards (5,219) and 22nd in points scored (341).</p>

<h2>How old is Mike McDaniel?</h2>

<p>McDaniel is only 38, making him the fourth-youngest coach heading into next season.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>For a second consecutive year, we'll get Team LeBron vs. Team Durant at the NBA All-Star Game, as LeBron James and Kevin Durant were again the leading vote-getters in their respective conferences.</p>

<p>But who will be manning the sidelines?</p>

<p>As in years past, coaches for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game will be decided by the standings. The head coach of the team with the West's best record on Sunday, Feb. 6 will be tabbed to coach Team LeBron while the head coach of the team with the East's best record on Sunday, Feb. 6 will coach Team Durant.</p>

<p>Per NBA rules, last year's&nbsp;All-Star Game coaches are ineligible to coach this year, disqualifying Jazz head coach Quin Snyder and 76ers head coach Doc Rivers.</p>

<p>Who will coach in the 2022 NBA All-Star Game?</p>

<h2>Who are the coaches for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game?</h2>

<h2><strong>Team LeBron:&nbsp;</strong>Monty Williams, Suns</h2>

<p>Fresh off of an appearance in the 2021 NBA Finals, Williams has gotten the Suns out to a historic start in his third season at the helm.</p>

<p>Because of their historic pace, Williams and his staff earned the right to lead Team LeBron by clinching the West's best record through games played on Feb. 6, doing so a week ahead of time. With a win over the Spurs on Jan. 30, the Suns picked up their 10th consecutive win to move to 40-9 on the season, reaching a win total that no other Western Conference team could reach in the next week.</p>

<p>Williams will coach in the All-Star Game for the first time in his career and becomes the first Suns head coach to coach an All-Star Game since Mike D'Antoni in 2007. He will be joined by his coaching staff, which features Kevin Young, Mark Bryant, Bryan Gates, Brian Randle, Randy Ayers, Michael Ruffin, Steve Scalzi and Jarrett Jack.</p>

<p>Suns guards Devin Booker and Chris Paul will also be on hand at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game.</p>

<h2>Team Durant: Erik Spoelstra, Heat</h2>

<p>It came down to the final day, but the nod went to Spoelstra, whose Heat hold the East's first seed through games played on Feb. 6.</p>

<p>As the top coach in the Eastern Conference, Spoelstra will coach the team selected by Nets superstar Kevin Durant.</p>

<p>The achievement is especially impressive for Spoelstra, as Miami has struggled to stay healthy throughout the first half of the 2021-22 campaign. That the Heat are at the top of the East standings despite barely having their full rotation this season speaks to the coaching job that Spoelstra has done.</p>

<p>2022 marks the second time that Spoelstra has coached the All-Star Game, with his first coming in 2013 as the coach of the Eastern Conference All-Stars.</p>

<p>Spoelstra, the second-longest tenured coach in the NBA, will be joined by Heat assistants Chris Quinn, Malik Allen, Caron Butler, Octavio De La Grana, Anthony Carter and Eric Glass in Cleveland.</p>

<p>In addition to Spoelstra, forward Jimmy Butler will represent Miami at the All-Star Game.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Senegal lifted the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations title after beating Egypt 4-2 on penalties in Sunday's final at the Olembe Stadium.</p>

<p>It was a goalless affair after 120 minutes of football at the Olembe Stadium despite Senegal’s dominance but both teams were separated by a penalty shoot-out. Egypt was vying to win the crown having scored just four goals all tournament long.</p>

<p>The Teranga Lions overcame disappointment from the 2019 tournament in Egypt, where they fell in the final to Algeria, to claim their first AFCON title in their third final appearance.</p>

<p>In the absence of suspended Egypt head coach Carlos Queiroz, the nation's former U-20 coach Diaa El Sayed took over duties pitchside. Emam Ashour was the only change made to the Pharaohs' starting XI that defeated Cameroon in the semifinal. Queiroz was banned after being sent off in the win over Cameroon, clashing with the official just before the start of the penalty shootout.</p>

<p>Senegal, on the other hand, handed Watford winger Ismaila Sarr his maiden start in the tournament and his presence contributed to the attacking dominance of Aliou Cisse's men. The Teranga Lions started their push for an opener early in the encounter and it resulted in a penalty after Mohamed Abdelmonem brought down Saliou Ciss in the fourth minute.</p>

<p>The Egypt defender got the first yellow card of the game and Sadio Mane stepped forward to take the spot-kick but his shot was saved by goalkeeper Mohamed Abou Gabal. Cameras caught Mane's Liverpool teammate Mohamed Salah talking to Gabal just before the penalty, with fans speculating that Salah's knowledge of Mane's tendencies contributed to the save.</p>

<p>The miss did not deter Senegal who kept on the pressure for an opening goal with Sarr's run and creativity on the flanks, but the 23-year-old’s crosses were not converted.</p>

<p>Egypt had its first shot on target in the 43rd minute as Salah forced Edouard Mendy to make save with his right-footed shot inside the box.</p>

<p>The first-half ended with Senegal’s dominance and it continued after the break with Mane winning a free-kick on the edge of the box but Idrissa Gueye's effort went wide off target in the 48th minute.</p>

<p>Cisse switched his attacking tactics and drafted fresh legs up front with Bamba Dieng and Boulaye Dia replacing Famara Diedhiou and Sarr respectively in the 77th minute.</p>

<p>Aliou Cisse’s men continued their dominance in the extra-time and Dieng came close with a header but it was parried by Abou Gabal for corner-kick.</p>

<p>The Marseille striker had another attempt at goal with a superb shot from about 30 yards but it was saved by Gabaski again. It was Egypt's turn to test Mendy in the 115th minute but the Chelsea goalkeeper palmed over Marwan Hamdy's shot.</p>

<p>For Senegal, Koulibaly and Abdou Diallo stepped forward to convert the first two attempts in the penalty shoot-out but Egypt missed their second effort as Abdelmonem’s strike hit the upright. Gabaski was called to action and he saved Bouna Sarr’s effort while Mendy comfortably saved Mohanad Lasheen’s shot and Mane stepped up to score the match-winning kick.</p>

<p>Salah, who had been saved until the fifth position, did not get to take a penalty in the shootout with the result confirmed before his slot came up.</p>

<p>Mane, for his efforts, was controversially crowned Player of the Tournament over Vincent Aboubakar, who scored a whopping eight goals for Cameroon to lead the host nation in a third-placed effort. Aboubakar's goal tally was the most in an AFCON finals since 1974.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The Cavaliers have reportedly landed a top trade target.</p>

<p>According to a report from ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Cavaliers will receive Caris LeVert from the Pacers in exchange for Ricky Rubio, a lottery-protected 2022 first-round pick, a 2022 second-round pick and a future second-round pick.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Here's all you need to know about the deal.</p>

<h2><strong>Cavaliers-Pacers NBA trade details</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Cavaliers receive:&nbsp;</strong>Caris LeVert</li>
	<li><strong>Pacers receive:</strong>&nbsp;Ricky Rubio, 2022 first-round pick (lottery protected), 2022 second-round pick (via Rockets), 2027 second-round pick (via Jazz)</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the NBA's most surprising successes this season, the Cavaliers make a major win-now move in acquiring LeVert, who is averaging 18.7 points, 4.4 assists and 3.8 rebounds through 39 games this season.</p>

<p>The Cavs entered the deal just 1.5 games out of the East's top seed despite season-ending injuries to Rubio and 2018 lottery pick Collin Sexton.</p>

<p>With Rubio and Sexton out for the season, the Cavaliers needed to bring in more guard depth in order to have a chance to contend in the Eastern Conference as soon as this season.</p>

<p>LeVert, 27, is a native of Pickerington, Ohio, and returns to his home state to add more depth and scoring to the Cavs, joining a backcourt that already features first-time All-Star Darius Garland.</p>

<p>He is also reunited with former Nets teammate Jarrett Allen.</p>

<p>The move confirms that the Pacers will be sellers at the trade deadline, as Rubio will not be able to suit up this season after tearing his ACL in late December.</p>

<p>Rubio will be a free agent following the 2021-22 season and his $17.8 million contract is set to come off of the Pacers' books.</p>

<p>Barring a historic meltdown from the Cavs, the lottery-protected first-round pick will convey to the Pacers in 2022, giving them another asset to build with for the future.</p>

<h2>Caris LeVert contract</h2>

<p>LeVert signed a three-year, $52 million contract in 2020.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>RJ Barrett made a statement in the Knicks' narrow overtime loss to the Lakers on Saturday.</p>

<p>In front of a primetime national audience in the United States, Barrett erupted for a career-high 36 points to go along with eight rebounds and five assists while taking on the defensive assignment of guarding LeBron James at times.</p>

<p><strong>NBA LEAGUE PASS:</strong> <strong>Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial)</strong></p>

<p>Among those impressed by Barrett's career performance was James, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/ca/nba/news/lebron-james-return-lakers/m2cnro26pkpm0dgrie5kp4bc">who finished with a triple-double in his first action in nearly two weeks</a>.</p>

<p>Following the game, James spoke glowingly of the 21-year-old, detailing a few of Barrett's big moments from the night before sharing that the origin of their relationship dates back several years to a summer workout in Barrett's native Toronto.</p>

<p>"I think he had 17 in the first quarter if I'm not mistaken and he hit some big-time shots down the stretch," James began.</p>

<p>"I've been knowing RJ for quite a while now," James continued, "I was in Toronto during the summertime, I think he was a high school junior or a senior and there was a call to my agent Rich (Paul), that there was a kid in Toronto that's possibly next.</p>

<p>"It was the offseason, I was in Toronto, just having a good time in Toronto and I was just going to the gym to get some work in and they called Rich and asked could [Barrett] join and I was like 'absolutely.'"</p>

<p>James added that after that workout, he continued to follow Barrett during his high school career and at Duke, even attending a game at the University of Virginia to watch Barrett and college teammates Cam Reddish and Zion Williamson.</p>

<p>As James knows a thing or two about producing at a young age in the league, perhaps his biggest compliments were of Barrett's ability to do so in a tough New York market.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He's young so he's going to have bumps and bruises throughout the course of [his] career while you're young, you're figuring out the game, you're figuring out the speed, you're figuring out the tempo and things of that nature but I think he's handled it extremely well, especially being in a different light and a different heat, when you play for the Knicks and I think he's handled it extremely well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following the game, Barrett and James shared a moment on the floor before heading to their respective locker rooms.</p>

<p>Barrett, who is averaging a career-best 17.9 points through 46 games this year, has already surpassed the 30-point mark six times this season after doing so just once last season.</p>

<p>With New York looking to make a postseason push during the stretch run, Barrett must continue his emergence towards stardom.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The saga between Kevin Durant and Stephen A. Smith continues.</p>

<p>The most recent chapter between the two began on Thursday, when Smith fired off a take regarding Durant's legacy during an appearance on ESPN's "NBA Today." Durant responded via Twitter, calling Smith's take "egregious," a point to which Smith seemingly agreed.</p>

<p><strong>MORE: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nba/news/kevin-durant-stephen-smith-comments-legacy/qha5wcj3ziu8jlkrdua4va78">Kevin Durant's perfect one-word response to Stephen A. Smith's comments</a></strong></p>

<p>The two agreed and that was that, right? Well, not quite.</p>

<p>On Saturday, Smith addressed the Twitter back-and-forth with Durant on "NBA Countdown" with Mike Greenberg, Michael Wilbon and Jalen Rose.</p>

<p><strong>NBA LEAGUE PASS:</strong> <strong>Sign up to unlock live out-of-market games (7-day free trial)</strong></p>

<p>"We all love basketball and we know how phenomenal KD is – I think he's the best in the world when healthy, that's just the amount of respect I have for him, but I've been in the media for a little while," Smith clarified before doubling down.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There's going to be people – especially if Golden State wins and Brooklyn doesn't win, with all of this stuff that went on this year – that is going to look at his choice to join with Kyrie Irving and depart from Steph Curry as opposed to staying with Steph Curry, that's all I'm saying. I ain't saying it's fair, I'm not saying it's right. When KD tweeted and said it was 'egregious' for me to say that on "NBA Today" with Malika (Andrews) and Chiney (Ogwumike), I tweeted back 'you're absolutely right, it is egregious, it's unfair, it ain't right, you deserve better,' but since when has that had anything to do with headlines on the back pages?</p>

<p>After a one-word response on Friday, Durant returned to Twitter on Sunday to respond to Smith's commentary with a more in-depth reply, beginning by calling the longtime NBA analyst "Steve."</p>

<p>"Steve, since u decided to use ESPN to push your personal agendas, im sure your minions will run with this story for you, but if u believe this is what my career is defined by then you just a flat out hater," Durant said in response to the video.</p>

<p>The two-time NBA Finals MVP closed by adding "it's gonna be hard to box the god in."</p>

<p>At the time of Durant's response, he was preparing to miss his 11th consecutive game with a sprained MCL while his Nets looked to snap a seven-game skid in the midst of a number of trade rumors.</p>

<p>The level of frustration is understandable.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Few Olympians have dominated their sport in the way Lindsey Vonn has over her career.</p>

<p>Vonn possesses the second-highest super ranking (297.00) among all alpine skiers, behind only Austrian legend Marcel Hirscher (359.40) as the most accomplished skiers of all time. She is one of only two women to win four World Cup overall titles and she won eight World Cup downhill championships, including six in a row. She also has 20 crystal globes, the most of any skier in history, and three Olympic medals.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Vonn has always been must-see TV when she is on the screen.</p>

<p>With the 2022 Winter Games in full swing, fans are hoping to catch another glimpse of her on the slopes. But will they see her in Beijing?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's what you need to know about Vonn this year:</p>

<h2>Is Lindsey Vonn competing in the 2022 Olympics?</h2>

<p>Vonn will not be competing in the 2022 Beijing Games, nor will she be seen competitively on the slopes again.</p>

<p>Back in 2019, Vonn announced her retirement from alpine skiing after the World Championships in Are, Sweden. Vonn explained that she had sustained many more injuries over her career than most knew and said she had kept a few surgeries out of the headlines to avoid it becoming the center of attention.</p>

<p><strong>MORE: <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/olympics/news/how-many-gold-medals-usa-2022-olympic-winners-united-states/veec98a6j3eoirxzz7yxwjce">How many gold medals does USA have?</a></strong></p>

<p>"My body is broken beyond repair and it isn't letting me have the final season I dreamed of. My body is screaming at me to STOP and it's time for me to listen," Vonn wrote on Facebook. "At this point, arthritis is the least of my worries and I hope I can still ski with my kids some day. But even knowing what lies ahead for my body, it has still been worth it. I have always worked hard, fought back and dealt with whatever comes my way because I simply love skiing. At no point have I ever regretted my injuries, my comebacks, the therapy, the preparation even even the pain because in my mind it has always been worth it."</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="761" scrolling="no" src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpermalink.php%3Fstory_fbid%3D10157243499909728%26id%3D89975379727&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" width="500"></iframe></p>

<p>Vonn looked back at her historic career that included 82 wins, 137 total trips to the podium, four overall titles and 16 discipline titles&nbsp;at the World Cup in 19 seasons, seven World Championship medals and three Olympic medals.</p>

<p>"Please let my story be of comebacks, victories and even injuries, but do not tell my story as one of failures or unreached goals," Vonn wrote. "I always say, 'Never give up!' So to all the kids out there, to my fans who have sent me messages of encouragement to keep going ... I need to tell you that I'm not giving up! I'm just starting a new chapter. Don't lose faith in your dreams, keep fighting for what you love, and if you always give everything you have you'll be happy no matter what the outcome."</p>

<p>But viewers will still have a chance to see Vonn on their screens this season. NBC announced that she will be a primetime correspondent at the 2022 Winter Games.</p>

<p>"I am excited to share my perspective along with my insight on what athletes might be feeling during high pressure moments," Vonn said in NBC's release. "My first memories of Olympics were from NBC broadcast, so I am very excited to be working with a team that has been there for so many amazing Olympic moments."</p>

<h2>How old was Lindsey Vonn in her first Olympics?</h2>

<p>Vonn has been on the international skiing scene for a long time. She first made an appearance on the U.S. Olympic team as a 17-year-old in 2002 at the Salt Lake City Games.</p>

<p>She raced in slalom and combined at those Games and placed sixth in combined. She earned her first major medal at the 2003 Puy St. Vincent Junior World Ski Championships in downhill. Vonn, then Lindsey Kildow, won two more medals — a silver in downhill and bronze in giant slalom — in the next year's junior world ski championships as well.</p>

<h2>How many Olympic medals has Lindsey Vonn won?</h2>

<p>In her career, Vonn has totaled three Olympic medals. She earned a gold in downhill and bronze in the super-G at the 2010 Vancouver Games, and took home bronze in the downhill at the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.</p>

<p>Her first Olympic medals came after she had already begun to take home plenty of hardware in World Cup and World Championship events. Coming into the Vancouver Olympics, she had earned two overall World Cup titles, two downhill crowns and a super-G title. She had also won the downhill and super-G gold medals in the 2009 Val-d'Isere World Championships.</p>

<p>The only Olympics Vonn missed came in the 2014 Sochi Winter Games due to a knee injury she had suffered the previous winter.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>There were a lot of points, a lot of interceptions and a lot of new rules, and ultimately the AFC prevailed in the 2022 Pro Bowl, winning 41-35.</p>

<p>This year's game eliminated kickoffs entirely and replaced them with "spot-and-choose" decisions to begin halves. After that, following each score, the scoring team could retain possession of the ball at their own 25 and be faced with fourth-and-15 or give the ball to the opposing team and try to stop it.</p>

<p>More often than not, the two sides opted for the former and very rarely converted, and even threw several interceptions on those attempts.</p>

<p>As is usually the case, the ground games weren't much of a factor. The NFC ran the ball eight times for 1 yard and the AFC ran it 21 times for 52 yards.</p>

<p>All six quarterbacks saw action, with Kyler Murray (18-for-27 passing, 160 yards, three touchdowns) seeing most of the playing time for the NFC and Mac Jones (12-of-16 passing, 112 yards, one touchdown) doing the same for the AFC.</p>

<p>Each QB threw at least one pick, while Justin Herbert was the only other quarterback to notch multiple touchdowns, hitting Ravens tight end Mark Andrews twice.</p>

<p>Andrews led all receivers with five catches for 82 yards and two scores, while Mike Evans was the NFC's leading receiver with two catches for 50 yards.</p>

<p>Each team fumbled multiple times, but the NFC was the only team to lose a fumble, while seven different players notched interceptions — including Darius Leonard and Antoine Winfield Jr., who both had pick-sixes.</p>

<p>The AFC's win is the conference's fifth in a row and extends its all-time series lead to 26-22.</p>

<p><b>3:00 p.m.:&nbsp;</b>So the NFC is starting the game at its own 15 yard line as a result of the spot-and-choose. Kyler Murray taking the first snaps of the game at QB for the NFC.</p>

<p><strong>2:54 p.m.:&nbsp;</strong>In addition to the spot and choose rule, some other variations on play that you'll see: no blitzing and no nickel or dime packages and defenses will be in 4-3 personnel. Offensively, the team has to have a running back and tight end on the field.&nbsp;</p>
