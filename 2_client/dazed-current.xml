<p><span>“One day, I noticed an advertisement on the tube showing how friendly, inclusive and open the London tube network wants to be,” photographer </span><span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/shouanfoto/">Shou-An Chiang</a> recalls. “</span><span>This was represented by a photograph of two girls embracing with a look of love in their eyes. The slogan was brief, saying ‘dinner date’, with the implication that the two in the photo were romantically involved.”</span> </p>
<p><span>Chiang’s initial impression of the image was positive: “Seeing that these two girls were people of colour, I appreciated that TFL was attempting to be inclusive.” But her response to the advert began to alter the following day as it occurred to her how rarely she saw queer Asian people represented in the media. The Taiwanese-born, London-based photographer explains to Dazed in a conversation over email, “The inclusion of our faces in adverts is not uncommon among all sorts of media, but always in bland and monotonous contexts in themes such as business, school, or science.”</span></p><p><span>Struggling to understand why the dominant portrayal of Asian people is so narrow and desexualised, Chiang began to conceive of a photo project that would speak to this lack of representation: “Where does this Western notion of Asia come from? And why does it always fall short of showcasing the real diversity in our lives? As a member of this community, I know that we are more than the flat profile presented by most advertisements. I wanted to offer the diverse possibilities of this community without prejudice.”</span></p>
<p><em><span>Queerasian </span></em><span>is an alluring series of portraits of individuals from within the queer Asian community in London. Part documentary and part staged, Chiang’s beautifully composed pictures allow her subjects to retain their own varied and glorious subjectivity. “I went to each participant’s home to take pictures. They dressed up in whatever way they felt comfortable… I wanted to capture them in their own lives in a way that was a little out of the ordinary but not too contrived. The principle of the whole process remains the same: they should be comfortable and at ease.”</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>What emerges is a meditation on the breadth and depth of expressions of sexuality, gender and identity within the queer Asian community. “I think the stories are in the details – through the objects in a scene, you can see how each person lives, what they do, their background, their interests and so on. Through the way they dress, we can see how they want to present themselves. When we look at these images without preconceptions, we find that self and identity do not need to be labelled – they can be fluid; they can be self-constituted.”</span></p>
<p><span>Chiang shared a number of poignant and enduring memories from among the many </span><em><span>Queerasian</span></em><span> shoots. One particular moment that stayed with her was a conversation with one of the mixed-race participants: “He said that whenever he had to fill in some equality and diversity monitoring forms there are no black-Asian boxes. He told me, ‘I can only use ‘other’ to explain who I am and what I belong to.’ This is something I hadn’t noticed before. If I hadn’t met him for this project, I probably wouldn’t have realised that there were more inclusive possibilities in these forms that are actually created to promote diversity.”</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>In the future, Chiang hopes to increase the breadth of the project by photographing as many people from different parts of Asia as possible. As an ongoing project, </span><em><span>Queerasians </span></em><span>continues to contribute to a vital dialogue. Chiang describes how the process of making these images is enlarging her empathy and understanding while stimulating important wider conversations around the work: “Every time I hear a story it opens my mind a little more. One of the subjects shared her identity anxiety with me. Even though her relationships were with cis men, she did not consider herself to be a purely heterosexual woman. But she was worried that she did not have enough relationship experience to qualify as a ‘queer’. When I shared this story at the exhibition, I was touched by the feedback of one of the audience. She said she could relate to it very much. In her experience, she too had some vague and ambiguous desires, but circumstances prevented her from taking any action at the time. Now, years later, she is afraid to call herself a queer even if she wants to. She feels guilty because she didn’t contribute to the community. And now she feels like she is not eligible to reap the fruits of predecessors’ efforts.”</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Grounded: the revival of Kelela</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">It’s been five years since Kelela’s first album, Take Me Apart, carved new futures for Black electronic music. Now, after steeling herself with a crash course in misogynoir and Black queer philosophy, she’s back to raise the bar once more</h3>

<p><span><em>Taken from the autumn 2022 issue of Dazed. You can buy a copy of our latest issue <a href="http://www.boutiquemags.com/dpa/add/tocart/id/10948"><em>here.</em></a></em></span></p>
<p>This is not a comeback tale; instead, it is nothing short of the revival of <a href="/tag/kelela">Kelela</a>. A jubilee, of sorts, for a beloved artist who hasn’t been gone at all – she’s been listening. Since dipping ever so slightly beyond our reach, she has been setting the conditions under which she constructs her world and creates her art. This has been her way since the release of her first mixtape, <em>CUT 4 ME</em>, in 2013 up until her last release, <em>Take Me Apart</em>, in 2017 and the remix album that followed.</p><p><span>In 2019, Kelela created her own reading primer filled with articles, books, podcasts, videos and documentaries and started to send it out to her friends, family and business partners. She included resources like <em>Reader on Misogynoir</em> by <a href="/tag/kandis-williams">Kandis Williams</a>, <em>The will to change</em> by <a href="/tag/bell-hooks">bell hooks</a> and <em>Algorithms of Oppression</em> by <a href="https://safiyaunoble.com/">Safiya Umoja Noble</a>. She sent links to the <em>Seeing White</em> podcast and IGTV videos from <a href="https://www.sonyareneetaylor.com/">Sonya Renee Taylor</a> about Black labour called, <em>Are you stealing from Black folks?</em> and <em>More on Stealing from Black People: Right Relationship Beyond Capitalism</em>. She even included work from Black men like <em>Heavy: </em>an <em>American Memoir</em> by Kiese Laymon and Damon Young’s viral article “Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People”, adding personal notes like “Only thing I would add is that cis gay Black men are also the white people of Black people, especially in the creative industries where they are often allowed into positions of power right after white women.”</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, she included documentaries that tied these radical texts back to her genre and medium of choice, dance music, through recommendations like<em> The Last Angel of History </em>(1996), which features interviews from the late <a href="/life-culture/article/46293/1/five-feminist-sci-fi-books-octavia-butler-andrea-lawlor-new-suns-barbican">Octavia E Butler</a> and Greg Tate. Reading through these letters took my love for Kelela as a person and artist to a deeper level of unconditional love and appreciation, because I know this fight.</span></p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><span>It is why she is often the soundtrack to every Black queer function, especially here in Los Angeles. Her voice, synths and beat loops pulsate through rooms under the groove of DJs like Sevyn of Fluid Radio, Terrell Brooke from the Cuties Color Party, or Bae Bae at Hood Rave. Let’s not forget those seminal sex scenes in both of Issa Rae’s hit TV shows, <em>Insecure</em> and <em>Rap Sh!t</em>. Despite being one of the few prominent Black women in the electronic dance music industry, Kelela’s impact on the culture is undeniable and honoured by those who have delighted in walking through her packed live shows, where she commands her audiences to create a path for us Black, queer and femme folk to take up space at the front.</span></p>
<p><span>After spending a 90-degree Sunday together for the first time in LA, making a URL relationship IRL official, she asked me to conduct her first interview in three years. So, with that, we rolled up, ordered lunch and jumped on Zoom for another few hours – this time, to publicly talk about her return to music, and everything that comes with opening yourself back up to public consumption.</span></p><p><strong>Kelela: </strong><span>This has really only been a break from social media. You know that’s all we’re talking about. Because I’ve definitely been living a life outside of the internet, but also fully on the internet! As many of my audience members have noted online, liking all kinds of shit!</span></p>
<p><strong>Facts. One time, I had just returned home from being at an event with an open bar. I felt cute, and one of your cuts came on my playlist, so </strong><strong>I decided to record myself on my Instagram stories dancing in the mirror under the blue light in my bathroom [for you]. In the morning, I read her reply: “So the bar went up!” I have no shame, and it’s always a sweet reminder that you are very much active in a way that works for you online.</strong></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>I value social media as a form of communication, but I also don’t feel the need to be on it all the time. In terms of this hiatus, I actually wanted to read and study for part of that time. I wanted to give myself time to think about these things and talk about them with the people in my life. I didn’t have a lot to share in those moments. I think it was better for me to listen. I need to take some time to figure out how everything I was learning was operating for me to get clear on what I was internalising and what was actually fully outside of me.</span></p><blockquote>
<p>“This feeling of expansiveness is what I’m trying to give my people, and that’s what is at the centre of all this for me” - Kelela</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>While conversations about racism tend to focus on systems of oppression and society at large, colourism is a familial issue. Colourism dictates who we love and how we love them. It takes an uncommon amount of courage to talk about colourism in any room because it’s not only white people who are colourists. Black people and people of colour have innovated on this very specific form of anti-Blackness as well. I’m eager to ask you how colourism impacts you as an artist and how you are seeing it play out specifically in the music industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>Out of all the creative industries, I would say that music feels like one of the most democratised industries because of the power of the audi-ence. However, there are people in the industry who control what the audience is even able to engage with. Because colourism exists within those ‘power players’ and also within the minds of the audience, it makes it so that everyone is a little bit less interested in somebody who has darker skin. So it looks like me having to do more. Whether that’s doing the most with live shows and fashion [in addition to the music] in order to reach the same milestones that the light-skinned girls are really just able to breeze through. And it’s been that way since the beginning of my career. And because colourism and internalised misogynoir are also present, if I express those observations, I can be seen as just being bitter about my results as an artist. So at the end of the day, there’s a way that I have been forced to internalise those feelings by thinking, ‘Oh, I need to work harder. I need to do more.’</span></p>
<p><strong>You cannot outwork colourism. You can’t outwork misogynoir. Misogynoir determines Black women’s worth long before we sit down at the negotiation table. As artists who carry historically marginalised identities, our strength is in building better communities and partnerships with each other. What was the response to those letters that featured direct </strong><strong>asks, like, “How are you creating a more equitable environment for people of colour, especially Black people? How many Black people are in positions of power at the company besides yourself? What about dark-skinned femmes? Or gender non-conforming people and those with disabilities?”</strong></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>[People] shared with me that they were initially really put off by the letters. And then they reread them. They had to keep rereading it to really digest what I was saying and get past their initial reactions. Everyone seemed to be responsive on paper. However, I’m no longer at IMG. I’m no longer with my business manager. And, through the letter, I have been able to be released from my [publishing] contract with Sony. It’s an act of self-care. It’s just something that makes me feel more healthy and in alignment with my values. Ultimately I’m working to be in alignment with myself. What that has looked like for me is speaking up to make sure I’m in partnership with Black people. Over the last three or four years, I have also been paying attention to the ways that Black people are gatekeepers. I don’t want to be what one of my friends and I call ‘the only ones’. The goal is to look around and see more of us, not less. While I was writing this music, I was listening to The will to change by bell hooks. A thread in a lot of my work right now is my experience with misogynoir. While all of this was happening, I had also hit a real hard wall with men. I needed some renewal. I don’t want a Black Liberation movement without as many Black people as possible. I care about these people in my life but I have just been so disappointed by so many men as friends, family members, in professional partnerships and as lovers. I’m saying I don’t care and just yelling and leaving it there. But I do care. When I go to the music to write, I find out what I’m actually feeling about something. Because I come to my music candidly, I would step back and it was apparent to me that I was expressing being completely over experiencing a sense of dissatisfaction. Even in the longing, there’s still something that’s not being reciprocated.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>I love sending you memes from fans like me begging you to bless our speakers with some new beats and vocals. I must admit, one of the dopest parts about spending time with you is being in earshot of you singing to yourself. </strong><strong>I hear your influence in a lot of the music I’ve been listening to. When it comes to current popular Black music, we are sonically living in the future that you’ve imagined for us.</strong></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>It’s such a beautiful feeling. I’m just gonna sit in that. I know that you mean it, and I think that’s why it feels so good. It also resonates with me and the work that I know I put in, and how isolated I’ve always felt in this space as a Black femme artist in dance music. When I came into the space, it wasn’t giving the amount of variety that we have right now. I’m experiencing so much relief around that because there are so many Black artists who have filled in this space. It was not giving that six or even eight years ago. Now, it feels so very sweet receiving these words and also having the experience of listening to other people’s music and hearing the influence. It’s exciting. I also feel like this moment in music is the result of the 2020 [<a href="/tag/black-lives-matter">Black Lives Matter</a>] uprisings. It feels like a lot of people letting go of their internalised homophobia and racism. You know, just letting go of a lot of bullshit we have been taught to believe about ourselves for decades. White people didn’t change much. But n***as! Black people! We’re doing the work of expanding. I witnessed my peers and myself actually allowing ourselves to get sick of the shit. Giving ourselves permission to feel more emboldened and more unruly and vehement. And that is where I think a lot of the power of the last few years lies. We’re in this moment where a lot of people are wanting</span><span> </span><span>to make dance music; there are people who feel inspired by it and people who are ready to receive and embrace it. I think that’s a result of us starting to reckon </span><span>with the self. There are a lot of implications for historically marginalised artists with big-name artists wanting to make electronic dance music. My hope is that it leads </span><span>to something concrete for dance music and the historically under-resourced artists who are and have been making dance music. I want more people to develop a sense of pride in the artform as a whole. For me, that’s a really important thing. Because Black dance music is a healing knowledge, you know?</span></p>
<p><strong>When this article comes out, your new single will have just been released. How would you describe this song?</strong></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>“Washed Away” is a heart check-in. I think it’s important to me to start with a real check-in, like, how’s everybody really doing? Rather than coming out the gate on a party tip!</span></p><blockquote>
<p>“‘Washed Away’ is a heart check-in... It’s like a baptism, it makes me think about all that we’ve collectively been through. There’s hope in it” - Kelela</p>
</blockquote><p><strong>But it wouldn’t be a Kelela takeover without the party tip popping out too! We will be dancing and crying!</strong></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>There are a lot of moments where I’m just improvising on the song. And I started thinking about why. Where is this coming from? Why am I saying, “Far away. Washed away”? And it just feels like a cleanse. It’s like a baptism for me, and it makes me think about all that we’ve collectively been through. That’s the feeling, and it gives me a sense of triumph having made it through. There’s hope in it. I was talking with my friend about what this music feels like. I want to send out a clear message to Black people, who are my core audience and who I intend this music for, that you n***as are worthy. This time away has shown me that I have been very slowly building my world [the whole time]. Which is funny, because I feel like the dominant music business framework says that, if you go away, people will forget you. For me, it feels like the opposite. Because the way that I’ve been consistently vulnerable in sharing my real self through my art has kept me present with my audience. Over this time period, it’s almost like the volume has turned up. The world that I’m building has been made apparent through these memes and tweets and other expressions online, where people are either making a joke or saying something really sincere about me and my work. The undercurrent to it all is that they remember, and it’s based on a value system that’s rooted in being part of a club where everybody wears their hearts on their sleeves. It’s very smart in a way that is specific to queerness. A type of queer commentary where you are seen even in the margins. It’s loaded with knowledge that holds a special kind of tenderness and holistic consideration. I can only know what I’ve built through these types of responses and feedback. I am being made aware of the type of world that I’m building because my audience is giving the thing back to me. It feels like it's coming from such an honest place and not a trendy one.</span></p>
<p><strong>Your music and visuals are made possible through the radical imagination of Blackness. I’ve watched one of those clips you sent over to me, and it has a feeling of... how the hell did you do this? What strain of weed is this?!</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>K:</strong> I’ll frame it like this – there are the aesthetics of Afrofuturism, and then there are the actual feelings, experiences and politics of Afrofuturism. We are building our relationship with visual and narrative signifiers through these images. For me, the end result is creating images that make Black people feel like we are actually this big! That we are worthy, and this is how large and expansive it can get. This feeling of expansiveness is what I’m trying to give my people, and that’s what is at the centre of all of this for me. I’ve never really named that framework in that way. But I think it’s an ethic I’ve been really striving for this whole time. I’m grateful to have been building this out over time, especially through the music I will be putting out. I like pairing the music with a visual language that produces a catharsis for Black fans specifically. It can work for all marginalised people if it works for us, but I’m really thinking about us.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>I’m so excited for Kelela fans and the people who will get to experience your work for</strong><br /><strong>the first time in an age of accessible social commentary and music history because of how lovers of music keep expanding their use of technologies like TikTok. We deserve to </strong><strong>feel all of it. The anger, the dancing, the pleasure and the love that is housed in Black creative practices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong> Yes! It’s time for us to dance. For everyone else, it’s not vibes right now. It’s clean-up time! The fact that they get to listen to some cute music should really be enough. But stand on the edge!</p>
<p><strong>Beam us up, Kelela!</strong></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Save the Green Planet! Why Ari Aster is remaking a Korean sci-fi comedy</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Nick Chen delves into the rumours that the American director is redoing Jang Joon-hwan’s 2003 sci-fi comedy about alien conspiracy theories</h3>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">When<span> </span><em>Titanic</em><span> </span>was a monster hit in 1997, it spawned a star in Leonardo DiCaprio – and also a monster rumour. In response to<span> </span><em>Titanic</em>, an anti-Leonardo DiCaprio website declared that the actor is actually an alien who’s attempting to conquer Earth by having sex with the planet’s female population. In 2022, the blog post no longer exists, nor does the original conspiracy theory (we now know that DiCaprio wouldn’t sleep with the women over 25). It did, however, inspire the South Korean filmmaker Jang Joon-hwan to write and direct<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em>, a 2003 comedy that may well become a 2024 comedy, should<span> </span><span>Ari</span><span> </span><span>Aster</span>’s remake plans come to fruition.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2020,<span> </span><span>Aster</span><span> </span>and Lars Knudsen announced that their production company, Square Peg, are collaborating with CJ Entertainment, the studio behind<span> </span><em>Parasite</em>, to redo<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>for modern audiences. According to the press release, Jang will direct from a script penned by<span> </span><em>Succession</em><span> </span>writer Will Tracy, and, per<span> </span><span>Aster</span>’s words, the updated, US-set version will “reflect the mess of the world today”. Could it star DiCaprio as an alleged alien? Perhaps Cousin Greg? Two years on, we’re still waiting for an update.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">In the meantime, Jang’s original<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>is a riotous genre mashup worth your time. Accompanied by a punk cover of “Over the Rainbow”, the opening credits establish what’s to follow: a raucous send-up of movie tropes. Here, the DiCaprio figure is Kang Man-shik (Yun-shik Baek), a wealthy, suited CEO who’s captured by Lee Byeong-gu (Shin Ha-gyun), an incel-ish beekeeper who’s convinced that Kang is an extra-terrestrial from the planet Andromeda. If Lee is correct, Kang’s fellow Andromedans are planning to exterminate the human race in order to save planet Earth from the humans themselves. Thus the underlying gag: even within Lee’s logic, mankind is the global-warming, in-fighting bad guys.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">What distinguishes<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>from, say, any other kooky caper theorising that wealthy businessmen are secret Martians is Jang’s scattershot approach to tone. One scene may be an achingly sincere, dialogue-driven revelation about Lee’s tragic background, the next could be an animated,<span> </span><em>2001</em>-referencing flashback featuring dinosaurs or a musical interlude involving Lee’s circus-performing girlfriend. Interspersed throughout, too, is a jarringly gritty subplot about the detectives who suspect Lee of the kidnapping. By the time a swarm of bees commit a cinematic, giallo-style murder, you half-wonder if Jang is treating the movie as a showreel for his versatility.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Even then, nothing can prepare viewers for the detour into torture porn. Imprisoned by Lee, Kang is tied up and experimented on, his three weak points supposedly being his feet, his eyes, and between his legs. With Kang shaved, electrocuted, and repeatedly interrogated about his UFO philosophy (which he denies through tears of pain), it’s apparent we’ve witnessed this dynamic before, just in reverse. In an interview with<span> </span><em><a href="https://www.villagevoice.com/2005/04/12/leo-dicaprio-alien-seductor-so-says-director-jang-jun-hwan/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.villagevoice.com/2005/04/12/leo-dicaprio-alien-seductor-so-says-director-jang-jun-hwan/amp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663757764532000amp;usg=AOvVaw3hrOxoBkzS5T9zLl7RZ3Yv">The Village Voice</a></em>, Jang cited two core ideas: “this anti-DiCaprio website” and retelling<span> </span><em>Misery<span> </span></em>from the kidnapper’s point of view.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="4Q4-rfJbxA8"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Q4-rfJbxA8" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p style="font-weight: 400;">Unsurprisingly,<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>was a box-office flop, both in South Korea and overseas. Sympathising with an antihero? In 2003? On<span> </span><em>this</em><span> </span>planet? But any fan of<span> </span><span>Aster</span>’s films should be open-minded. Take<span> </span><em>Hereditary</em>, a global hit starring Toni Collette as a mother who tells her son, “All I get back is that fucking face on your face.” Or<span> </span><em>Midsommar</em>, a relationship drama that has the audience cheering when Florence Pugh’s Dani opts to watch her boyfriend burn alive.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, in a 2019<span> </span><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/ari-aster-movies-inspired-midsommar/sgp/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.indiewire.com/gallery/ari-aster-movies-inspired-midsommar/sgp/amp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663757764532000amp;usg=AOvVaw1N4aJYVMhWtCzkM1dT3_iw"><em>IndieWire</em> feature</a>,<span> </span><span>Aster</span><span> </span>specifically named<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>as the top inspiration for<span> </span><em>Midsommar</em>’s jaw-dropping conclusion. He elaborated, “There are so many South Korean films that have come out in the last 20 years… I love how they juggle tones.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Like<span> </span><span>Aster</span>’s two released features (and, allegedly, his upcoming<span> </span><em>Disappointment Blvd.</em>),<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>is a gory, messed-up, all-out genre extravaganza with family trauma at its heart. In homemade protection gear that’s a slightly more advanced version of wrapping himself up in aluminium foil, Lee looks comically absurd – more<span> </span><em>SNL</em><span> </span>than Spielberg. But Shin imbues so much earnestness into the ridiculous dialogue, you go along with the mayhem. And, sure, Lee’s sob story is surrounded by so much silliness it doesn’t quite resonate like Dani losing her parents and sister before<span> </span><em>Midsommar’s</em><span> </span>opening credits, but it does explain a method to the film’s madness.</p>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330317.jpg" alt="Save the Green Planet!, 2003" />		<figcaption>

	</figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kang owns Yuje Chemicals, and Lee’s mother, an employee at the pharmaceutical company, was poisoned and has been comatose for years. Moreover, Lee was beaten by school teachers, his father was abusive, and in a prison stint he was further assaulted. To ease the pain, Lee turned to conspiracy theories. Back then, there was no Joe Rogan podcast, so he went for the next best thing: choosing to believe that the man responsible for his mother’s impending death is a UFO.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps, then,<span> </span><em>Save the Green Planet!</em><span> </span>really does require a modern update. In 2003, writing online that DiCaprio is a dangerously sexy extra-terrestrial was a funny goof; today, it could be the latest tweet from QAnon. And, if DiCaprio is involved in the new version, the actor could bring it full circle to his<span> </span><em>Titanic</em><span> </span>days, satirising the alien-like nature of celebrity and the self-congratulatory element of his<span> </span><em>Don’t Look Up<span> </span></em>press tour. Besides, a remake may seem illogical, but so did the original film. As<span> </span><span>Aster</span><span> </span>noted when introducing Jang’s sci-fi at a 2019<span> </span><a href="https://www.theculturefiles.com/must-see-films-film-at-lincoln-center-relentless-invention-new-korean-cinema/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theculturefiles.com/must-see-films-film-at-lincoln-center-relentless-invention-new-korean-cinema/amp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663757764532000amp;usg=AOvVaw3J2tJe91m61eXur3xY9yeg">repertory screening</a>, “This is a movie that should not work but does really beautifully.”</p>]]>

Back at the Old Selfridges Hotel for Stefan Cooke’s SS23 collection, mundane travel announcements from South Western Railways bled into a stomach-soaring remix of Carly Rae Jepsen’s “Cut To The Feeling”, as Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt introduced their first fully-realised womenswear offering. Pushing the twee – and the cheesy – into something that felt both silly and sophisticated, the design duo offered buttock-grazing miniskirts with ruffled hems, long-sleeve polos mangled with skew-whiff buttons, and zip-up tabard dresses worn over ankle-grazing trousers, while taffeta bows made a tactile surface across skin-tight tops and cocktail dresses. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Cris Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

It was “ruined preppiness”, “impulsive”, “uptown, made for living,” as the show notes read, but it was the word “value” that came before anything else. The value of a shit gay club anthem, the value of a charity shop t-shirt, which had been decked in in translucent paillettes. Elsewhere, men’s pieces comprised panelled denim skirts, inspired by padded military jackets, burnt devor#233; trousers, and heritage scarves stiffened into straps and belts. Ribbon cummerbunds gave a slight peplum effect when worn over jeans, and silk bomber jackets transformed images of the brand’s bags and buttons into equestrian, Herm#232;s-style prints. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Cris Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

This season, the designers abandoned their beloved cut-out knitwear, stamping argyle patterns across penny loafers and creamy zip-up jackets in a new articulation of their signature motif. The whole thing was something of a full-circle moment for Burt – who studied womenswear at university – making the brand’s venture into dressmaking just as confident as its menswear proposal. As with Peter Do and Simone Rocha, though, who bolstered their co-ed offerings for SS23, plenty of these pieces could be shared and swapped between wardrobes: just how far these lines will cross remains to be seen. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Cris Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

<h1 class="fl-title">Lil Nas X buys pizza for a bunch of homophobic protestors</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The rapper has taught his haters a thing or two about Christian virtues</h3>

	<figure>

<p><span>When homophobic Christians tried to picket his show, <a href="/tag/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a> responded much like Jesus himself would: with kindness.</span></p>
<p><span>Ahead of playing a gig at the MGM Musical Hall in Boston last Sunday, the rapper tweeted a video of a small group of Christian protesters across the street from the venue entrance, with signs reading stuff like “Jesus is God, even demons know it” and “Repent and believe the gospel.” In the face of this provocation, however, Lil Nas X remained characteristically unphased, <a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1571652392688713728?s=20amp;t=icqIUIe_VpbF_rSQ_oe3FA">tweeting</a>, “I just told my team to send them pizza, this is really good promo!”</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">update: they didn’t want the pizza but i accidentally fell in love with one of the homophobic protestors <a href="https://t.co/5vPAw0XlIr">https://t.co/5vPAw0XlIr</a> <a href="https://t.co/vlAsnZwcAD">pic.twitter.com/vlAsnZwcAD</a></p>mdash; SAFFA (@LilNasX) <a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1571705653550321666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2022</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p><span>Sadly, this olive branch was rebuffed. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1571705653550321666?s=20amp;t=icqIUIe_VpbF_rSQ_oe3FA">follow-up video,</a> one of the protesters rejected the pizza, saying “we thank you, we appreciate it, but no thank you.” Not very Christian! But never one to miss the opportunity for a spot of tomfoolery, Lil Nas X announced that he had fallen in love with one of the protesters, zooming in on the man and overlaying the video with Sufjan Steven’s “Mystery of Love” from the <em>Call Me By Your Name</em> soundtrack. Later that night, he <a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1571936699428769792?s=20amp;t=icqIUIe_VpbF_rSQ_oe3FA">tweeted</a></span><span> “can’t stop thinking about the cute homophobic guy that was protesting my concert last night. i just know we had a connection. i miss him so much man. i’m nothing without him”</span></p>
<p><span>Evangelical Christians have been gunning for Lil Nas X for a while: not only he is a gay Black man, but his cheerfully blasphemous video for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6swmTBVI83k">MONTERO (Call Be Your Name)”</a> (in which Hill rides a stripper pole to hell and gives the devil a lap-dance) sparked a full-blown </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/22356438/lil-nas-x-satan-shoes-nike-montero-video-gay-agenda-christian-controversy"><span>Satanic panic</span></a><span> last year. The narrative that he was an agent of the antichrist only gained traction when he released a limited edition pair of <a href="/fashion/article/52330/1/call-me-by-your-pain-montero-lil-nas-x-drops-sneaker-made-from-human-blood">custom Nike trainers,</a> dubbed “Satan Shoes”, which each contained a drop of human blood. Right-wing pundits across the US rushed to condemn him as an evil influence. But with this latest pizza stunt, Lil Nas x has embodied the Christian virtues of turning the other cheek, feeding the hungry (or at least trying to), and forgiving the haters. Can those trying to demonise him say the same?</span></p>

In the basement of a hollowed-out car park in London’s Kings Cross on Friday night, models stomped. Techno crashing overhead, rakish women with glitter splattered onto their head wore flowery mesh tops, cropped and battered biker jackets, bias-cut dresses, fluttery club-ready slips, and eyelet-strewn mini skirts.			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Morgane Maurice</span>		</figcaption>

Acid wash trench coats, sinuous two pieces, and flared semi-sheer trousers, Charlotte Knowles and Alexandre Arsenault didn’t venture too far from their now-well established staples – where everything comes peek-a-boo, low-slung, shrunken, and held-up by intricate systems of strings – reimagining the Y2K princess as some kind of inner-city savage. Though all eyes zoned-in on Alva Claire when she emerged in a spaghetti-strapped, denim-effect patchwork dress, the KNWLS women rarely went beyond sample size, despite the intimacy with which the label works with the body. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Morgane Maurice</span>		</figcaption>

Alongside the brand’s signature RAZR bags, came a slew of freakish footwear: square-toed UGG heels, which were the lovechild of Lulu Kennedy’s latest XLNC incubator, which awards Fashion East graduates with investment and mentorship. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Morgane Maurice</span>		</figcaption>

<p><span>When you step off the plane, arrive at a new destination, and the veil of night is slowly being pulled across the sky, the new morning often feels like an experience that awakens a part of you that had been sleeping before. The night before the morning after, <a href="/tag/burna-boy">Burna Boy</a> headlined Tipsy, one of Barbados’s premier soca festivals</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>and today, it really does feel good to feel the grass beneath your feet.</span></p>
<p><span>All it took was 24 hours in Bridgetown for the boy out of Port Harcourt, Nigeria to realise he dreamed of one day owning a house a stone’s throw from <a href="/tag/rihanna">Rihanna</a>’s family home on the island’s prestigious Sandy Lane. It wasn’t the palm tree-lined boulevards that swayed him, but the view out onto the vast nothingness of the Caribbean Sea. “I could really live here one day, I might have to make it happen,” he says.</span></p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><span>It made sense as I looked out on to the ocean from his villa. Confronted with such a view, all of the meaningless things in life we worry about daily fall away like dead leaves in the autumn. Here, there are no debates about which sound Burna is inspired by or the incessant churn of the digital rumour mill. Just stillness, and a beautiful quiet.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no easy way to write a profile on a man who is as enigmatic as he is charismatic. The truth he gives you has to be taken at face value, no matter your perceptions. Access to artists in contemporary music journalism is much more controlled and guarded in today’s media landscape. He laughs as he says that interviews tend to be a lose-lose situation most of the time: “Whatever I say, even if it’s the truth, you guys will spin it.”</span></p>
<p><span>An artist’s journey to peace isn’t a straight road, perhaps even less so for someone of Burna’s status. In an <a href="/tag/afrobeats">Afrobeats</a>-fusion sense, he is unquestionably a legacy artist, but to the wider world, it was 2018’s <em>Outside</em> and especially <em>African Giant</em> (2019) which propelled him into a higher stratosphere. But if you asked anyone in the dance ten years ago, you knew the time was coming, just not when.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="421w1j87fEM"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/421w1j87fEM" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>The villa the musician is staying at during his short time on the island feels a world away from the rest of Bridgetown; this is a place where you truly come to play and relax. The drive up around the winding private roads of Sandy Lane offers a sense of peace, which Burna Boy suggests is what he wants and needs. </span><span>The ocean feels endlessly wide and deep enough for all the bullshit to sink in.</span></p>
<p><span>For someone only recently arrived at the cusp of global stardom, Burna Boy is already fed up with this aspect of the business. This is not news, and he’s made it clear in the past that he’s not fond of interviews. The way he sees it, his new album, </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love,_Damini"><em>Love, Damini</em></a><span>, offers a more graceful window into his mind. “I tried to use this album to allow people to get closer to me,” he says.</span></p><p><span>Burna’s fanbase has been growing for over a decade now. Someone joked on Twitter that he was the Thanos of Afrobeats</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>not because he’s a galactic despot, but because, like the Marvel character, Burna was teased for years to a mainstream audience, before </span><em>Outside</em><span> established him as a titan of the genre</span><strong><em>. </em></strong><span>It was an added bonus that the project featured two enduring hits with “Ye” and “Sekkle Down”, the latter featuring regular collaborator J Hus, who helped introduce him to UK audiences.</span></p>
<p><span>The night before we sit down to chat, Burna Boy’s first visit to a Caribbean island had been a big success. Much has been made of Afrobeats vying for supremacy with dancehall, but these reductive and often asinine arguments fail to acknowledge how Black music moves across borders, especially in the internet age. These exchanges existed long before dancehall and Afrobeats, and have done so since the movement and displacement of Black people from Africa. At this point, Burna Boy’s name is being used as cannon fodder for an issue that quite simply doesn’t really exist. Still, Burna’s appearance at Tipsy was a moment of celebration for all those in attendance. If Burna was looking for reasons as to why he does this, he found them in the festival crowd’s euphoric response; “Last Last” was reloaded five times before he continued to perform the whole song. If that’s not telling of the global influence of his music, I’m not sure what is.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>Back at Burna’s villa, a bit of conversational chess is required to break the ice. The musician looks composed, though his experiences with the media of late haven’t exactly been positive: there’s been a lot of contortion as to what he has and hasn’t said. It begins lightly. “This album was coming from a personal standpoint, and it was about me, d’you understand?” he explains. “Me talking to myself and in the process talking to you. It’s probably one of my most important [statements] because it felt like I was in school writing something and putting it in a time capsule.”</span></p>
<p><span>Burna Boy’s audience is so broad, globally speaking, that even his fans haven’t yet come to an agreement over what his music is inspired by</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>even when he’s been open and transparent on the subject. He’s referred to himself as an ‘African giant’</span><strong> </strong><span>on multiple occasions; symbolically, it has an empowering effect and, if anything, it’s not to be taken as something political. Just this summer, police escorts attached to the singer were charged with attempted murder after shooting two people at a Lagos nightclub. His camp hasn’t responded to claims from a woman who was with the victims that the altercation was escalated by the security detail. But Burna Boy has never been shy about his life and what goes on in it: indeed, he touches on his prison time when he lived in the UK during our conversation. He says that the public can decide who he is because Burna Boy, by all accounts, has come to terms with his own mortality.</span></p>
<p><span>“I tend to be misunderstood and the reason why is because I’ve never really given anyone a chance to know who I am, and that’s what I tried to do,” he explains. For his new record, that all changed; on the closing title track, for example, he delivers a heartfelt ode to the people who have been influential in his life, while reckoning with some of his own demons. “This is just how I cry, I don’t know how else to do it and that’s how it’s always been,” he says of the track. As Burna suggests, <em>Love, Damini</em> is the singer’s most honest account of his life to date; he’s not interested in giving us a rose-tinted portrait. “I’ve got to the point where I don’t even care. Whoever it’s meant is who it’s meant for,” Burna says with the naturally laid-back cadence of a true Nigerian, his accent suddenly at its thickest. He’s much more comfortable than he was 15 minutes ago.</span></p><p><span>In the dining room of the villa, he sits at the head of the table, wearing a Boston Celtics jersey. Naturally, I shift the conversation towards the NBA. Burna tells me he considers Greek-Nigerian player <a href="https://www.instagram.com/giannis_an34/?hl=en">Giannis Antetokounmpo</a> an African giant also. Antetokounmpo, who has expressed strong pride in his Nigerian roots, had his surname changed from Adetokunbo by Greek authorities on his arrival to Europe as a young child. Now, he’s an NBA champion and two-time MVP, an example of the same unstoppable will to succeed as Burna.</span></p>
<p><span>On the intro monologue to another track on the album, “Whiskey”, a Port Harcourt resident speaks candidly about the pollution suffocating the city, which is Nigeria’s oil capital. Burna talks softly about people drinking milk as it’s believed to help reduce the impact of the soot from oil pollution in the air. “There’s no exaggeration in the song</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>the air is black, everything is dark because of oil and gas. That’s what this album is, it’s a really personal album as a human being.”</span></p>
<p><span>Moments before I arrive, Burna sits at the head of the table with his boys, smoking, talking and taking his surroundings in. If anything, Burna imagines a world where he doesn’t have to address sociopolitical issues in his music. While he’s still very much wedded to his hometown, as he reckons with his past on </span><em>Love, Damini, </em><span>he’s also clearing room for a new, illuminating future. Besides, he’s already played a crucial and monumental role in creating clear pathways between Afrobeats and dancehall, learning from those that came before to help guide global Black music into an unmapped tomorrow.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>Burna Boy stresses that he doesn’t want to be considered political anymore, and never really wanted to in the first place. If anything, Burna Boy may be better described as an antihero within the global conversation of Afro-fusion and Afrobeats, and there are many shades to his interior world</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>some more enviable than others. “My thoughts don’t matter around that,” he says, when asked about <a href="/politics/article/52908/1/nigeria-now-end-sars-activism-summer-2021">#EndSARS</a> and 2020’s uprising of young Nigerians against police corruption. “Nothing is going to change. It just is what is… I’m not going to encourage any young people to lose their lives senselessly anymore, d’you understand? When something is ready to happen, it will happen. I understand that now. You can’t jump into something that you don’t fully understand, even with our country. With understanding comes readiness for action.”</span></p>
<p><span>After we’re briefly interrupted by the chef reading out the lunch menu, Burna Boy jokes that he can’t wait to see how people, and the media specifically, spin what he just said. When the protests were unfolding in 2020, Burna called them “the most important moment in Nigeria’s history”</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>but two years on, it’s truly hit home that the comparisons with his idol, Afrobeat pioneer and political activist Fela Kuti, will always be a disservice, because of how the role and perception of an artist have changed since the height of his popularity in the 1970s. Burna Boy is now much more concerned with working quietly and speaking his truth. “The only time it matters for me to tell my truth is in my music; otherwise it just gives people more to misunderstand or turn into entertainment.”</span></p>
<p><span>The release of the album, Burna’s sixth to date, was timed around his 31st birthday celebrations</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>for him, an opportunity for reflection. “Track one [“Glory”] and the outro [from the album], they’re really letters to my future and past selves,” he confesses. “I’m shedding light on personal things that I haven’t really touched on before,” he says. At this point in his career, Burna doesn’t have to be bold in his approach to crafting a thematic album, but it’s arguably his most well-received project in recent years. The universally loved “Last Last”</span><strong> </strong><span>is reflective of the artist’s success recently;</span><strong> </strong><span>Burna’s melodies hit harder backlit with deeply personal insight like this. Still, it’s a daring strategy to use a Toni Braxton sample from a song about ‘ain’t-shit’ men and find a way to make it hit.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="7WU__JQuB8g"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WU__JQuB8g" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>As time passes in our meeting, Burna Boy lets his guard down a little; on occasion, you can even see the sparkle in the smile (sometimes quite literally</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>he has a couple of gems decorating his teeth). An artist like him doesn’t get to where he is without a level of charisma that can hold an entire festival, let alone a room. In those small pockets of time, where that sparkle shines, he seems to find some peace.</span></p>
<p><span>From our brief time together today, it’s clear that how Burna presents himself publicly is his authentic self. If the past couple of years have taught him anything, it’s that joy and peace are paramount</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>and that the pursuit of it is a lifelong journey worth taking. “My music will be here long after I’m gone, even after my children’s children’s children. It’s a stamp in time for those who have a reality like mine,” Burna Boy says. “That’s what I care about.”</span></p>
<p><span>Burna Boy believes that legacy is important, especially in light of what he’s already achieved with his music (“Afrofusion started in a treehouse in Port Harcourt, so you never know where it’ll be tomorrow”). He thinks about death a lot, and what you leave behind as an artist. “Everyone will move the fuck on when I die,” he says. “This will be OK without me.” And after a conversation about life with someone he’d never met before, in a setting he’s not entirely comfortable being in, Burna Boy is as open, and existential, as he gets. The grea</span>t <span>beyond powers his music</span><span> </span><span>–</span><span> </span><span>and he’s not about to spoil the ride.</span></p><p><em>H<span>air </span><span>JASMINE DALE</span><span>, make-up </span><span>MARIE BRUCE </span><span>using </span><span>CLÉ DE PEAU BEAUTÉ</span><span>, barber </span><span>ADAM HONEYGHAN</span><span>, nails </span><span>SIMONE CUMMINGS </span><span>at </span><span>CLM</span><span>, set design </span><span>MAX RANDALL</span><span>, photographic assistants </span><span>FELIX TW</span><span>, </span><span>LEWIS ROBINSON</span><span>, styling assistants </span><span>FELIX PARADZA</span><span>, </span><span>ANDRA-AMELIA BUHAI</span><span>, </span><span>EMILY JONES</span><span>, </span><span>EMILY GLEESON</span><span>, </span><span>ARIELLE NEUHAUS GOLD</span><span>, digital operator </span><span>NEIL BENNETT</span><span>, set design assistant </span><span>GRACE SNELLOCK</span><span>, production 360PM</span></em></p>]]>

<p><span>By now, we’re all familiar with the relentless cycle of trends that are infiltrating the internet – and our minds. From</span><span> </span><a href="/fashion/article/54621/1/fashion-sex-appeal-sexy-y2k-revival-blumarine-versace-nostalgia-tiktok-butterfly"><span>Y2K</span></a><span> to </span><a href="/fashion/article/54603/1/wtf-is-indie-sleaze-comeback-tiktok-trend-y2k-chanel-saint-laurent-cobrasnake"><span>Indie Sleaze</span></a><span>, we’ve experienced an endless rehashing of old aesthetics repackaged in TikTok-friendly formats and hailed by online commentators as the Next Big Thing. With the mid-aughts making a comeback in terms of </span><a href="/music/article/56708/1/why-indie-music-should-stay-in-the-00s-the-kooks-sleaze-strokes"><span>indie music</span></a><span>, Tumblr aesthetics and the emo revival, we find ourselves thinking: what’s next? </span></p>
<p><span>To answer that question, we need to dial back to a time when technology, and its advancement, felt like it had real revolutionary potential. </span><span>As capitalism swallows itself and any chance of a future beyond it, it’s easy to feel like the Future = Bad. But this doesn’t get to the root of our collective angst, nor does it help us move forward. Perhaps what we need is something so based and cringe that we can’t help but put our obsession with the past to bed – a nail in the coffin, if you will.</span></p>
<p><span>As one of the last remaining 2010s subcultures to not be put through the cultural ringer, steampunk should be set to make a return in our nostalgia economy, but why hasn’t it? The hashtag #steampunk currently has 460 million views on TikTok, so there’s clearly a growing interest, with users showing off images of </span><span>coal-powered flying boats and get-ready-with-me’s featuring period-appropriate attire such as bustles, corsets and petticoats, not to mention accessories spanning clocks, cogs, parasols and aviation goggles. But, aside from an (apparently) promising online presence, the subculture has yet to take on any noticeable cultural relevance, bar the occasional nod by PC Music affiliates </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiOds6Lu9Y6/"><span>Dorian Electra</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/music/article/55747/1/pc-musics-umru-is-lvling-up-on-his-ep-comfort-noise"><span>umru</span></a><span>. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>Steampunk was first coined by writer K.W. Jeter in 1987 to describe a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates 19th-century aesthetics and retrofuturist technology inspired by the sort of fictional machines you’d find in an HG Wells or Jules Verne novel. But the term now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s. For example, steampunk imagery can be seen in films such as Hayao Miyazaki’s </span><em><span>Future Boy Conan</span></em><span> (1978) and</span><span> </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_in_the_Sky"><em><span>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</span></em></a><span> </span><span>(1986), which imagine a fantastical version of old industrial Europe inhabited by airships, air pirates and steam-powered robots.</span></p>
<p><span>Yet, as far as the mainstream goes, steampunk doesn’t exist – and if it does, it’s considered deeply uncool, triggering the same eye-rolling disdain as the mention of Disney adults, electro-swing and trilbies. Synonymous with middle-aged couples in nondescript British towns, barbershop quartets and Doctor Who enthusiasts, there’s a sincerity to the subculture that has yet to pass the threshold into irony. </span></p>
<p><span>That said, the last few years has seen a reclaiming of all things considered un-aesthetic, whether that’s the messy maximalism of </span><a href="/life-culture/article/56132/1/cute-trend-drain-hang-bladee-marc-jacobs-heaven"><span>cutecore</span></a><span> or the </span><a href="/fashion/article/56534/1/ketamin-heroin-chic-subculture-fashion-trends-scene-kid-memes-tumblr-minions"><span>chaotic and meme-inspired</span></a><span> fashion championed by the likes of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jameswallaceonline/?hl=en-gb"><span>James Wallace</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/25fnyc/"><span>25FNYC</span></a><span> (Wallace recently posted an Instagram story on @fakegucciwatch account, signalling the possibility of a steampunk-themed collection). Surely if despicable Minions and Shrek can find new life as garments worn by Extremely Online edgelords, it’s not too far a stretch to imagine steampunk catching on? Elsewhere, remix culture has spawned a generation of cultural contrarians who splice up nostalgic sounds as a way of reinventing the familiar, mixing together (typically) low and high culture sounds for maximum impact. Think: eurodance and happy hardcore combined with progressive techno and orchestral samples.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="8ykEy-yPBFc"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ykEy-yPBFc" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Saying this, there are a few potential red flags. Typical of any subculture that glorifies the Victorian era, there are bound to be some imperial undertones, whether intentional or not. </span><span>At annual steampunk gatherings such as the Weekend at the Asylum in Lincoln, enthusiasts sip on gin and dance along to choirs singing about the joys of English breakfast tea. It’s this nostalgia for a time so inextricably linked to colonialism that feels a little… naive, if not low-key sinister. The emphasis on adventuring and taking earth’s resources also seems at odds with the present, where we are all too aware of man’s disastrous impact on the natural world. </span></p>
<p><span>But, consider this: steampunk is a reimagining of Victorian speculative fiction, where </span><span>steam, not electricity, is at the forefront of technological advancement. Nowadays, we find ourselves at the forefront of another technological revolution, not one powered by steam, but by silicon. The information age has skewered our understanding of the world and how it works, as IRL experiences are replaced with computer screens and algorithms that dictate our interests. </span></p>
<p><span>Steampunk, in contrast, allows us to observe culture from the inside out. Or, as scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall </span><a href="https://steam-punk.co.uk/what-is-steampunk.html"><span>put it</span></a><span>: “the tinkering and tinker-able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll up our sleeves and get to work reshaping our contemporary world.” With ongoing threats in the form of global warming, microplastics, and the cost of living crisis (the list goes on), there’s a temptation to bury our heads in the sand and wait for it all to blow over. But that won’t fix any of our problems, only exacerbate them. Perhaps by understanding its machinations, AKA how the cogs wind up and down, we can feel more connected to the present. </span></p>
<p><span>So, to point out the obvious: steampunk isn’t back. But I wouldn’t be surprised if people started donning cogs and top hats in that post-ironic, anti-aesthetic sort of way in the coming months. Maybe Minion-mania will bring goggles into style. Or, the goth comeback will segue into neo-Victorianism, which is only a short stretch away from – you guessed it – steampunk. Whether it’ll ever become a trend IRL is yet to be seen. But if our post-pandemic apathy has taught us anything, it’s that people need something to spark their imagination – and if that’s a steam-powered zeppelin, so be it. </span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Nation of bootlickers: Why do English people love oppression?</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">From the Medieval feudal system to the present day, the English have always been happy to be ruled over</h3>

<p><span>The first English republic began with a murmured prayer, the sound of an axe falling through the air, and a collective gasp. Charles I was a textbook tyrant, whose reign came to a violent end after Parliament tried him for violating the rights of the people, found him guilty, and sentenced him to death by beheading. The monarchy was subsequently abolished in one fell swoop, making England one of the first countries in Europe to make such a radical political change. </span></p>
<p><span>But just 11 years later, Charles’ son returned from exile to sit on the throne. 360 years on from that, we’re still in the monarchy’s thrall, and have recently welcomed our third King Charles.</span></p>
<p><span>There are myriad reasons why the monarchy came back in 1661. The leader of the republic, Oliver Cromwell, was deeply unpopular – turns out banning Christmas wasn’t a great idea – but it wasn’t </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> down to him. The English actually </span>missed<span> the monarchy too. There </span><em><span>were</span></em><span> political fringe groups – namely the Diggers and the Levellers – who had the imagination to see the moment as a time for radical, egalitarian change, but they were firmly in the minority. For the most part, people wanted to reattach the king’s head to his body and go back to the way things were – even though they knew the oppressive, hierarchical system valued the lives of the masses as less important than the life of the monarch.</span></p>
<p><span>To be fair to our early modern counterparts, maybe the mid-17th century was too early for radical, revolutionary politics in Britain: the French did away with monarchy for good much later in 1848; the Bolsheviks overthrew the Tsars in 1917, the Germans forced the Kaiser to abdicate in 1918, and the Habsburg monarchy was abolished in 1918. There was no blueprint for us to follow and no real vision for what life without a king could look like back in 1649. But for us to </span><em><span>still</span></em><span> be under the monarchy’s spell in 2022? What’s our excuse now?</span></p><p><span>There seems to be something broken within the soul of the English people (and I mean </span><em><span>English</span></em><span>, because at least the other British nations aren’t quite as submissive as England). We’re a country of bootlickers: it was evident in the simpering return to monarchy in the 1660s, but it’s more evident now: in the people who said we should stop picking on </span><a href="https://twitter.com/felicit75099581/status/1529874665430298624?s=20amp;t=I2x6Q9V7TO4OFSGkPq3xfQ"><span>Boris Johnson</span></a><span> for breaking his own lockdown rules; people shunning worker solidarity in favour of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/briony_turner/status/1194260746395430912?s=20amp;t=3bzKoc-5m1H7PhyRmqN8mg"><span>arguing</span></a><span> that everyone else’s pay should be as meagre as theirs; people asserting that you </span><a href="https://twitter.com/AdamBarrow15/status/1429895913766592515?s=20amp;t=zH4AnkyYSLvJ5sCvMXtd3Q"><span>shouldn’t have had kids</span></a><span> in the first place if you were going to end up using a food bank. It’s most obvious in the refrain so often levelled at anyone who dares criticise this sceptred isle – “if you don’t like it, why don’t you just leave?” – a question which serves to stifle any meaningful discussion about the possibility of things getting better in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Dr <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tabitha-a-baker-404370109/?originalSubdomain=uk">Tabitha Baker</a>, a lecturer in political psychology at Bournemouth University, it’s possible that the English really do enjoy suffering, which can occlude the possibility of us coming together in solidarity. “Some argue there is a pleasure in suffering. Fintan O’Toole calls this a sadomasochist fantasy where the English are often seen to be indulging and taking pleasure in pain for ‘the greater good’,” she explains. “We saw this with Brexit; when I’ve interviewed voters in the past they have told me things like ‘it will hurt but it will be worth it in the long run’.”</span></p>
<p><span>Baker theorises that this inclination towards suffering originates from nostalgia for post-war austerity. “We have not lived through a struggle like the WWII generation – which is so often harked back too in politics and more widely in British culture – that I wonder if people want their own version in order to feed their feelings of heroism and grandiosity,” she says. This much was clear during the coronavirus pandemic, with people eagerly invoking “Blitz spirit” and “keeping calm and carrying on” at the first opportunity. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“There is a pleasure in suffering... [there’s] a sadomasochist fantasy where the English are often seen to be indulging and taking pleasure in pain for ‘the greater good’” – Dr Tabitha Baker</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Historically, our society – like many others – has been hierarchical. Notably, the feudal system was introduced following the Norman conquest in 1066, as William I needed a way of quickly consolidating his control over the people. He created an effective top-down system, where he would give swathes of land to the nobility in exchange for their unwavering loyalty to the crown. Peasants, meanwhile, were expected to work the land and defer to their ‘superiors’ in exchange for ‘protection’ – even though they made up over 90 per cent of the population. </span><span>Though the feudal system was officially abolished in the 17th century, society was so stratified by deeply entrenched class disparity that it essentially made no difference. We’ve absorbed the lie that the upper classes </span><em><span>deserve</span></em><span> to be above us by virtue, that they </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> somehow different, that it really does mean something to have “blue blood” or to be “well-bred”. This culture of deference lives on, even now, as we can see clearly </span><span>in the spectacle of grief that’s currently unfolding.</span></p>
<p><span>In many TV interviews with people standing in the queue to view the Queen lying in state, large groups of mourners explained that they’d come down simply because they felt they <em>had</em> to do something to mark the occasion. Elsewhere in the country, people saw meteorological omens: rainbows and <a href="/life-culture/article/56922/1/the-internets-most-moving-tributes-to-her-majesty-the-queen-shrek">clouds shaped like the late monarch</a>. Analysts and commentators pored over the coverage, trying to unravel and explain the whole thing. But the meaning everyone has been searching for in the wake of the monarch’s death simply does not exist – people are grasping at something which isn’t really there. The marmalade sandwiches and the heaps of flowers all serve to obfuscate the truth: that underneath all the pageantry, monarchy is entirely meaningless. </span>But maybe at this point it’s easier and more comforting to believe that those with more social power than you really <em>do</em> deserve it. Arguably the reality – that the royal family are just <em>people</em>, no better or worse than the rest of us – is a harder pill to swallow.</p>
<p><span>Dr <a href="https://www.shu.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/staff-profiles/antony-taylor">Tony Taylor</a>, Professor of Modern British History at Sheffield Hallam University, explains that the intensity of feeling in many mourners makes sense given how long the Queen was on the throne. “</span><span>Elizabeth II had reigned for so long that [...] people can map their own life experiences onto key moments in her reign – in other words, they’re seeing their lives reflected through hers,” he explains. “Less about deference, I think, and more about the emotional connection people feel they have with a long-established institution. In that sense, Elizabeth has always been a symbol of constancy.” Grief is complex and personal, granted: it doesn’t make sense by design. But as important as it is to not invalidate anyone’s feelings, it’s equally important to acknowledge that this is exactly how the royal family hold on to power. As Alan Bennett says in <em>The History Boys: </em>“And all this mourning has veiled the truth. It’s not so much lest we forget, as lest we remember [...] there’s no better way of forgetting something than by commemorating it”. Bennett is talking about the world wars here, but his point still stands: pomp and spectacle often serve to obscure rather than illuminate.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“Elizabeth II had reigned for so long that [...] people can map their own life experiences onto key moments in her reign – in other words they’re seeing their lives reflected through hers” – Dr Tony Taylor</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Rory Scothorne wrote in the </span><a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2022/09/silence-reigns"><em><span>New Statesman</span></em></a><span> last week that the English are </span><span>“a People... that quite simply does not know how to speak for itself, and which sees almost every attempt to do so as dangerous and sinister.” </span><span>Time and time again, English people defer to the ruling power – be it Prime Minister or monarch – instead of stopping to consider that they might have more in common with their fellow plebeians and that it might be more worthwhile to ally with them instead.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Dr Baker, this attitude is inextricably bound up in our national identity. “All subscribe to a narrative [which] informs psychologically powerful experiences of nationhood, and can involve processes of blind followership and attachment,” she says. “But we should seek to be able to identify and understand nationalist myths as narratives which oversimplify, dramatise and most importantly, selectively narrate the nation’s past. We must think critically about what is remembered and forgotten, by whom and for what end.”</span></p>
<p><span>“We need to move towards a more constructive, progressive patriotism, rather than the uncritical patriotism we see dominate political culture, which often involves an unwillingness to accept or give criticism to a nation and in this case, its monarch,” she continues. “There is nothing wrong with loyalty, but we must allow ourselves to be critically loyal. This allows one to question and criticise, and enables them to positively improve the country for the better.”</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, we </span><em><span>do</span></em><span> have a history of rebellion and revolt: there was the 1381</span><span> </span><span>Peasants’ Revolt</span><span>; the aforementioned Diggers and Levellers; the successful suffrage movement in the early 20th century.</span><span> But it seems to take a seismic effort to get the English to see and </span><em><span>remember</span></em><span> the power in collective action – a stark contrast to the French, who will happily set a car alight as soon as they get a whiff of injustice. </span><span>Where individuals are brave enough to refuse to bow down in the current situation – like the man <a href="/life-culture/article/56934/1/police-cracking-down-on-anti-monarchy-protests-arrest">who called</a> Andrew “a sick old man” or the woman <a href="/life-culture/article/56934/1/police-cracking-down-on-anti-monarchy-protests-arrest">who held</a> a sign reading “Fuck imperialism, abolish the monarchy” –</span><span> the majority do nothing.</span></p>
<p><span>“</span><span>There’s also a sense of a moment in history passing, and people want to place themselves in that historical context,” Dr Taylor says, speaking of the crowds gathering in London to file past the royal coffin. Herein lies the problem – </span><span>people see history as something that just passively </span><em><span>happens</span></em><span>, something that is done </span><em><span>to</span></em><span> them. Do those swarming around Westminster Hall to gaze at the coffin not see themselves as agents of change, in control of their own destiny? Do they not realise that they’re in the very room where monarchy effectively ended 373 years ago, as the people seized power back from a corrupt king? Perhaps not. And so we do nothing, idly wondering if there will ever come a day when nobody’s head is on our coins, without grasping that the answer to that question lies with us – the people.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>A young man </span><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMNo6jxdN/"><span>leans into the camera</span></a><span>, “you want clear skin like this?”, he asks the viewer, “Imma tell you the number one thing you gotta do…” His secret isn’t a new product, painful treatment or expensive face tool. In fact, it costs nothing at all. The user, </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itsbhart"><span>@itsbhart,</span></a><span> is one of the hundreds of people on TikTok who believe in the powers of manifestation and <a href="/beauty/tag/meditation">meditation</a> to achieve clearer skin.</span></p>
<p><span>Under the hashtag </span><a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMNo6HMu6/"><span>#manifestingclearskin</span></a><span> (which has over 6.9 million views) there is a whole array of videos explaining how you can change your skin using just the power of your mind. Some recommend </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@iammorgselizabeth/video/7111879271185976577?_t=8VhYlWpS7r4amp;_r=1"><span>repeating affirmations</span></a><span> – “I have beautiful glowing skin” – while others suggest </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@valeriafune/video/7124713832299302190?_r=1amp;_t=8VhYyQSaUbtamp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;item_id=7124713832299302190"><span>visualising yourself</span></a><span> with your dream skin. Manifesting itself has questionable scientific credentials, but often what these users are tapping into – especially the ones who advocate <a href="https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/">meditation</a> or <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/breathwork">breathwork</a></span><span> – is psychodermatology. </span></p>
<p><a href="/beauty/article/43712/1/does-your-skin-need-therapy-pysche-psycodermatology"><span>Psychodermatology</span></a><span> is an emerging field of study that treats the skin using psychological techniques to address the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4082169/">brain-skin connection</a>.</span><span> It recognises techniques such as meditation, mindfulness and therapy for soothing the skin from the inside out. “Most people do not realise the impact of psychological health on the skin,” says </span><a href="http://www.thepsychodermatologist.com/"><span>Dr Alia Ahmed</span></a><span>, a consultant dermatologist who specialises in psychodermatology. “Psychodermatology empowers patients to recognise and manage this at the same time as treating their skin condition.” </span></p>
<p><span>Dr Ahmed sees patients for skin conditions such as <a href="/beauty/article/43241/1/why-we-need-to-talk-about-eczema">eczema</a> and <a href="/beauty/tag/acne">acne</a>, those suffering from the psychological impacts of lowered self-esteem and anxiety caused by skin conditions, as well as patients with skin problems rooted in psychiatric or psychological distress, such as skin picking. The mind-skin connection can most evidently be seen through reactions like blushing, when mental embarrassment shows up physically on your skin. But feelings of emotional distress can also lead to the release of <a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-is-cortisol">cortisol</a>, the stress hormone, which can <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2133.2010.09984.x">wreak havoc</a> on the skin.</span></p><p><span>“Cortisol is known to affect the immune system (making the skin less able to defend itself), drive allergic responses, delay healing and disrupt the skin’s natural barrier,” Dr Ahmed explains. Temporary symptoms like itching or flushing can be brought on by cortisol, but in the longer term the body can also enter a “permanent ‘stress-response’ state, which can aggravate existing skin problems through a poor natural immune response and ongoing inflammation.”</span></p>
<p><span>Psychodermatology takes a holistic approach to skincare, by looking to the root of problematic skin rather than just trying to improve the symptoms. Practising <a href="/beauty/tag/mindfulness">mindfulness</a>, meditation, <a href="/beauty/article/55912/1/breathwork-for-beginners-a-guide-to-the-calming-practice">breathwork</a> or even seeking therapy can help to relieve stress and anxiety, lower cortisol levels and potentially help your skin. A recent </span><a href="https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/242042603/KonczEtal2021HPRMeditationInterventions.pdf"><span>study</span></a><span> by the University of Edinburgh found that all schools of meditative practice, from mindfulness to transcendental and zen meditation, helped lower cortisol levels, particularly for those going through a stressful time in their lives. It’s no wonder that a </span><a href="https://www.skinsupport.org.uk/content/psychodermatology"><span>2014 study</span></a><span> into psychodermatology found that amongst patients who completed psychodermatology therapies, 94 per cent reported reduced stress, 92 per cent reported increased confidence, and 90 per cent reported that they understood their skin condition better.</span></p>
<p><span>The great thing about techniques like meditation and breathwork is that it offers a solution that doesn’t require you to buy anything. They are completely free and accessible to everyone. However, that hasn’t stopped the industry from trying to get in on the mind-skin connection action. An increasing number of skincare brands have begun incorporating stress relief into their lines. Murad skincare </span><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dr-murads-inspirations/id899453028"><span>has an app</span></a><span> that sends out daily affirmations from Dr Murad himself (“allow the unique you to blossom”), whilst Alicia Keys’ skincare line, Keys Soulcare, offers </span><a href="https://www.keyssoulcare.com/en_GB/body/how-to-master-self-care-from-the-outside-in.html"><span>a selection of rituals</span></a><span> that incorporate certain combinations of products (including candles and face rollers) with setting intentions, affirmations and “shifting consciousness” to help you “master self-care”. </span></p>
<p><span>Stress relief and ritual are important elements of <a href="https://www.cosmossbykatemoss.com/shop/rituals/">Cosmoss</a>, Kate Moss’ new <a href="/beauty/article/56876/1/kate-mosss-beauty-brand-is-different-from-what-you-might-expect">wellness and skincare line</a> too. Separated into “dawn, day and dusk”, a thrice-daily skincare routine (with accompanying day and nighttime teas) is suggested to soothe the body and soul, providing a sense of inner peace and bringing emotional balance. “When Kate started looking at being more in harmony with her health, she found rituals were really helpful,” says <a href="https://goop.com/gb-en/place/place-385778-health-and-beauty/victoria-young/">Victoria Young</a>, Kate Moss’ personal homoeopath who consults on the brand. “It removes the emotion from the decision; you decide it is part of your morning and you build it into your day.”</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>Considering skincare from a more holistic standpoint and practising self-care is never a bad thing, but psychodermatology is about utilising practices like therapy and meditation, not just lighting a candle or drinking tea. While brands like Cosmoss, Murad and Keys Soulcare are a step in the right direction, encouraging consumers to consider mind-skin connection and a more 360 approach to skincare, they’re still floating the idea that achieving inner calm requires a credit card. </span></p>
<p><span>One brand doing things a little differently is </span><a href="https://wildsource.co.uk/"><span>Wild Source</span></a><span>, a range of skincare that also offers free guided meditations on its website, for customers and non-customers alike. The brand began in 2017, when founder Kate Roath found herself burnt out with a bad eczema flare-up and made an oath to herself to commit to doing ten minutes of meditation a day. “I’d cleanse my face, put my oil on and meditate,” she says. The new habit immediately made her feel calmer and more focused, but to her surprise there was another benefit too: her skin cleared up and her eczema calmed down.</span></p>
<p><span>“Stress affects every organ in our body but the skin is the one that we see. So we get stressed, have a flare-up, get even more stressed about the flare-up and fall into a vicious cycle,” says Roath. She decided to incorporate meditation into her company and make it tangible for customers by “stacking it onto their existing skincare routine and almost packaging it as another skincare product.” The idea is to educate people on psychodermatology and the mental tools they have at their fingertips, to use alongside the brand's purchasable products.</span></p>
<p><span>In an age of ten-step skincare routines, skincare fridges and a seemingly endless supply of new celebrity skincare lines, the science behind psychodermatology offers something rare in the beauty industry – skincare that doesn’t require you to buy anything. While brands are increasingly incorporating mind-skin connection into their product offerings, the acts of meditation and mindfulness to reduce stress in the mind and body can be done for free – doing both your bank balance and the planet a favour. </span></p>]]>

<p><span>"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose," writes Gertrude Stein in the 1913 poem </span><em><span>Sacred Emily</span></em><span>. It’s a famous line well agitated by society and culture, that’s lost some intended meaning – it’s Stein’s truer ethos that has inspired </span><a href="/fashion/article/55508/1/the-infinite-of-joy-emma-chopova-laura-lowena-kilts-clothing-aw22-collection"><span>Chopova Lowena</span></a><span>’s <a href="/ss23">SS23</a> collection and debut <a href="/lfw">LFW</a> show. </span></p>
<p><span>"Today, we think of the quote as meaning that we should let things be just what they are, but I think it’s more about the strength of an image," says Emma Chopova, alongside Laura Lowena-Irons. The rose is imbued with personal weight, cultural meaning, and an immediate multisensory experience. “The rose was a defining image of the Romantic period, that through literature gave people a visual and a scent – that’s so powerful,” Chopova continues. “We interpreted that with a collection that displaces images, styles, and silhouettes – in the tailoring and formal dresses that take you somewhere, skirts with hoodies, subtle juxtaposition and surprising textures.”</span></p><p><span>To just ‘let things be’ wouldn’t really be the Chopova Lowena way. Since graduating CSM with their rapturously received 2017 MA collection, they’ve built their eponymous label on an allegiance to Bulgarian ancestry and folkloric craftsmanship, staying true to sustainable sensibilities with upcycled and carefully sourced deadstock fabrics, in collaboration with Bulgarian artisans and craftswomen. This is all melded together with a total punk insouciance. It’s won them an </span><a href="/tag/lvmh"><span>LVMH</span></a><span> prize nomination, sold-out runs on Matches, and fans from </span><a href="/tag/dua-lipa"><span>Dua Lipa</span></a><span> to </span><a href="/tag/harry-styles"><span>Harry Styles</span></a><span>. The dramatic pleated skirt with punky </span><span>carabiner clips </span><span>in a kaleidoscope of colours and patterns is a much-photographed signature style. </span></p>
<p><span>The Chopova Lowena aesthetic is founded in a playful mish-mash of traditions and sport, with previous collections fusing mediaeval dressing with ice hockey. SS23 finds us amid the pageantry of the Bulgarian village of Kazanlak’s traditional Rose Festival, and at the climax of a lacrosse match. “It was important for us to go back to our roots as we get to the runway,” says Chopova. “The festival of the rose is all about its beauty and abundance. They nominate a rose queen, and have a parade all through the town in these pink, tacky prom-like dresses.”</span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Morgane Maurice</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>“We have researched the traditions and costumes through the years,” says Lowena-Irons. “We’ve incorporated more textiles – even more so than we usually do! – into newer categories, like denim and tailoring. </span><span>I’m just so excited for people to see our whole world in one place all at once, its movement.”</span></p>
<p><span>Personal narratives thread through the collection – the denim is inspired by Chopova’s parents’ experience under communism, buying jeans on “the black market in the back alleys of Sofia”. </span><span>The show is dedicated to Chopova’s two grandmothers, Emilia Minkova Ioveva and Antoaneta Kostova Shopova, who passed away recently.</span></p>
<p><span>“The sport inspires the collection’s mood: schoolgirl intensity, the primal competitiveness on a pitch,” adds Lowena-Irons. </span></p>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330206.jpg" alt="Chopova Lowena SS23 womenswear" />		<figcaption>
			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Morgane Maurice</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>We speak two days before the show in their Deptford, South London studio, a heaving ventricle of clothing rails. There’s the wind-whipping kilts, rose and swan clip buckles, arcade machine charms, and clinking carabiner clips, pastoral and dense tapestry fabrics, tinsel-knitted jerseys and taffeta prom dresses spray painted with doodles, rose-flocked and chain-braided denim, </span><span>a fil coupé-patterned skirt that spells “CL” in Bulgarian. Sumptuous pinks and lacey bridal whites sit alongside Hot Topic-fuschias, reds, blacks. </span><span>A table of accessories features lines of reflective sunglasses that recall lacrosse goggles, tinsel-pocked shoes, and </span><span>macramé</span><span> bags knotted with healing crystals. </span></p>
<p><span>There is a frenetic interplay of heritage and modernity, a sly take on uniforms from the prom dress to the sportswear, punctuated with the teen angst and rebellion that they knew well themselves growing up in the 00s as self-described “outsiders”. “That mood clash with the highs of a lacrosse game and the tacky pageantry is really exciting,” Lowena-Irons says.</span></p>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330201.jpg" alt="Chopova Lowena SS23 womenswear" />		<figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>The duo fizz with trepidation, but there’s also a sense of calm and assuredness – that’s all despite the hasty reschedule, following the British queen’s death. We sit in the studio to chat, a cakestand of wonky, colourful cakes on the table and Chopova’s grey and black spotted pug Jello nestled in the pleats of Lowena-Irons’ skirt.</span></p>
<p><span>“We really are lucky to have the team around us that we do,” says Lowena-Irons. They credit casting director Sarah Small for their diverse, street cast line-up and known models, including Lowena-Irons’ brother Harvey, designer and CSM mentor Louise Gray, artist Maggie Dunlap, and jeweller and SS21 collaborator Georgina Kemball. “It was important for us to have people walking in our show who have been there for us from the beginning, who helped us shape our identity. They all bring their own character and movement.” </span></p>
<p><span>As the label grows – from childrenswear to more genderless designs – they’re mindful of staying innovative as well as sustainable. “It’s difficult to scale with deadstock fabric, truthfully,” says Chopova. </span></p>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330191.jpg" alt="Chopova Lowena SS23 womenswear" />		<figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>“And denim is notoriously polluting, indigo dyeing is the worst,” adds Lowena-Irons. The collection incorporates raw and vintage denim, and deadstock fabrics sourced by Chopova’s mother – now a full-time employee – with connections in Bulgaria’s markets and auction sites. Rare fabrics sourced some time ago will make their debut.</span></p>
<p><span>So too, is Chopova Lowena committed to a customer that transcends gender, size, and age. "It has been so cool to see all kinds of people buy our clothes and incorporate them into their own sense of style. It is so personal to us, so to see how people connect with it is touching,” says Lowena-Irons. “We design for personalities more than anything.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The only thing that differs when designing for different genders and bodies is fit,” says Chopova. “We can be constrained by retailers’ categories, but that’s even changed so much since we started.”</span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Morgane Maurice</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>The commitment to togetherness and community shines, even more so on the night, taking place in west London’s Porchester Hall – ”it’s dark, David Lynch vibes, loads of fun,” says Lowena-Irons. The brand’s kilts and aprons pock the crowd. It is an empyrean, ecstatic debut. The models stomp the maze-like runway with the intensity of athletes ready to intimidate opponents, to a soundtrack of Bulgarian choirs, death metal, and lacrosse game dialogue and chants. The delectable details of every brooch, button, and tinsel catching the light, the carabiner clips clink a joyous jingle. </span></p>
<p><span>“I just really want to do it for</span><em><span> us</span></em><span> – I want us to have our fashion show dream,” says Chopova. "We're so happy with the narrative we’re building."</span></p>
<p><span>“We have the opportunity to have complete control, and you don't always get that,” says Lowena-Irons. “This is a moment we’ve gotten to curate and craft the experience to exactly what we want.”</span></p>
<p><span>And where next – dog wear? “If Jello can hold still!”</span></p>]]>

<p><span>As </span><a href="/user/tomrasmussen"><span>Tom Rasmussen</span></a><span> wrote in their recent ode to </span><a href="/tag/lfw"><span>London Fashion Week</span></a><span>’s wild creativity and unmatched vibes, good fashion should have the power to move you, and I don’t think I’ve ever been quite so moved by a show than </span><a href="/fashion/article/44869/1/karoline-vitto-gomes-fashion-designer-royal-college-art-body-image-positivity"><span>Karoline Vitto</span></a><span>’s debut at </span><a href="/tag/fashion-east"><span>Fashion East</span></a><span> yesterday. The tears started coming when I sat down to write her show notes a little under a week ago, and ended backstage with a congratulatory hug with the Brazilian designer. Don’t think this was a chic, elegant teardrop rolling down my cheek in a dignified manner – this was face screwed up, “I think I’m going to have to go outside” style sobs. A fashion person? Showing feelings? Embarrassing!</span></p>
<p><span>In case you’re not familiar with her work, a bit of background. Vitto grew up in Brazil, and, given the country’s narrow ideals of beauty, she was hyperconscious of her body from a young age. Things shifted when she moved to London to study fashion at Central Saint Martins. The designer began </span><span>to strip off and take mirror selfies in which she contorted herself so as to create folds and creases across her body. This became an integral part of her design practice: using moulded metal frames, Vitto started to spotlight the squishy bits we’ve been conditioned to hate as things of beauty, and turned them into a series of sensual vignettes. </span></p><p><span>Since graduating from the </span><a href="/tag/royal-college-of-art"><span>Royal College of Art</span></a><span>, Vitto has been hammering away at her label, largely custom-making slinky dresses, pencil skirts, and barely-there cut-out tops bearing these unique steel inserts. SS23 marked her first, fully-realised collection under </span><a href="/fashion/article/55383/1/lulu-kennedy-fashion-east-video-designers-london-kim-jones-jonathan-anderson"><span>Lulu Kennedy</span></a><span> and Raphaelle Moore’s watchful eye, however, and, beyond being completely stunning, her debut show under the Fashion East umbrella felt like a truly seismic moment for the fashion industry, as she sent her clothes out on a cast entirely made up of ‘curve’ models. </span></p>
<p><span>Though there’s still loads of work to be done, across the course of the last few years, the industry has made a massive amount of progress in terms of racial and gender diversity, but when it comes to size representation, fashion is reluctant to make changes. Seeing curve models on the runway is still a rarity, with those cast often feeling tokenistic and box-ticking as opposed to a genuine commitment to making change and catering to a massive community of fashion lovers with money to spend. Being a fat woman working in fashion is hard: not only do you have to sit through endless shows in which no one looks remotely like you, the excuses you must listen to from brands and designers that refuse to include models with bodies that go beyond sample size, or create clothes above a UK size 12 or 14 are truly exhausting. </span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Cris Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>Yet here is a young designer, with limited resources, who proved that, while it’s not without its difficulties, it’s really not as hard as fashion makes it seem. With casting by Maddie </span><span>Østlie, not a single member of the model cast was under a size ten, and ranged all the way up to a size 22. And while they looked powerful, and confident, and fierce – and all those hyperbolic terms used to describe fat women taking up their rightful space – in the collection’s skimpy-but-supportive bikinis, dramatic floor-sweeping gowns, and languid, loose-legged trousers, they also just looked completely fab and normal. Like they’d been there all along. </span></p>
<p><span>Often when I go to showroom appointments or collection re-sees, I ask if the brand has plans to expand its size range, or cast larger models in its shows. I usually feel like I’m regarded as having a vested interest in this area, that I’m demanding fashion caters to me. And while, yes, I’d love to slip into clothes by some of my fave designers, despite the fact they’ve deemed me an undesirable customer, I’m more concerned that a rising generation of women see themselves represented on the runway, and don’t fall into the trap of hating their bodies in the same way that Vitto and I once did. </span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Cris Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>The reality is that this conversation expands far beyond just the fat people working in fashion. When </span><a href="/fashion/article/54150/1/precious-lee-area-nyc-met-ball-crystal-look-curve-model-fashion-week"><span>Precious Lee</span></a><span> walks out at shows – like at </span><a href="/tag/versace"><span>Versace AW22</span></a><span>, for example – phones shoot up to the sounds of gasps and whoops. If </span><a href="/fashion/article/48059/1/paloma-elsesser-stole-the-fendi-fashion-show-aw20-milan"><span>Paloma Elsesser</span></a><span> features on a model line-up, you can guarantee you’re going to hear a bunch of attendees discussing how hot she looked while piling out of the venue. On day one of London Fashion Week SS23, there were some truly fab shows: like KNWLS, and Chopova Lowena’s insanely brilliant runway debut. But as people settled into hotel lobbies to bash out reviews, file reports, and catch up over coffee and wine, conversation kept coming back to Vitto and how blown away everyone was by what she did – and that, I think, says it all. As </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/jeanieus/?hl=en"><span>Jeanie-Annan Lewin</span></a><span> so succinctly put it: “Protect Karoline Vitto at all costs.”</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>“Sorry, this is the longest cigarette I’ve ever had,” says </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/carzana/?hl=en"><span>Paolo Carzana</span></a><span>, who has been smoking a cigarette for about 30 seconds. It’s 9am and he’s standing outside the entrance of his studio at <a href="/tag/alexander-mcqueen">Lee (</a></span><a href="/tag/alexander-mcqueen"><span>Alexander) McQueen</span></a><span>’s Sarabande Foundation. But with just three days to go until his next presentation at </span><a href="/tag/lfw"><span>London Fashion Week</span></a><span>, he’s beginning to lose purchase on his words – and his 4G connection. The screen glitches, his voice lags, the signal cuts out, he takes accidental screenshots, and stops to corral his team into various rooms. “Ugh, I haven’t been to sleep, which is why I’m a bit delirious. I’ve still got a casting to get through this morning and then a styling session this afternoon, so I’m feeling quite stressed, sorry.” </span></p>
<p><span>A storybook of Welsh mythologies, where faerie guides, changelings, and medicinal plants are an ambient part of the everyday, Carzana’s collections are the work of a pilgrim designer – of someone who approaches fashion not only as a site of radical transformation, but of quiet and profound healing. His name first attracted intrigue at </span><a href="/tag/university-of-westminster"><span>Westminster University</span></a><span>, where a brooding and organically-sourced showcase laid the foundations for an MA at </span><a href="/tag/central-saint-martins"><span>Central Saint Martins</span></a><span>, paid for by </span><a href="/tag/kering"><span>Kering</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/tag/lvmh"><span>LVMH</span></a><span>. Following his breakout collection last summer, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/sarahmower_/?hl=en"><span>Sarah Mower</span></a><span> described Carzana as “</span><span>a visionary” and “a wonder to the fashion world”, likening his outlier talent to </span><a href="/tag/alexander-mcqueen"><span>McQueen</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/tag/john-galliano"><span>John Galliano</span></a><span>. A couple of months later, he secured a place on the British Fashion Council’s prestigious NEWGEN incubator – and then, life as he knew it began to cave in on itself.</span></p><p><span>“How emotional do you want me to get here,” he stops mid-sentence. “Because there have been a lot of obstacles.” As Carzana leads me – or rather, his iPhone – through a pair of paddock gates, past a cobblestone courtyard, and into the intestines of the Sarabande, the past couple of years finally come into focus. “When I graduated from my MA it was just before the pandemic started, so I moved back to Cardiff for what ended up being a year and a half. And I hated it. There was no creative community to make me feel sane with what I was doing. So I created a collection, alone in lockdown, that was based on all these characters I had imagined were protecting me. Then, as soon as I moved back to London, I fell ill for six months. I started to get all types of different infections and had to go for constant scans. I think I had ten courses of antibiotics in two months,” he says. “I think it was rooted in stress.” </span></p>
<p><span>“Weirdly I’ve reached a very hopeful and happy space, and today’s collection feels like the ending of the beginning.” Carzana’s practice has always been an intensely personal one, running the proverbial film backward and reconstructing some of his most debilitating moments – like “being on the receiving end of an abuse of power”, which once gave way to exoskeletal suit jackets looming over the boyish models of his BA collection. “It was made to look like someone was puppeting my decisions and feelings,” he says, but all those imposing figures have now faded into what he calls “guardian angels”, free-floating behind this season’s cast in silhouettes of gossamer organza. On their feet, meanwhile, are shoes borrowed from McQueen. “The whole thing is dedicated to Lee, I want him to ground the models and give them strength because Sarabande very much saved my life. It enabled me to keep on fighting.”</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>The show’s title – </span><em><span>Imagine We Could Be The Ones To Change It All</span></em><span> – was taken from a mindless scribbling that Carzana had jotted down in his BA portfolio in 2018. “It actually got picked-up by Sarah and became the title of our </span><em><span>Vogue</span></em><span> interview, and then I think </span><em><span>i-D</span></em><span> used it as a cover line, so I’m guessing I’m reclaiming the phrase,” he says, with a laugh. “I didn’t fully understand it back then but I really feel it now. I guess it’s all-encompassing of how I want to behave.” Tracing an imagined 24-hour period, today’s collection travels through droopy and densely-layered outerwear in the kind of black so dark that it’s </span><em><span>meant</span></em><span> to invoke pain, before giving way to delicate ecru two pieces, pebble-hued tapestry coats, and stark white “open heart” shirts that look as though they might disintegrate at the touch. “I’ve been far more sensitive with the cutting because this time it’s all about strength and fragility,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span>Bamboo, organic cotton, and pineapple leather </span><span>is frayed, whorled, and nipped-in at the torso, while tactile creases branch out across slack-lined coats as if to trace the nervous system. “It all looks a bit crap but I promise in person it’s better,” he says. “This is the hardest I’ve ever worked, but it’s probably the worst presentation you’ve ever had in your life.” Even despite the critical acclaim, Carzana is the last to recognise just how unusual his talent really is. “What Paolo creates is sublime,” says </span><a href="/tag/nasir-mazhar"><span>Nasir Mazhar</span></a><span>, his former MA tutor, who has created a couple of Welsh bonnets for the show. “The cut of the garments, fabrics hand-dyed using natural ingredients and therapeutic oils which hold healing powers, completely handmade with the most sensual touch and imagination. He is an absolute visionary. He is the future of luxury fashion.” </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>Clothes, for Carzana, are dressings to bind a wound, with each and every detail harbouring some kind of symbolic resonance – and to a near obsessive degree. Obviously, that’s not the only way to make clothes – it was</span> <a href="/tag/phoebe-philo"><span>Phoebe Philo</span></a><span> who</span> <a href="http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG3306058/Moll-made-good.html"><span>said</span></a><span> “I wanted to make a pair of trousers that made my arse look good, rather than a pair that represented the Holocaust or something” – but he believes it’s endemic to good design. “Ultimately, if you’re creating something then of course it’s going to have meaning. Even if it's just the weight of the fabric and how that’s going to keep you warm. Sorry that’s not very poetic, but I think it’s true.” It goes without saying, then, that burrowed within Carzana’s SS23 collection, is a pre-determined system of semiotics: there’s a “tender” prologue</span><strong>, </strong><span>a Pasolini-devoted chapter, a </span>“<span>forza” (Italian for strength) chapter, a ”brueder” (Welsh for fragility) chapter, and a “guardian” epilogue.</span></p>
<p><span>The comparisons that have been drawn between Carzana and the likes of McQueen and Galliano aren’t just speculative: all of them are working class designers who made it their business to prove that “finance isn’t the be all and end all.” Outside of the studio, Carzana has worked with an </span><a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/partnerships/outreach/applications-for-ual-insights"><span>outreach programme</span></a><span> committed to broadening access to the arts among low-income teenagers. “It’s about encouraging them not to give up, but then I’d go back to CSM and other students had paid-for pattern-makers and seamstresses. It felt like such a lie, so when I did my MA I made it a point to make every single garment myself. I didn’t even use the school technicians because I wanted to show that you can do it yourself.” Carzana knows the value in this kind of mentorship better than most, describing art as his “saviour” in school. “I was bullied, like, every single day and so at lunchtimes I’d go to art class and my teachers would show me books on McQueen, Philipp Treacy, and the Antwerp Six.” </span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>“I never would have found out about those people till much, much later in life,” he adds. “I believe in hard work and not giving up and kindness, but also that people – or things – are definitely looking out for you, whatever that means... I’ve experienced it.” As Carzana storms back across the gardens of the Sarabande, garment bags lugged over his shoulder, face fading into a cluster of pixels, I ask where all this </span><span>yearning for protection and vulnerability </span><span>might have actually come from. </span><span>“That’s a big question and an answer for another time,” he says. “But I think family and class give someone a certain sensitivity. I’m happy to wait to tell that story, though. I’m not ready to give everything up to everyone just yet.” </span></p>]]>

In the belly of The Mills Fabrica, a repurposed Victorian warehouse in North London, Fashion East unleashed a swarm of young designers onto fashion’s glitterati. It was bittersweet, debuting the work of two new talents – Standing Ground and Karoline Vitto – while bidding farewell to Jawara Alleyne, who delivered his fourth and final collection under Lulu Kennedy and Raphaelle Moore’s watchful eye. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Christina Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

It’s fitting then, that the Cayman-born designer’s offering should go by the title of The New World, drawing on the colonial myth of discovery – finding untapped soil in far-off lands and eradicating the histories of its inhabitants. “How do you build an identity when fragments of yourself have been told to you in ways that you have to decipher?,” he asked in the accompanying show notes. The show loosely follows the imagined story of a yacht crashing into a pirate ship, with Alleyne fashioning pirates, captains, tourists, and onlookers from recycled and deadstock fabrics. Alongside his signature cut and pinned t-shirts, came breezy asymmetrical skirts, draped tops held together by knots, and denim skirts wrapped around the hips like a beach towel. Languid dresses are fastened with staples, shirts are tied-together or otherwise safety-pinned, while repurposed suit jackets become vests, and a finale gown is constructed entirely from dress jersey strips and flailing strings.			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Christina Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

Choosing to show presentation-style, with models leaning against concrete pillars, Standing Ground debuted its first Fashion East collection, dubbed #218;r – which is an old Irish word for soil. In his own show notes, designer Michael Stewart speaks about spiritual and ancestral artefacts, and the clothes embodied this ancient, neolithic feel: evening gowns in lime, scarlet, canary, and earthen brown jerseys in heavy drapes and slashed layers. Singular hip pads and vine-like roping coiled around the torso, transforming models into regal statues plucked from some kind of mediaeval fantasy saga. Stewart says that it’s in these lines, seams, and bands, that “one reflects on ancient migration routes” – looking at the body as if it were an Irish landscape of storybooks and mythologies. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Christina Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

<p><span>With tales of obsession, late-night antics and altered states, </span><em><span>Incantations</span></em><span> is the second release by </span><a href="/tag/felix-lee"><span>Felix Lee</span></a><span>. The south London artist </span><span>has spent the last decade making his mark on the city’s eclectic underground scene with his anarchic club night Endless, an incubator for new sounds and styles, along with curating its monthly NTS show. </span></p>
<p><span>Following on from his 2019 debut<em> Inna Daze</em>, </span><em><span>Incantations</span></em><span> is an intimate retelling of early hours spent wandering across the city. Featuring friends and collaborators such as <a href="/tag/drain-gang">Bladee</a>, Cold, Oxhy and <a href="/music/article/56278/1/whitearmor-drain-gang-music-for-weddings-interview">Whitearmor</a>, there’s a liminal quality to Lee’s observations, where blurry soundscapes rub shoulders with emotionally charged vocals and distorted string arrangements that feels neither here nor there. </span></p><p><span>For his exclusive Dazed mix, Lee has created an OST to a film that doesn’t exist, made up of field recordings taken from around his house in Brixton, synth accompaniments, </span><span>and samples flipped from his archives.</span></p><div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-soundcloudtrack" data-id="1345214437"><iframe class="soundcloud-embed" frameborder="0" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com/tracks/1345214437amp;amp;show_artwork=true" width="100%"></iframe></div><p><strong>You’ve just released <em>Incantations</em>, how do you feel about it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee: </strong><span>I feel blessed. It’s been one of those projects that was supposed to take a couple months, then spiraled into a year plus of moving around, recording, re-writing. I had a lot of side work last year doing score stuff, which took over for a bit.</span></p>
<p><strong>What’s the meaning behind the album’s name?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee:</strong><span> It comes from a loose narrative behind the songs, and as a voice-led project, how lyrics can be a type of ‘incantation’ or spell.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some of the inspirations behind the record?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee:</strong><span> I wanted to lock down a very specific feeling, similar to my first LP, but expand on it further. It’s like a white noise undertone of dread, interrupted by moments of joy and detachment. I’m really into writing dark ballads and thinking of everything I make as a soundtrack to these kinda states.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are some of your earliest memories of music? Have they influenced your sound at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee:</strong><span> My dad would bang out a lot of music that still inspires me to this day. He put me on to a lot of post punk, like Suicide, The Fall etc. Some of my earliest memories are of these records coming out of our kitchen stereo. Also, although it sounds cliche, growing up in south gave me an affinity to blown-out sound-systems and bass culture that informs most of the music I make equally. </span><span> </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><strong>What are you listening to at the moment?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee: </strong><span>All types of things. It could be Psychic TV or Skeng depending what vibe I’m on – and a lot of new or unreleased stuff from my friends: The Fertile Crescent, Xterea, Kamixlo, Bela, Palmistry... off the dome, the list goes on.</span></p>
<p><strong>Any fun projects or shows lined up?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee: </strong><span>I’ve been enjoying performing live lately. I feel like I finally figured out how to get my point across. Got a couple videos soon, and am starting the next full–length project too, along with some collaborations. </span></p>
<p><strong>Tell us about your Dazed mix.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee: </strong><span>I wanted to do something a bit different. Instead of a making DJ mix to skip through, and eventually get lost in the algorithm, I went for a walk around my area with a recorder, then spent a day in the studio improvising with synths, chopping, and mangling all the sounds until it sounded like something.</span></p>
<p><strong>How were you feeling when making it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Felix Lee: </strong><span>Tunnel vision.</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Funny Pages is a gritty comedy about failed comic-book artists</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Owen Kline tells Nick Chen about his offbeat coming-of-age film, which was co-produced by the Safdie brothers</h3>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">What if your hand views the world differently from your eyes? When comic-book artists draw with just a pen and paper, it’s intrinsically an extension of themselves, the shapes and ideas materialising from their imagination and subconscious. At least, that’s what I tell Owen Kline, an actor-turned-cartoonist-turned-filmmaker, when he asks why I don’t draw: I would rather not know how I deep-down perceive my surroundings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a psychological test,” says Kline, 30, speaking over Zoom from his home in New York. “If I asked you to draw a family, or trees, or what God looks like – I could psychoanalyse you. That’s what’s fascinating about crude, homemade comics. All the stuff you might apply to auteurism, you can apply to comics tenfold because it’s all coming from one hand.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The last, and possibly only, time you saw Kline was probably in<span> </span><a href="/film-tv/article/47108/1/noah-baumbach-marriage-story-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-interview" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/47108/1/noah-baumbach-marriage-story-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-interviewamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663432406472000amp;usg=AOvVaw3ge1qgQNVqImzKKIhn1KB4">Noah Baumbach</a>’s 2005 divorce-drama<span> </span><em>The Squid and the Whale</em>, in which Kline played the angsty, beer-drinking 12-year-old Frank. Nearly two decades later, Kline has returned to movies behind the camera as the writer and director of<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em>, a gritty, grotty comedy about failed comic-book artists. Not savvy networkers who draw superheroes, but stubborn misanthropes whose panels are scrappy, have smudged lines, and are redolent of Harvey Pekar and Robert Crumb. With<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>emulating the offbeat visuals of the art it celebrates, it’s possible it wasn’t written on Final Draft, but actually first sketched by hand.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="eeoLrW6xMDs"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eeoLrW6xMDs" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p style="font-weight: 400;">“The movie was adapted from a short comic I did called<span> </span><em>Robert in the Boiler Room</em>,” Kline clarifies. “It was the first inkling of the movie’s world: the strange, mismatched communication and cultural orbits.” He provides a lengthy dissection of<span> </span><em>Save the Cat</em>, Hitchcock, and De Palma, all screenwriting methods he deliberately avoided. “I’m starting with character and stretching that out. What is the absolute ceiling of emotional vulnerability, insanity, and weakness?”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>is also a coming-of-age story starring Daniel Zolghadri (creepy Riley from<span> </span><em>Eighth Grade</em>, but a total charmer here) as Robert, an 18-year-old comics enthusiast whose middle-class background contradicts the outsider voices he worships. In the opening scene, Robert’s art teacher, Mr Katano (Stephen Adly Guirgis), strips nude and forces the boy to draw every wrinkly contour of his body, including down there. When the teacher drives after Robert, attempting to apologise, his car crashes and it’s fatal. In any other movie, it’d be the catalyst for a drama about grief and trauma; in<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em>, it’s a dark, laugh-out-loud punchline, inspiring Robert to chase after a new morally corrupt artist to mentor him.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kline, whose parents are Phoebe Cates and Kevin Kline, has always been an eager cartoonist. (<a href="https://twitter.com/NickPinkerton/status/1381982764384321539" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/NickPinkerton/status/1381982764384321539amp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663432406472000amp;usg=AOvVaw1ppaJULkkgeuM4cs8o7JUA">A recent example can be viewed here.</a>) As a 10-year-old, he taught himself to draw via Bruce Blitz videos (the American version of<span> </span><em>Art Attack</em>), envisioning a career in newspaper comics. “It was character, more so than comics as a medium, that I was interested in,” Kline recalls. “But the incredible thing about comics, especially ones made outside of any system, is that they’re an uninhibited art form. You’re going to tap way quicker into your natural preoccupations.”</p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em>, Robert rebels against his overprotective, loving parents by seeking a lifestyle that will fuel his creativity. He moves into an unhygienic, underground flat in which pet fish can’t survive the atmosphere, and shares a cramped bedroom with a man who doesn’t lock the door when masturbating to comics. Elsewhere, Robert encounters oddballs around New Jersey; when he pisses at a urinal next to a stranger splashing water on his armpits, what’s more surprising is that someone in this film actually washes themselves.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In regards to a film about mentors, it’s noticeable whose names are on the credits:<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>was co-produced by Benny and Josh Safdie, the siblings behind<span> </span><em><a href="/film-tv/article/37929/1/exclusive-notes-safdie-brothers-good-time-robert-pattinson" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/37929/1/exclusive-notes-safdie-brothers-good-time-robert-pattinsonamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663432406472000amp;usg=AOvVaw3kzpbJxxE7LZUWywRrro-f">Good Time</a></em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em><a href="/film-tv/article/47321/1/safdie-brothers-josh-bennie-uncut-gems-interview" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/47321/1/safdie-brothers-josh-bennie-uncut-gems-interviewamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663432406472000amp;usg=AOvVaw1dpiyifhU_O1p8G-Lm6YbD">Uncut Gems</a></em>, and Ronald Bronstein, the third, albeit non-biological, Safdie. Along with having Sean Price Williams (<em>Heaven Knows What</em>,<span> </span><em>Good Time</em>) as cinematographer,<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>includes cameos from Buddy Duress (the prison escapee from<span> </span><em>Good Time</em>) and Mitchell Wenig (one of the<span> </span><em>Uncut Gems</em><span> </span>twins). You’re almost waiting for Adam Sandler and Julia Fox to saunter past in the background. “The first stuff we shot was in that basement,” Kline notes. “The Safdies were upstairs at their monitor. They ran downstairs, saying, ‘This is a comedy!’”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kline was 15 when he befriended the Safdies, who, at the time, were at Boston University, uploading shorts to their personal website<span> </span><a href="https://www.redbucketfilms.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.redbucketfilms.com/amp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663432406472000amp;usg=AOvVaw1_Q5G9I29oP75UZgyTHTOs">Red Bucket Films</a>. “I worked on a couple of those,” Kline says. “I was playing in bands in the DIY music scene, I was putting out crank call tapes. I had these weird preoccupations but the Safdies treated me seriously as an artist. I was 18 and they let me (and a friend) animate the trailer for<span> </span><em>Daddy Longlegs</em>. That’s a lot of faith to put in a young person.”</p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He continues, “I worked on<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>through all sorts of jobs, on weekends, for over six years, in terms of writing, and trying to get anyone to give it money. Josh (Safdie) was the only person who took this project seriously, and helped me when I was struggling to find funds, after spending two years trying to get anyone to even read the fucking thing. That’s the hardest part, getting someone to read it, period!”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kline, of course, could have done things differently. He co-starred in<span> </span><em>The Squid and the Whale</em><span> </span>because it was during the summer holidays and Baumbach was a family friend. “I didn’t really want to act after that,” he says. “I was lucky to know the director, and he wanted me.” However, he was asked to read for the role in<span> </span><em>Superbad</em><span> </span>that later went to Michael Cera. “I was flattered and almost brought myself to do it. The kids were going to be a little younger. I was a 15-year-old kid who still looked like I did in<span> </span><em>The Squid and the Whale</em>.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I reveal that moments before our call, I submitted<span> </span><em>The Squid and the Whale</em><span> </span>in my 10-film ballot for Sight amp; Sound’s prestigious Greatest Films poll, and that, to me,<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>mixes Baumbach’s bitter wit with the Safdie brothers’ unpredictable energy. When Robert brings Wallace (Matthew Maher), a cantankerous criminal, to his family home for Christmas, the humour is in the culture clash – like a Safdies character entering a Baumbach movie and smashing up the furniture.</p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m flattered you see those two things there,” Kline says<strong>.</strong><span> </span>“The movie is not autobiographical, but the fabric is. One personal element is that the character is very impressionable. When I was making<span> </span><em>The Squid and the Whale</em>, I was soaking up that experience like a sponge, and then with the Safdies, on their Red Bucket Films shorts, I was running around New York, getting thrown out of Chinese restaurants, filming actors through the glass. These experiences in troublemaking coalesced into the movie as well.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The acclaim that met<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>(it premiered at Cannes to a five-star review from the <em>Guardian</em>) suggests that Kline can stick with filmmaking if he wishes to, and he alludes to another comedy he’s written. Like Robert, though, Kline doesn’t seem like someone who wishes to produce mainstream material, especially given how<span> </span><em>Funny Pages</em><span> </span>concludes.

<h1 class="fl-title">Paddington Bear’s journey from Latinx icon to Tory mascot</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">At this point, Paddington Brown is no longer a bear – but a blank canvas onto which we project our anxieties about Britain’s future</h3>

<p><span>A few days ago, a florist in Manchester was robbed. A wooden statue of Paddington Bear was one of the items taken, prompting the owner, 54, to make a </span><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/09/13/florist-urges-thief-who-stole-paddington-bear-statue-to-return-it-17365564/"><span>plea</span></a><span> to the thief to return the wooden animal: “What would the Queen think? He is her best friend, and she wouldn’t have wanted this to happen to him.” </span></p>
<p><span>No, we’re not making this up. Swathes of people in the UK are convinced that the duo were IRL besties, hence the</span><span> </span><span>heaps of marmalade sandwiches and stuffed bears left outside the palace by mourners. The situation got so extreme that the Royal Parks of London issued a statement asking people to stop leaving sandwiches (Twitter theorised that the perishables were </span><a href="https://twitter.com/rorhor/status/1569241970438033409?s=20amp;t=ZP_UNAkXyYiSpfZR07BDvw"><span>attracting rodents</span></a><span>).</span></p>
<p><span>The internet is also flooded with tributes, and one particular <a href="https://twitter.com/CatsMcGhee/status/1567960208923828224">illustration</a> of the queen and the little bear walking into the sunset hand in hand – where Paddington, disturbingly, appears to be in the role of the grim reaper – has gone viral. There are innumerable TikToks, too: fancam-style videos overlaying clips of the now-infamous Jubilee sketch with doleful Lana Del Rey songs. </span><span>Even the </span>BBC<span> are feeding into this narrative: while all regular programming is currently suspended, the network will screen the </span><em><span>Paddington</span></em><span> movies on the evening before and on the day of the big funeral.</span></p><p><span>The association between the late monarch and the little bear is only a few months old. As part of the Queen’s Jubilee celebrations in June, she appeared alongside the anthropomorphic animal in a sketch created especially for the occasion. Nothing really happens in it – the pair have tea together and bond over their shared love of marmalade sandwiches – but it made a lasting impression on viewers. The creators of the sketch explained the collaboration by saying that the Queen and Paddington complement each other, as they both embody politeness and good manners, and are cut from the “</span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-62900264"><span>same cloth</span></a><span>”.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the release of the popular film series, Paddington has become a political symbol –seemingly antithetical to the Queen’s consistent insistence on the importance of presenting herself as apolitical. The bear, voiced by Ben Whishaw, graced the silver screen for the first time back in 2014, arriving in London from “Darkest Peru” and concealed in a boat (an undocumented immigrant!) The Brown family’s acceptance and welcoming of the little bear – despite his difficulties understanding the British way of life – is portrayed as Good, while the family’s xenophobic and sceptical neighbour, Mr Curry, is an unambiguous villain. The politicisation of Paddington didn’t go unmissed: one thinkpiece written in response to the movie was titled ‘</span><a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-paddington-is-anti-ukip-propaganda"><span>Why Paddington is anti-UKIP propaganda</span></a><span>’ while another saw an </span><a href="https://freemovement.org.uk/an-immigration-lawyer-reviews-paddington/"><span>immigration lawyer</span></a><span> review the film.</span></p><p><span>The second </span><em><span>Paddington</span></em><span> film was even more radical. Released in 2017, a time characterised by harsh anti-immigrant sentiment in the wake of Brexit and Trump’s election, the bear continued to make the case for multiculturalism and immigration. He even highlighted how the criminal justice system is biased against minority groups and strongly advocated for prison reform. The film went on to develop a cult following, and even briefly replaced </span><em><span>Citizen Kane</span></em><span> as the best movie on Rotten Tomatoes. Paddington had cemented his position as a symbol of liberal values such as acceptance and diversity.</span></p>
<p><span>But in recent months, the bear has undergone a bit of a rebrand – with the Queen’s Jubilee catalysing the change. “I think it’s an interesting politically informed decision that they chose Paddington, who is an illegal immigrant, to appear with the Queen over Winnie the Pooh who is British and just as well known,” explains Professor <a href="https://www.sunderland.ac.uk/about/staff/english/angelasmith/">Angela Smith</a>, a Professor of Language and Culture at the University of Sunderland, who published an academic study on Paddington’s immigrant status. </span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My favourite dead queen piccy has to be this one bc it insinuates that Paddington bear is the grim reaper for British people <a href="https://t.co/jfG6cc3Bao">pic.twitter.com/jfG6cc3Bao</a></p>mdash; Caito (@CatsMcGhee) <a href="https://twitter.com/CatsMcGhee/status/1567960208923828224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2022</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p><span>It’s not all down to the Jubilee sketch, though. It’s important to note the </span><em><span>kind</span></em><span> of immigrant that Paddington represents, even in the films. As James Greig writes in</span><span> </span><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/paddington-cancelled-queen-elizabeth-ii"><em><span>GQ</span></em></a><span>: “Not all migrants speak fluent English in a plummy accent, nor have they spent their lives obsessing over British culture, nor do they readily discard their real name because it’s too difficult for English people to understand.” Perhaps, the fictional bear has been so easily co-opted by pro-establishment conservatives because he’s been the archetypal Good Immigrant all along: he checks all their boxes </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> lets them believe they’re graciously welcoming an outsider. </span></p>
<p><span>As the left and right tussle over a small fictional bear, deep-seated political divisions in the country are brought to the fore. At this point, he’s less of a bear, and more of a political battleground – we’re in agreement that he represents ‘British values’, but what those values are is more contentious. Is he the kind of Brit who thinks our diversity is our greatest strength, who advocates for ‘multiculturalism’? Or is he the kind who thinks ‘knowing your place’ and respecting your social superiors are the most important virtues a person (or bear) can have? Well – that’s the beauty of a fictional character. He’s both, and neither. Maybe, with their innate political ambiguity and a shared “never explain, never complain” attitude, he and the Queen have more in common after all.</span></p>]]>

<p><span><a href="/lfw">London Fashion Week</a> is like the dumb, slutty, and really fun sister of the other fashion weeks. Having had the privilege and also the lack of self-worth to attend fashion week in all of the big four cities – that’s <a href="/nyfw">New York</a>, <a href="/pfw">Paris</a>, <a href="/mfw">Milan</a>, London for those not in the know – at least once in my sad little life, I have to admit that London is leaps and bounds ahead of all the others in terms of vibe. </span></p>
<p><span>Sure, New York might be (getting) cool(er), Milan is aggressive and quite sexy but it’s also very lonely, and Paris is admittedly chic but terrifying, but London just has slutty dumb punk vibes with a sprinkling of intellect and loads of heart. And who doesn’t want that?</span></p><p><span>The others may have massive budgets, and, like, </span><a href="/chloe-sevigny"><span>Chloë</span></a><span><a href="/chloe-sevigny"> Sevigny</a> telling me “no” when I asked if she had a lighter and I’d just watched her use for her own cigarette, but London has a distinctly low budget feel. And while this might sound less glamorous, does glamour even really exist any more? And if it did, is that really what you want from your fashion?</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>Surely what we all crave from actual decent fashion worth the runway it walks on is for it to do even one of the following: make you laugh; make you feel really hot, sexy, and good!; make you feel like you can do anything and wear anything and that everyone wants to fuck you; make you feel included and not like shit (this isn’t the 90s!); make you feel like you don’t need to lose weight or change your body; make you feel really proud that fashion – one of the greatest loves of your life, for some strange reason to do with transformation – has the ability to actually begin conversations of change. It might not get it right every time, but it certainly has the potential to learn, and relearn, and learn some more. </span></p><blockquote>
<p><span>“Surely what you want from actual decent fashion worth the runway it walks on is for it to do even one of the following: make you laugh; make you feel really hot, sexy, and good; make you feel like you can do anything and wear anything and that everyone wants to fuck you; make you feel included and not like shit – this isn’t the 90s!” </span></p>
</blockquote><p><span>This, I now know for sure, is what I want from fashion. In fact, I don’t want glamour or bitchiness or exclusivity. Fashion week is famous for that, but that’s so dull, and if there’s one thing I learned during my foray on the frow at Paris couture week some five years ago now, it’s that seemingly those closest to the centre, the ones who get angry when they don’t have the ‘right’ seat, who love the exclusion – and who dress that up as glamour – are by far the most dull people it’s possible to meet. So dull that if you were stuck in a smoking area with them you’d wish you were at home unloading the dishwasher (if you’re lucky enough to have one) and filing your taxes. </span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>But in London this isn’t the vibe. Honest to God. It’s no wonder it’s known as the punkier city because the parties happen in warehouses XD, it rains no matter the season so everyone looks wet and smells like dog, and there’s loads of initiatives to make sure young talent actually gets to be involved on the schedule right next to big guns like <a href="/burberry">Burberry</a>. </span><span>It’s the only fashion week I’ve been fingered at, it’s the only one where the poshest editor you know can be overheard talking about the “coke poo” she did the morning after a [redacted magazine title] party; and it’s the only fashion week where proper mad creativity is at its centre. </span></p><blockquote>
<p><span>“Take me to Paris, meet me in Milan, we’ll do dinner in New York – lmao inspirational quote xxx – but let’s get fucked up in London and make a dress out of a blow up swimming pool and some duct tape”</span></p>
</blockquote><p><span>It’s something to do with budgets and initiatives, as well as the fact people in London are quite happy to schlep across the whole city to shows in cheaper spaces, but no other city has bred brands like <a href="/vivienne-westwood">Westwood</a>, <a href="/alexander-mcqueen">McQueen</a>, <a href="/sibling">Sibling</a>, <a href="/gareth-pugh">Gareth Pugh</a>, <a href="/charles-jeffrey">Charles Jeffrey</a>, <a href="/matty-bovan">Matty Bovan</a>, <a href="/rottingdean-bazaar">Rottingdean Bazaar</a>, HRH, <a href="/craig-green">Craig Green</a>, <a href="/mowalola">Mowalola</a>, <a href="/maximilian">Maximilian</a>, <a href="/grace-wales-bonner">Wales Bonner</a>, </span><a href="/sinead-o-dwyer">Sinéad O'Dwyer</a>, <a href="/meadham-kirchoff">Meadham Kirchoff</a>, <span><a href="/christopher-kane">Christopher Kane</a>, <a href="/charlotte-knowles">KNWLS</a>, <a href="/supriya-lele">Supriya Lele</a>, <a href="/asai">ASAI</a>, <a href="/simone-rocha">Simone Rocha</a>, <a href="/saul-nash">Saul Nash</a>, and endless, endless others. Nobody has an ability to self-deprecate and party like the London set (and still make it to the first show of the morning), and it’s this relationship with both humour and sincerity which make London the fashion week with by far the most vibes. </span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>In all honesty, clothes aren’t really that interesting when looked at on a conveyor belt. Clothes are about emotion, communication, ideas. And while so much of fashion is about big business, London has never lost its underbelly of freaks and outsiders who come to the big cities, go out clubbing, and make fucking insane clothes in which to do so. </span></p>
<p><span>When everything else is so grim, we’ll always have the party, and we’ll always have the legendary fashion that comes out of it and onto our runways. Take me to Paris, meet me in Milan, we’ll do dinner in New York (lmao inspirational quote xxx) but let’s get fucked up in London and make a dress out of a blow up swimming pool and some duct tape. You truly have to j’adore. </span></p>]]>

<p><a href="/tag/telfar"><span>Telfar</span></a><span> shopping bags are famously in demand, making getting your hands on one a near to impossible task. But on Sunday evening every single colour and size was stocked at a pop-up for one night only.</span></p>
<p><span>As part of the chaos of New York Fashion Week, the pop-up took place in downtown Brooklyn at the American retail store </span><em><span>Rainbow</span></em><span>. Despite the rain, customers began queuing three hours before the store opened, creating a line-up that circled around the entire block. The crowd was far from just native New Yorkers, though, with people hailing from all over the country, including Pennsylvania and California, just to get their hands on their very own </span><a href="/fashion/article/50151/1/telfar-clemens-secure-the-bag-program-presale-bushwick-birkin-instagram-preorder"><span>Bushwick Birkin</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>Amid the chaos, we sent out our resident street style photographer </span><a href="/tag/yu-fujiwara"><span>Yu Fujiwara</span></a><span> to photograph the beauty and madness of the event. The images depict everything from the rows of umbrellas, to hosts of Telfar TV, including TikTok star </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/trapselyna/"><span>Selyna Brillare</span></a><span> – also known as @trapselyna. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Elsewhere, other pics show Telfar fans screaming with pure joy after purchasing their bag, accessorised with their own waterproof bagging. Despite the five-bag limit, by the end of the event, there was still a long line of people who were not able to get in. However, for those who could not get their shopping bag, fear not. The label announced a restock of all the colours arriving online in the next few weeks.</span></p>
<p>Get to know the stans waiting in line to get their hands on a new bag below. </p><h1><strong>TREASURE, @TREZZIE 20</strong></h1>	<figure>

<p><strong>What brought you out here today? </strong></p>
<p><span>The pop-up has all the colours and sizes, and I did <em>not</em> want to miss out on the opportunity because when they sell out online, they sell out real fast. </span></p>
<p><strong>How many do you have already?</strong></p>
<p><span>I have this one, this one and this one only, but I want to have a collection because I’m a girly girl and I like collecting bags!</span></p>
<p><strong>Which one are you hoping to get your hands on today? </strong></p>
<p><span>I want a small white and a small tan one. The one I <em>really</em> want is the white one. </span></p>
<h1><strong>GABBY, RAKAYAH, amp; JHENESIS, @GABBYTHANDIWE, @PINKINTHECITI, amp; @JHENESISHINES_</strong></h1>	<figure>

<p><strong>How many bags are you planning to get today?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gabby:</strong><span> I’m hoping to get one for myself and one for my friend. </span></p>
<p><strong>Rakayah:</strong><span> I’m planning to get two to three for myself. </span></p>
<p><strong>Jhenesis:</strong><span> I just want to get one for my mum. </span></p>
<p><strong>Which colours do you want?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Gabby:</strong><span> Either cream or azalea. But I was looking at the metallic colours and my friend wants the bubblegum pink.</span></p>
<p><strong>Rakayah:</strong><span> Azalea, black, and also white.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jhenesis:</strong><span> I’m looking at the medium tan, medium cream or the navy. </span></p>
<p><strong>What was the last meme you saved on your phone?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Rakayah:</strong><span> Mine was about the death of Queen Elizabeth. It was like boyfriend’s telling their girlfriend, I heard the queen is dead, are you okay?</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Gabby: </strong><span>Oh my god, it was also about the Queen. It was like Irish, Indian, Kenyan, Nigerian, South African, and Caribbean twitter right now joining hands celebrating. </span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Jhenesis: </strong><span>Honestly, my last meme was just a guy in New York standing in front of a car and the car was just honking at him for two minutes straight. </span></p>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Yu Fujiwara </span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>Which bag are you hoping to get today?</strong></p>
<p><span>I want a small one because I’ve worn this one out and I want a small going out bag, maybe. </span></p>
<p><strong>What is your favourite thing about Telfar?</strong></p>
<p><span>I wrote an art history paper on Telfar because I’m obsessed with it. There’s this thing where it’s not for you, it’s for everyone, and I love that. </span></p>
<h1><strong>BIBI, ZETA amp; NICOLE, @AMOEBUH, @YUNG_SISTA amp; @NICOLEMBIBI</strong></h1>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330114.jpg" alt="Telfar Fashion Week Pop-up" />		<figcaption>
			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Yu Fujiwara </span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>Do you own any Telfar bags yet?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bibi: </strong>Not yet. </p>
<p><strong>Zeta: </strong>Nope, not yet. </p>
<p><strong>Nicole:</strong><span> I have two, the medium white one and the small green. </span></p>
<p><strong>Which ones do you want?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bibi: </strong><span>I just want to go in and see which one pops the most. I want something bright, so many a yellow or a blue or a pink. </span></p>
<p><strong>Zeta: </strong><span>I want the silver or chrome blue in medium. </span></p>
<p><strong>Nicole: </strong><span>I’m looking for either a yellow one or the painter’s blue one in large, and my friend wants a small chocolate one. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why do you love Telfar?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bibi:</strong><span> I love the story it took to get to this point and all the energy behind the content that they are producing right now. I really like the way they present their products and the way they keep everyone involved, the whole Telfar community. </span></p>
<p><strong>Zeta:</strong><span> I love that it’s Black-owned and the vision behind it. I love the collaborations and I love those bags that you cannot get from other places. Marc Jacobs is not going to come out with a chrome blue bag or a stark silver bag, you know?</span></p>
<p><strong>If you were to come back as a ghost what would you be wearing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bibi:</strong><span> It would be Telfar head to toe!</span> <span></span></p>
<p><strong>Zeta: </strong><span>Oh you have to stay in that forever! I have these bootleg flare camo pants that are lowrise with a bunch of pockets on them, for sure that with a black turtleneck crop, the Telfar one, and then probably a chunky black loather. </span></p>
<h1><strong>DANTE, @DANTELARMONT </strong></h1>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330111.jpg" alt="Telfar Fashion Week Pop-up" />		<figcaption>
			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Yu Fujiwara </span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>How many Telfar bags do you have already?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante: </strong><span>The bubblegum pink! It was my favourite. I got it and I’m just here for my partner now. Picture the story: I was at work, a miserable, terrible day. I was like I shouldn’t check my phone, but I looked down at my phone at 12pm and was like ‘Oh my God’ bubblegum pink dropped again. I got my bag! Boom, it came. This is my first bag and I always wanted a Telfar. </span></p>
<p><strong>What brought you out here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante: </strong><span>I really came here for my partner because he doesn't have a bag yet. He really loves lime green. </span></p>
<p><strong>If you could describe your personal style as one animated film character who would it be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante: </strong><span>My style is very Black. It’s all over the place. I’m a motherfucking faggot, I’m punk, I’m nerdy as fuck. It would be some type of anime character. I would be, I don’t know… I have a cute <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> shirt and it’s yellow as fuck. He’s doing his spirit gun and that’s my motherfucking style – fun. </span></p>
<p><strong>What do you love the most about Telfar?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dante: </strong><span>I love that they’re Black. Really as a random ass bitch, I love their insistence on being first and foremost in terms of fashion and doing your thing. It started in Brooklyn and now they’re having a release at Rainbow!</span></p>]]>

<p><span><a href="/tag/dev-hynes">Dev Hynes</a> / <a href="/tag/blood-orange">Blood Orange</a> has released his first new music since 2019. </span><span>The EP, titled <em>Four Songs</em>, was written and produced by Hynes himself, and features collaborations with Ian Isaiah, Eva Tolkin and Erika de Casier. I'll leave you to guess how many songs it has. </span></p>
<p><span>Throughout the 2010s, Hynes established himself as one of the most acclaimed songwriters and sought-after producers in the music industry. Alongside his own albums, he has produced tracks for an impressive array of stars, including <a href="/tag/sky-ferreira">Sky Ferreira</a> (he produced her breakout hit “Everything is Embarrassing”), <a href="/tag/solange">Solange</a>, Carly Rae Jepsen, Kylie Monogue and <a href="/tag/fka-twigs">FKA Twigs</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Since his last release, 2019’s mixtape <em>Angel Pulse</em>, Hynes has been focused on writing soundtracks and scoring films and TV: he has worked on Luca Guadagnino's <em>We Are Who We Are</em>;<em> </em></span><span>Gia Coppolla’s 2020 film <em>Mainstream</em>, A24’s road movie <em>Queen and Slim</em>, HBO Drama series <em>In Treatment</em>,  and a Netflix documentary about tennis player Naomi Osaka. In 2021, he received a Grammy nomination for “Best Chamber Music/  Small Ensemble Performance” for <em>Fields</em>, a classical musical collaboration which was performed by Third Coast Production.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Four Songs</em> feels like vintage Blood Orange: downbeat, sultry, sharply produced and a little melancholy in parts. Hynes has recently been supporting Harry Styles on his 15-show run at New York’s Madison Square Gardens, which suggests his hiatus from public life has come to an end. Back in 2020, he <a href="https://www.anothermanmag.com/life-culture/10211/dev-hynes-confirms-new-blood-orange-album-is-done">said that</a> a new full-length album was already completed, so watch this space. </span></p>
<p><span>Listen to all four of the new tracks below.</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Amazon is making a Blade Runner TV show</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The ‘provocative’ new series, set in 2099, will continue the story of the first two films</h3>

<p>Amazon has <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/amazon-blade-runner-2099-tv-series-pickup-1235220944/">announced</a> that it’s producing a “provocative” new series based on <em>Blade Runner</em>, the iconic 1982 science fiction film.</p>
<p>Ridley Scott, who directed the original, has signed on as executive producer, and the series will be helmed by Silka Rosa, who was the showrunner for Apple+’s critically acclaimed serial killer thriller <em>The Shining Girls, </em>and who also worked on the TV adaptation of video game<em> Halo.</em></p>
<p>The new series, titled <em>Blade Runner 2099, </em>will follow the events of the 2017 sequel<em> Blade Runner 2049,</em> which was directed by Denise Villeneuve. As of now, no further details about the story have been announced.</p>
<p>The co-founders of Alcon Entertainment, which will be producing the show, said: “We recognise that we have a very high bar to meet with this next instalment. Together with Silka and our partners at Amazon, and Scott Free Productions, we hope that we can live up to that standard and delight audiences with the next generation of Blade Runner.”</p>
<p>Widely considered a cult classic, the original <em>Blade Runner </em>is set in 2019 (which, at the time, was “the future”) in a noirish, cyberpunk LA. It stars Harrison Ford as Deckard, a policeman tasked with hunting down a group of runaway “replicants” – robots who are indistinguishable from humans. The sequel, <em>Blade Runner 2049, </em>stars Ryan Gosling as a replicant who uncovers an explosive secret and has to track down Deckard. Both films are visually stunning, and it will be interesting to see whether the Amazon series will be able to match their high aesthetic standards.</p>]]>

<p><span>At some point across the summer, sitting in her downtown New York studio, 31-year-old designer Kim Nguyen was watching an old YouTube video of </span><a href="/tag/kim-gordon"><span>Kim Gordon</span></a><span>’s 1994 X-girl show. Produced by </span><a href="/tag/sofia-coppola"><span>Sofia Coppola</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/tag/spike-jonze"><span>Spike Jonze</span></a><span>, with models like </span><a href="/tag/chloe-sevigny"><span>Chloë Sevigny</span></a><span> and baby Padma Lakshmi walking, she decided she wanted to recreate the energy in the same NY streets with her own fledgling line </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/nguyeninc/?hl=en"><span>Nguyen Inc.</span></a></p>
<p><span>Born in the throes of the pandemic and named for obvious reasons, the label is a love letter to her Vietnamese heritage and her skate and street adolescence. Bold colours, poppy fonts, and her love of crochet make it into the mix, with her signature corset tee becoming something of an Instagram buzz item, with styles selling out within hours. </span></p><p><span>This week, in the twilight hours of NYFW, Kim introduced the world to the rest of the Nguyen universe with a guerilla show that took over Chinatown. There were panelled babydoll dresses in sugar-rush shade of pink, barely-there minis, and floor-sweeping dresses studded with black sequins, alongside the shrunken logo tees that made her name. Smudged, dark, Karen O eyes and worked-in rocker hair spoke to a devil-may-care spirit, even if you don’t happen to live in Dimes Square. </span></p>
<p><span>The collection, entitled </span><em><span>Ham Choi</span></em><span>, a Vietnamese term for doing too much, speaks to the grey area in-between exhibitionism and YOLO energy. Speaking to Dazed, Kim breaks down how Nguyen Inc. has been her whole life in the making.</span></p><p><strong>What's your first memory of fashion? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>When  I was growing up, my mum worked at a nail salon. She still does. I always went to work with her because she was working all the time. I would sit there for hours in the reception area looking at fashion magazines, so that's how it started. I remember pronouncing</span><em><span> Harper's Bazaar</span></em><span>, “Harper's Bay-zare”. I think I was around eight years old and drawing dresses to show her clients and ask if they wanted to buy them. How cute is that? So that's how it started. </span></p>
<p><strong>I see so many influences in your clothing. It's the first insight into your world. What were you into when you were younger?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>I think as far as fashion goes, Marc Jacobs was always my favourite designer growing up. I always said I want to work for that man. Then in high school I hung out with like all the skaters and that probably had a bit of an influence on me. I grew up watching a lot of music videos too, every morning before getting driven to school, I always had MTV on. I did that every morning.</span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Quentin Belt</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>You ended up working for Marc as well as Supreme. I want to talk about both of those experiences, because I think it's really interesting to understand how they set you up for what you are doing now.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>The first time I interned for Marc Jacobs was my second year [of college] in 2012 or 2013. I was interning for the shoe design team, and then I worked there as an assistant for shoe design. Out of all of the people that I've interned or worked for, I really consider Marc Jacobs an artist, more so than a fashion designer. It wasn't necessarily about “what's going to make us a lot of money”, he was more concerned with what was visually appealing to him, and did it convey his vision. That was really important for me to see. The late hours before the runway show, working non-stop. The hand-sewing things and sketching. </span></p>
<p><span>With Supreme, I was seeing someone at the time that had mentioned they were looking for designers at Supreme. I'm telling this story because I don't think I ever really sought out to work at Supreme. It just sort of happened. And I'm so grateful that it did. I would've never even imagined that was a possibility for me. It's such an iconic brand and in some ways unattainable? And you know, rightfully so. </span></p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to start your own brand?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>I was at Supreme for a couple years and I worked really hard there. It was a small team and I really wanted to get my voice heard. I felt I was evolving and if I had stayed there it would've been fine like for the next five years to be working at Supreme. But I just realised I didn’t want to be doing this for someone else for this long and I thought I would like to start my own brand.</span></p>
<p><strong>And now you’ve decided to go against what most people do, in that you’ve drip-fed little glimpses of stuff on your Instagram. Obviously your collaboration with Ganni got your name out there, and they’ve been incredibly supportive of you as a designer and your way of thinking. But your show is going to introduce a lot more people to your brand. Why was now the time? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>I just think it was intuitive. It really felt like I had to do this now. Maybe I should be a little more calculated in the things that I do, but a lot of what I do is based on intuition. I feel like the universe has really been able to provide me with the right amount of support for this very moment. </span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Quentin Belt</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>What is this collection about at large?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>The collection is called </span><em><span>Ham Choi</span></em><span>, which is Vietnamese for “you play too much” essentially. It’s not a direct translation but loosely that's what it is. My parents are polar opposites. My mum is a homebody and my dad is 75 and still likes to have fun with his friends and so I asked them what joy means to them. They had such different responses and I wanted to capture those responses within the show. </span></p>
<p><span>The collection itself is broken up into three sections, the first category being all white outfits, and then the middle section being super multicoloured, very bright, punchy saturated colours. And the ending category of outfits are all black. The white represents a blank canvas, colour the energy I’ve accumulated since I started, and then black is where I think I am going. </span></p>
<p><span>I started the brand in 2020 with the fitted t- shirt, and with my experience working in streetwear, it felt like a natural place to begin making my own thing. Now it’s evolved, and for this collection I wanted to really push and only use upcycled t-shirt material. I thought of it as a challenge. And I also remember listening to an interview with Gaetano Pesce where he discusses some of the stigma of using colour and how it can be seen as low-class. I want to show that colour can be elegant. There’s always something about my work about proving something wrong.</span></p>	<figure>

			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Quentin Belt</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><strong>The fabric is all upcycled but do you consider yourself a sustainable brand? Are you comfortable with that label?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>There’s a great quote from Rei Kawakubo about the brands they choose to carry at Dover Street Market and she mentioned she admires brands that just do the same thing and keep it consistent. I’ve really been thrifting and making things into different items for years. Going to Goodwill because I don’t come from a lot or have a family who knows a lot about fashion or art. We were more about “let’s try to survive and put food on the table”. </span></p>
<p><strong>New York has a lineage of amazing Asian American designers who have brought their own culture to the forefront of US fashion. I think your story will be a part of that as well. I’m interested in why it was so important to you to bring your culture into what you were doing?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>Well, my parents both escaped Vietnam. My dad fought in the war and had to escape or else he’d probably have been arrested. They came to America for a better life and so while I am maybe more American-ised than other Vietnamese brands, I can say I am learning something new about my culture everyday. I am getting a little emotional even talking about it because through making this collection, I’ve become so much closer to my parents.</span><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Finally, who would you say Nguyen Inc is for?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Kim Nguyen: </strong><span>Do you remember when Alexander McQueen said he wanted people to be fucking  terrified of the women he dressed because they were so powerful? I see a part of that in what I want to do. I just want the girls to look powerful and good. And fucking cool!</span><span><br /></span></p>	<figure>

<h1 class="fl-title">New Music Friday: 5 albums to stream this week</h1>

<p><span>Kai Whiston is one of those artists whose presence can be felt across the pop landscape. Having produced tracks for the likes of <a href="/music/article/51076/1/shygirl-interview-autumnwinter-2020-issue-alias">Shygirl</a>, <a href="/music/article/55752/1/dazed-mix-vtss-producer-fast-techno-ninja-tune">VTSS</a>, <a href="/tag/coucou-chloe">Coucou Chloe</a>, <a href="/tag/tommy-cash">Tommy Cash</a> and <a href="/tag/dorian-electra">Dorian Electra</a>, the 23-year-old has already scored a distribution deal with Universal for his label Lux Recordings, while his educational platform Lux Cache boasts alumni such as Oneohtrix Point Never and Jimmy Edgar. </span></p>
<p><span>His third studio album, </span><em><span>Quiet As Kept F.O.G.</span></em><span>, is an intimate reflection of his experiences growing up as part of the New Age Traveller community. Across 10 tracks, Whiston takes listeners on a beautifully atmospheric journey of self-discovery as he reconciles himself with the childhood he spent his teenage years resenting, combining elements of 90s rave with fantastical soundscapes and orchestral interludes. Part documentary, part myth, Whiston bares all – and it’s worth every moment.</span></p>

<p><span>After months of convoluted Instagram posts complaining about his partnership with GAP – and something about refusing to speak to people who are more broke than he is – </span><a href="/tag/kanye-west"><span>Kanye West</span></a><span> has officially terminated his contract with the American mall brand. The whole thing was instigated because GAP was refusing to release product drops or open </span><a href="/tag/yeezy"><span>Yeezy</span></a><span> outlets as planned. From this point henceforth, no further collaborations will be created, but GAP will continue to sell the remainder of its Yeezy stock. RIP to a real one! You made the perfect hoodie. To fill the void left by swamping t-shirts and alienoid sunglasses, however, is a private school called the Donda academy. </span></p>
<p><span>Dressed in Yeezy GAP uniforms, the mission of the Christian prep school is to “prepare students to become the next generation of leaders” through “an ethic of integrity and care.” Families are forced to sign NDAs and kids are forced to partake in Parkour classes, and the whole thing is part of a five-year plan to </span><span>have several campuses across the country, and a Donda university.

<p>Following the release of the joint album <em>Crest</em> earlier this year, <a href="/tag/drain-gang">Bladee</a> is back with a new solo record, <em>Spiderr,</em> out September 30. </p>
<p>Cryptic as always, the Swedish artist announced the release via Instagram stories with a link to the music video for new single “Drain Story“, directed by fellow Drain Gang member Ecco2k and produced by Whitearmor. In the video, Bladee is wandering through his hometown Stockholm, singing: “<em>Can’t fit in with the normies/ If being drainy is a sin, Lord, forgive me</em>.“</p>
<p>The announcement follows on from last year’s solo album <em>The Fool</em>, which landed in <a href="/music/article/55087/1/the-best-albums-of-2021">Dazed’s best albums of 2021</a>.

<h1 class="fl-title">Does this perfume really smell like the person you’re missing?</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">We asked everyone at the Dazed office whether the viral Tiktok perfume, Phlur’s Missing Person, actually smells like someone they love – this is what they said</h3>

	</figure>
<p><span>Can a perfume recreate the smell of the person you are missing? <a href="/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> thinks so. Earlier this year, users on the app went wild over a fragrance that they said evokes the scent of someone that you love or miss. So much so that the hashtag now has over 4M views. At the time the perfume in question – <a href="https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/phlur-missing-person-eau-de-parfum-50ml_R04009748/">Phlur’s Missing Person</a> – was only available in the US. But this week it finally arrived in the UK and we here at Dazed HQ had the chance to test it out for ourselves.  </span></p>
<p><span>Missing Person is described by the brand’s creative director Chriselle Lim as an “addictive fragrance – like the lingering scent of your lover’s skin left on their t-shirt or a pillowcase. It’s evocative but strangely familiar. It will warm your skin and heal your soul.” The perfume blends a top note of “skin musk” with bergamot, jasmine, sandalwood and neroli blossom for a warm scent that is sometimes floral, sometimes musky.   </span></p>
<p><span>The internet hype for the fragrance started when Rachel Rigler </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rachelrigler/video/7070592933438786862"><span>reviewed it</span></a><span> on TikTok in March and then had </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rachelrigler/video/7071721505926778155"><span>her boyfriend</span></a><span> give his reactions as well. Calling Missing Person the “most interesting perfume I have ever smelled in my life”, Rigler says she can’t even begin to describe the feelings it gives her. “It smells like the feeling of being in love and it’s very familiar.” She then filmed her boyfriend who upon smelling the fragrance for the first time said, “that’s bizarre… it smells like you… fresh out of the shower… in a robe.”</span></p><p><span>Things really kicked off though when make-up artist Mikayla Nogueira bought a bottle in response to seeing Rigler’s video and </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mikaylanogueira/video/7071707664631369006"><span>posted her own reaction</span></a><span> to her 13.4 million followers. “That is fucking crazy,” she says. “I don’t know how to explain this, it smells like a person that you love and that you miss,” she continues as she starts tearing up. Five hours later the perfume was completely sold out and racked up a waiting list of over 200,000 customers desperate to try it for themselves.  </span></p>
<p><span>Since then TikTok has been flooded with reviews for the scent. </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@haleypham/video/7075374801690397994"><span>Hayley Pham</span></a><span> said memories of family gatherings came flooding back when she smelled it, including being hugged by her aunts and cigarette smoke. TikTok user </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tik.tok.tina/video/7074014008629841198"><span>@tik.tok.tina</span></a><span> was brought to tears. “Why is this making me emotional?” she asks. “You know when you’re cuddling with someone that you really love and you’re nestled up in their chest and you look up at them – it smells like that.”</span></p>
<p><span>So what’s the verdict from the office? My first reaction to Missing Person was that it smells like someone wearing a strong perfume who has just smoked several cigarettes. It reminds me a lot of </span><a href="/beauty/article/46688/1/hedi-slimanes-new-celine-perfumes-are-an-ode-to-his-hometown-paris"><span>Celine’s ‘Nightclubbing’</span></a><span> and also my Godmother. The fragrance smelled different on almost everyone who tested it and everyone had a different reaction to it as well, with responses split.</span></p>
<p><span>Our contributing features writer Halima said the fragrance smelled exactly like her mum. Florence, the project manager at Nowness, had a similar familial response, saying it reminded her of her sister’s perfume. Others, however, were less convinced. Our senior editor Dominique thought it smelled like fresh laundry, but said that it didn’t remind her of anyone, while AnOther’s social editor George also named linen as the smell. Sophie, brand partnerships director, said it didn’t remind her of anyone but it did evoke the feeling of home for her – comforting, like getting a hug.</span><span></span></p><p><span>Opinion was mixed over whether the fragrance was feminine or masculine. Several people described the scent as floral, with Nowness’s video editor Harry throwing in baby wipes. Baby powder was another offered suggestion. Many, however, felt it was quite a masculine scent. Culture coordinator Eddie described the fragrance as smelling like books but in a “sexy, male” way. Jess, project manager, said gasoline. </span></p>
<p><span>Producer Sam did say it reminded him of someone he is missing, as did digital director Harry, who added that the scent was musky and flowery, likening it to his granddad’s old house. Director of communications Sophie smelt nothing at all (maybe she is missing herself?)</span></p>
<p><span>Overall, it was a split verdict. Half the office described the fragrance as smelling like cigarettes, while the other half thought it was fresh and laundered. Several did feel it evoked a specific person or memory but just as many were left a bit baffled. Some thought it was very floral and feminine, while others felt it was masculine and musky. </span></p>
<p><span>So, why is Missing Person provoking so many emotions in people on and off TikTok? My best guess is that it has combined the scent of cigarettes, perfume and fresh laundry which when blended smells like clothing worn by someone. For people who have a loved one who smokes, a fabulous aunt who loads up on the Chanel No 5 and Marlborough Lights, for example, the scent will recall someone specific. Those who don’t might be more drawn to the laundry smell and think of the clothing they spend most time nestled up in – a boyfriend or girlfriend. The only way to truly know is to try it yourself.</span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">CLIP is making sad girl rap for introverts</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">We speak to the emerging artist about her debut EP, going viral overnight, and the importance of expressing yourself</h3>

	<figure>

<p><span>For any musician who came up in the pandemic, the rush to IRL recognition can be particularly head-spinning – and no one knows this better than CLIP. The 23-year-old is fast becoming an IT girl in New York’s downtown scene, known for her untouchably hot aesthetic and terminally online take on sad girl rap. </span></p>
<p><span>“Music wasn’t something I wanted to do but something I enjoyed doing,” she tells me over FaceTime. “It’s my happy place.” Running away from her home in Texas to the city at the age of 16, CLIP went viral overnight with her 2020 track “Sad B!tch”. “</span><span>My life was very chaotic and crazy. My parents weren’t ready for a family but they had one anyway – and shit happens,” she explains. “I had to make a lot of sacrifices because I felt there was more to life than my situation.”</span></p>
<p><span>It was upon moving to New York that she cultivated a group of friends and artists, including former digicore artists angelus and midwxst, and formed the collective Burn All Sex Dolls. “Small towns are more conservative and less accepting of people just being themselves, whereas in New York, you can literally be whoever the fuck you want – and no one’s going to make you feel bad for it.” </span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="t9PhOCTov0E"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9PhOCTov0E" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Listening to a CLIP track seems upbeat at first: the trancey synth lines and distorted production feel exciting in that chaotic-internet-remix-culture kinda way. But it’s the songwriting that hits the hardest: diaristic and deeply personal reflections on trauma, intimacy and loneliness that, cloaked in the rapper’s dismissive delivery and monotone vocals, can easily pass the uninitiated by. “When I was younger it was really hard for me to express my emotions. I caused myself a lot of inner turmoil because I didn’t know how to let out my feelings,” she says. “If you keep bottling it up, it’s going to hurt inside because you’re never going to embrace your true self.”</span></p>
<p><span>It’s something she wants to untangle on her debut EP </span><em><span>Perception</span></em><span>, a selection of nine tracks that aim to give listeners a deeper look at CLIP’s inner world beyond the viral hits and buzzy social media presence. “I titled the EP </span><em><span>Perception </span></em><span>because I feel like no one really has a correct grasp of the person I am,” she agrees. Cloaked in CLIP’s monotone vocals, she combines emotionally turbulent lyrics with chaotic production that feels</span><span> guarded yet vulnerable. </span><span>“If you get it, you get it.”</span></p>
<p>Perception<em> is out now</em></p>]]>

<p><span>In the process of every revolution, there comes a time when mainstream history needs to be revised. </span><span>So it’s no surprise that, three years after a photo went viral of two surfers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/28/world-surf-league-criticised-over-gender-pay-gap-for-junior-surfers">holding unequal prize cheques</a> (the boy’s double the amount of the girls), a new documentary is addressing the origins of female competitive surfing and setting all the records straight.</span></p>
<p><span><em>Girls Can’t Surf</em> is a riotous, fun, impassioned 108 minutes of women, waves and neon-framed speed shades. It takes us back to the birth of international competitive surfing in the 80s and, for the first time on screen, tells the story from the perspective of the underdogs. Although women had been included on the World Tour since its inauguration, they had remained a tokenistic part of it – paid a fraction of the men’s prize money, traditionally competing where the waves were terrible, usually at a point in the day where spectators would leave, and barely with any documentation or remuneration.</span></p>
<p><span>Considering all that, it’s a miracle that there was any source material to work with at all. </span><span>“[Finding] the archive was easily the most difficult thing,” says director Christopher Nelius, a seasoned advertising and documentary director who’s been immersed in the surf world since he first picked up a board in his early twenties. “Back in the 80s, no one really photographed the women’s events, let alone filmed them… thankfully, as it went into the 90s, it was hitting that affordable home video camera world.”</span></p><p><span>The footage they did find was more than worth the scouring: there’s 1993 World Champ Pauline Menczer selling Levis out the back of a van to survive; Jodie Cooper’s majestic World Cup win at Sunset in Hawaii, 1985; Freida Zamba icing out the competition with aggressive cutbacks (and the most iconic muscle beach fits ever), and Lisa Anderson winning World Titles with one hand and feeding her newborn daughter with the other. There are perfect waves, podiums, after parties, laughs and tears. All of it is woven together poetically, painting a picture of a community that has largely been excluded from the professional surfing narrative. </span></p>
<p><span>Nelius had witnessed a lot of it from the sidelines but was still surprised by the personal challenges that came to light through his research. “Two things stand out,” he says. “[Australian surfer] Pam [Burridge] opening up about her battles with anorexia and drinking. And Jodie [Cooper] talking about the homophobia she experienced once she came out. There are actually a couple of stories that didn’t make it into the film that would make your blood boil.” </span></p>
<p><span>“I didn’t expect to learn about just how heroic those women were, [and] all in different ways. You could make a film about any of their life stories. Like [World Champion] Layne Beachley, for example, who is adopted and used that to be a driver to be a world champion and one of the greatest surfers of all time.”</span><span></span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="1qPqMJfGS1o"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1qPqMJfGS1o" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Another thing that stands out in the film is how long things took to change, even after the industry realised it could make a lot of money out of selling surf culture to women: brands like Roxy, Billabong Girls and O’Neill’s female division all proved to be extremely lucrative (at one point Roxy was outselling Quiksilver and making $600 million a year). But still, this success did not trickle through to the women on the front line. </span><span></span><span>“You would have thought that [the Roxy boom] would have changed the game,” says Nelius, “[but] it was still the men who were running the show... They had to fight in an almost suffragette way to have decent waves to surf in front of the cameras, to have money, to have all those boardroom battles they went through… It’s no coincidence in my mind that equal pay happened when there was a female CEO at the World Surf League. You’ve got to have women in power in order to make that change.”</span></p>
<p><span>But change did eventually come. Go to any surfing beach now and you’ll see almost half women and men in the lineup, with seven-time world champion Stephanie Gilmore considered one of the most idolised and respected athletes in the world. The furore around equal prize money in 2018, and the World Surf League’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/07/world-surf-league-gender-pay-gap#:~:text=Three%20months%20and%20a%20lot,will%20receive%20equal%20prize%20money.">resulting decision</a> to commit to equal pay, has made competitive surfing a progressive sport again – making it the only American-based global sports organisation to have fixed the gender pay gap. This inclusivity at the highest level changes the face of surfing culture and opens the door for a whole new generation. While competitive surfing has historically not been that ethnically diverse, new organisations like <a href="https://www.texturedwaves.com/">Textured Waves</a> and <a href="https://browngirlsurf.com/">Brown Girl Surf</a> in Oakland, SF, are also continuing to push the sport forward.</span></p><blockquote>
<p>“<span>[I hope that] young men understand how the world is a better place when women are given that space to flourish... Even just the athletic ability of women is going to go nuts, and you’re going to see that in football too”</span></p>
</blockquote><p><span>“The women’s side being lifted has already changed the identity of surfing, and it will only continue to do that,” says Nelius. “It will lead to new ideas and new possibilities that we can’t imagine, which would be limited by a purely male-dominated version of the sport. [I hope that] young men watch the film and understand how the world is a better place when women are supported and given that space to flourish. It just made surfing heaps better... Even just the athletic ability of women is going to go nuts, and you’re going to see that in football too… They’re starting to do greater and greater stuff.”</span></p>
<p><span>He also hopes that the women at the core of this doc, who achieved incredible things in surfing against all odds and now live in relative obscurity – running surf clubs, training young surfers, driving school buses – will get the recognition they deserve. </span><span>“A lot of young girls don’t even realise how bad it was for those women and how much the world has changed,” adds Nelius. “They didn’t know their history because they had nothing to show it to them… These women are all sort of superheroes in hiding… Hopefully, people watching the film will see that now. That was the motivation behind wanting to make it.”</span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">MUNA on horniness, eggs, and Ronald Reagan</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">We chat to the trio following the release of their new self-titled album, in the latest episode of the dA-Zed guide to being...</h3>

<div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="msKIu5BtywA "><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/msKIu5BtywA " webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>H is for horny, according to Josette Maskin. “MUNA’s new record [...] says it’s OK to be horny,” she quips, in our new dA-Zed guide to being MUNA.</span></p>
<p><span>The group’s third, self-titled new record, is an indisputably sexy album: it opens with “Silk Chiffon”, a song brimming with sapphic yearning. Then comes “What I Want”, an anthem about hooking up with leather-clad girls and taking ecstasy in gay clubs. “We recently found out people fuck to our music because a few people told us,” guitarist and producer Naomi McPherson says – and really, that’s no surprise.</span></p>
<p><span>Created after </span><span>the trio had been dropped by their label and re-signed with Phoebe Bridgers’ Saddest Factory Records – and </span><span>released as the world began to emerge from the shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic – it’s also a celebration of fresh starts, new beginnings and growth. Even the word ‘muna’ is Finnish for egg. “Finnish people have been very, very diligent in letting us know that over the years,” according to McPherson.</span></p>
<p><span>The group take time for reflection on the album, too. The penultimate track, “Loose Garments”, is all about letting go of past pain. “It was like a weight that we needed to get off our shoulders,” singer-songwriter Katie Gavin shared in an </span><a href="/music/article/56265/1/muna-interview-new-album-2022-interview"><span>interview with Dazed</span></a><span> earlier this year. “Now, it’s like we’re just dancing around in the space that’s left after that.”</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Alex G doesn’t need to explain himself</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The elusive indie rock artist talks to James Greig about his new newfound faith, the return of guitar music, and his expansive new album, God Save The Animals</h3>

		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1330/0/1330032.jpg" alt="EPR4221 -Alex G - PC Chris Maggio - 300dpi (1)" />
	</figure>
<p><span>The DIY bedroom artist was one of the hallmarks of the 2010s; an almost mythical figure who embodied the radical, democratising potential of the internet. With a laptop and Bandcamp account, anyone could become a star – or, at least what passes for a star in the world of indie music. In recent years, a new generation of DIY artists, slicker and poppier than their predecessors, and helped along by TikTok and streaming platforms, have risen to build a billion-dollar industry. But few artists who rose to fame through the internet have been more influential, prolific and critically acclaimed as Alexander Giannascoli, whose ninth record </span><em><span>God Save the Animals</span></em><span> is released this month.</span></p>
<p>Under the moniker of <a href="/tag/alex-g">Alex G</a>, he <span>first launched his career in 2010 with a series of albums that he both recorded and released himself. After building up a following on Bandcamp, he gradually became a critical darling; the kind of artist guaranteed a Best New Music slot on <em>Pitchfork </em>and who a friend of mine recently described, with some degree of accuracy, as “the only man who makes good music”. Throughout Giannascoli’s career, he has racked up an impressive array of collaborations including <a href="/tag/porches">Porches</a>; Japanese Breakfast, <a href="/tag/frank-ocean">Frank Ocean</a> (he played guitar on “White Ferrari” and “Self-control”, two stand-out tracks from </span><em><span>Blonde</span></em><span>) and experimental producer <a href="/tag/oneohtrix-point-never">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>, with whom he released a brutally sad song called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ4F5-pEAzo">Babylon</a>” (which, the day after a breakup, I once listened to repeat for the full nine hours of an office shift.) </span></p>
<p><span>His music has been described as ‘lo-fi’, which suggests something scuzzy, stripped-back and straightforward. But from the very beginning, Alex G’s music has always been more interesting than that. Even his first ever album, </span><em><span>Race </span></em><span>(2010), is experimental and diverse in its production, balancing acoustic strumming alongside synth organs; eerie, pitch-shifted vocals, and other strange effects which I couldn’t name if I tried. From that point onwards, his sonic palette has become ever more lush and expansive, incorporating elements of folk, country and electronic music. </span><em><span>God Save the Animals</span></em><span>, is no exception, featuring auto-tuned vocals and flashes of hyperpop alongside lush piano arrangements and looped drum beats which almost veer into trip-hop. As well as being instrumentally varied, it captures a wide range of tones and moods, being alternatively frenetic, ecstatic, sombre and sultry. </span></p><p><span>Alex G, with whom I spoke on the phone last week, is simultaneously one of the nicest and most difficult people I’ve ever interviewed. Although he is extremely friendly, he is simply not very talkative. Almost every sentence either ends or begins with “I guess”; he qualifies his statements with “jeez, I don’t know” or “I don’t want to say anything dumb”; he trails off, leaving us in silences so extended I feel compelled to fill them with inane chatter. By the end, I started to feel guilty every time I asked him a fresh question, as though the process were a form of torture I was subjecting him to and which he was bearing with good grace. But ultimately it doesn’t matter: he’s already said what he needs to say in his music, which speaks for itself. If he’s not great at providing catchy soundbites, who cares? It’s not his job.</span></p>
<p><span>As the title suggests, <em>God Save the Animals</em> is suffused with references to religion and faith: the opening track, “After All”, begins, “<em>After all, people come and people stay/ yeah but God with me he stayed”</em>, and from there on the rest of the album is peppered with references to blessings, floods, prayer, sinners, miracles and crosses; it gestures towards themes of forgiveness and redemption. But this isn’t always as earnest as it might sound: at one point he deadpans, “<em>Jesus is my lawyer.</em>” </span></p>
<p><span>Giannascol’</span><span>s interest in faith is something which he only developed recently. “I guess I’m not sure why I was drawn to it,” he tells Dazed. “It just started to come up in my life more and more, so it was inevitably something I was thinking about. I guess it’s just another big question that everyone ends up asking themselves.” When some of his close friends recently became religious, he started to think more about what it means and what its value might be. “I guess the crux of it is believing in a higher power, but there’s more to it. I think what it does for yourself can be valuable, as opposed to just boiling it down to simply believing that God is in control of everything,” he says.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="JFaMCIVHz2I"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JFaMCIVHz2I" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Even if the thematic preoccupations of the album are clear, </span><span>Giannascoli </span><span>is never obvious or preachy. His lyrics, while often vivid, are typically opaque, and listening to </span><em><span>God Save the Animals </span></em><span>you’d be hard-pressed to discern a declarative statement about the meaning of religion. For Alex, ambiguity has its own kind of power. “I guess you could equate it to visual art, where on one hand there’s photography and realism, and then, on the other hand, there’s Impressionism and stuff like that,” he says. While he thinks that both approaches are valuable in their own right, he identifies with the latter far more. “I guess that’s where I’m at with it,” he says. “It’s just what I am interested in, it’s the type of art I’m drawn to so that’s what I end up making, I guess.” His lyrics might be ambiguous, but they’re also evocative, emotionally suggestive and sharply specific in their imagery. This makes the act of listening to his music – and creating the meaning for yourself – something like a collaborative act. </span></p>
<p><span>While making this album, </span><span>Giannascoli </span><span>drew on influences from mediums other than music. He originally studied English Literature at college, with the hope of becoming a teacher before dropping out to focus on music, and he still reads a lot today. When making his last record, 2019’s </span><em><span>House of Sugar</span></em><span>, he was reading a lot of Roberto Bolano (the Chilean novelist most famous for </span><em><span>2666,</span></em><span> a sprawling, epic set along the US-Mexico border), while his latest album is partly inspired by the work of Joy Williams, a novelist and short story writer whose work explores themes of purity, sin and spiritual and economic collapse in America. “It would be hard to say how exactly [these other mediums] play into my music, but they definitely do,” he says. “If you’re making something your brain is taking in all this stuff throughout the day, and then what feels like it just came from nowhere, it’s actually just your brain, scrambling up all the different stimuli that you acquired throughout the day.”</span></p>
<p><span>Throughout </span><span>Giannascoli</span><span>’s career, he has garnered comparison to Eliott Smith, the undisputed titan of melancholy songwriting who died by suicide in 2003. This makes sense up to a point; at times their music shares a certain laconic, aloof melancholy, and they are both excellent melodists. But it’s Alex G’s production – the way he combines acoustic instrumentation with electronic techniques like drum pads, synths and pitch-shifting – that elevates his music into vital and unmistakably contemporary music. His work might share an emotional resonance with someone like Elliott Smith or Jeff Buckley, but it’s also </span><em><span>interesting </span></em><span>in a way that it wouldn’t be if he was simply doing a retread. While he’s arguably a modern update of the “singer-songwriter” archetype, he doesn’t quite fit that mould. “I completely understand why I am considered a singer-songwriter and I have no problem with any of that,” he says. “It’s just when I'm thinking of myself making music, I think of myself more as a producer.”</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="PElHOpvqRK4"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PElHOpvqRK4" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>From his earliest days making music in his bedroom, he has always had a keen interest in utilising whatever technology he had at his disposal. “I think that's a big part of my music,” he says. “I guess the difference is that I have access to all this recording stuff and all this technology, whereas for Elliott Smith, and other singer-songwriters like him, their canvas was mostly limited to their instruments. But I can sit here with my laptop and mess around. It’s so easy for me to pitch-shift or do all this crazy stuff. The laptop is kind of like my instrument,” he says. This kind of experimentation is, above all, a way of keeping himself engaged with what he’s making. “The whole time I’m just trying to keep myself feeling something, and so if the melody isn’t doing it for me anymore, maybe I’ll mess with the pitch or add a harmony and sometimes I’ll end up liking it more after doing that,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span>Alongside his more esoteric influences, he was also listening to a lot of mainstream commercial pop music on the radio while making the album – something which is most apparent on “No Bitterness”, a song which starts out as a sombre acoustic ballad before exploding into a <a href="/tag/hyperpop">hyperpop</a> anthem which sounds like something approaching a <a href="/tag/100-gecs">100 Gecs</a> song. “I always listened to the radio a lot, and I’ve always tried to capture some of that stuff in my music,” he says. “But it always comes across differently. I have never been able to get it right, I guess because of the limited means I had. I didn't have the nice microphones and I hadn’t developed my craft – and I still haven’t, I'm still not there. But I guess I just liked that stuff, and I respect it.” </span></p>
<p><span>After years of being proclaimed irrelevant, guitar music has made a striking resurgence in recent years, with artists like <a href="/tag/phoebe-bridgers">Phoebe Bridgers</a> and <a href="/music/article/55830/1/sam-fender-profile-interview-seventeen-going-under-album-review-2022">Sam Fender</a> becoming wildly popular, even generation-defining. Alex G forms a part of this resurgence, even if he’s at the more experimental and inventive end of the spectrum. When I ask him why he thinks guitar music has made such a comeback, he says he hasn’t thought about it much. “I guess maybe it’s some kind of cycle where everyone is just referring back to the music they heard when they were kids,” he says. “With my generation, in the late 90s and early 2000s, there’s a lot of melancholy guitar stuff like Smashing Pumpkins, Elliott Smith, Wilco, Radiohead…” Is that the kind of music he liked himself as a teenager? “You caught me,” he says with a grin, “I was basically just listing off everything I listened to then. But yeah, I feel that’s what I’m always subconsciously referencing. I wonder if that’s why it’s coming back…oh, jeez, I don’t know.” </span></p>
<p><span>In the end, maybe </span><span>Giannascoli’s polite</span><span> refusal to go too deep, or unwillingness to expound on his own music – to stay restrained or platitudinous – doesn’t really matter very much. Maybe an album as great as <em>God Save the Animals</em> doesn’t need to be explained. </span></p>
<p><span>God Save The Animals <em>is out now</em></span></p>]]>

<p><span>The first ever fragrance I purchased for myself by Glow by JLo, bought with money given to me earlier that day by my step-grandmother. Britney Spears Fantasy, Vera Wang Princess and Gucci Rush followed over the next few years as I participated wholeheartedly in the age-old teen girl tradition of smelling like a candy shop.  </span></p>
<p><span>Like your first kiss, it’s hard to forget your first scent. Both occur during those heady, hormone-filled teenage years when everything is new and exciting and terrible. Today, a single whiff of the scents I used to wear will bring me straight back to that ghastly, nostalgic period of braces, crushes and angst. “We have so many big emotions at that age and we’re going through so much,” says Elizabeth Renstrom, a photographer and former senior photo editor for <em>The New Yorker</em>. “Perfume really marks that and I think that’s why we’re able to remember them so well. They’re associated with all these big firsts in our lives. It’s a special time and that’s why the perfume we wore then resonates so much now.” </span></p>
<p><span>It’s exactly these big emotions and firsts that Renstrom</span><span> taps into for her project </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/basenote_bitch/?hl=en"><span>Basenote Bitch</span></a><span>. A photography and review series, Basenote Bitch takes retro fragrances, particularly ones beloved by teens, and lovingly satirises them alongside still-life homages to the bedroom scenes that would have been home to the perfumes. Focusing on the 80s, 90s and early aughts, the images evoke powerful nostalgia for both those who lived through the years themselves, and the younger generation who long for the rose-tinted days of landlines, dELiA*s and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.</span></p>
<p>Dazed spoke to Renstrom about the project, nostalgia and her desperate search for the Emily the Strange fragrance.</p><p><strong>You call yourself an “unhinged frag head” which I love. When did your obsession start?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom:</strong><span> I think my obsession really began with having to do gym in school. I was so concerned about smelling disgusting because I would be too mortified to shower in front of people after gym class. So I was always rolling with like eight body sprays!</span></p>
<p><span>Then when I got my first job, that’s when I upgraded to the perfume counters at the mall. A specific perfume has always marked where I’ve been in my career and work life too. So it’s been a long journey. The collecting happened more recently, but I don’t wear a ton of fragrances that I use for the project. My personal collection of fragrances is a little bit separate.</span></p>
<p><strong>More sophisticated?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>Yeah! Although there are some that I still wear. I love Lolita Lempicka, their original fragrance is so good. And I love the Gap Dream. It is really amazing, the original formulation is really good. </span></p>
<p><strong>When did you decide to turn your collection into a project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>I started it right before the pandemic in February 2020. I was working on another project about how we market beauty products to women and I wanted to do an image about [Victoria’s Secret] Love Spell for that series. I shot it and I really liked it and I was like, ‘Oh, I have a couple more perfumes that I would like to reflect on in this way’. Like Sweet Pea from Bath and Body Works. </span></p>
<p><span>Then it just spiralled in the pandemic, it was such a therapeutic thing for me to revisit these things when I couldn't travel. And I was having so much fun recreating this time in my life. It’s an ongoing series for me and one that I will always contribute to as long as there are perfumes to write about. Fragrances didn’t come out as rapidly in that time period but there’s so much I haven’t explored that I would like to.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>Do you think as a society currently we are particularly susceptible to nostalgia?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>I think it’s easier for us to be, because of the internet. And I don’t want to give a cliché answer but I think that we are living in very uncertain times. Whenever I’m feeling uncertain about anything, I lean into the things that comforted me before and this project is a product of that. </span></p>
<p><span>So I think it’s a combination of uncertainty and also access to being able to revisit and recycle trends online. I do feel like it makes us regurgitate moments in beauty and fashion so much quicker than we would have even five years ago. I don't really see it as a problem but I am curious how we will reflect on our fashion and beauty five years from now. What were we doing that was different? Or was it all just a reflection on our past? I’m not sure.</span></p>
<p><strong>One of your reviews is for Love’s Baby Soft and the campaign for it at the time included a very young model and the slogan “Because innocence is sexier than you think.” You must learn a lot about the culture of the time period by looking at old advertising and the way things were marketed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>Yeah, when I look at that and think about how far we’ve come it gives me a little bit of comfort and hope. Love’s Baby Soft came out in the 70s and, at the time, I don’t think it was a controversial marketing scheme because it lasted for a while. Hopefully, we’re in a space where nothing like that would ever fly. But yes, you learn so much about advertising and who was in the room during that time where this could get made. </span></p>
<p><span>That’s also a big part of this project: gently, sometimes not gently in the case of that one, critiquing how these things come into our hands. Because even though they’re beloved, sometimes it’s super problematic how we were reeled into buying them. Marketing in beauty can be very predatory and I love talking about that in a lot of my reviews too. Because they are reflections, but they’re not always starry-eyed reflections. I’m not always like, ‘I loved that time period where I hated myself because I wasn’t Kate Moss’. I think it’s good to talk about how we talked about bodies every decade. And perfume is sort of like a medium for that.</span></p>
<p><strong>Perfume trends themselves also often reflect the cultural mood of the time they are from. In the future when we look back on today, what trends do you think will represent the decade?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong>I think the mid-2010s going into now we’ve been really into what I’d call personal fragrances, ones that are attuned to <a href="/beauty/article/41723/1/personalised-perfume-natural-scent">adjust to your personal scent or pheromones</a>. I think that’s something that people are really interested in. And the nude neutral fragrance vibe, not to be confused with unisex although I think that’s a really big continuing trend. But I think the ‘close to you’ personal fragrance is something people are really interested in and continue to be. I've definitely been swayed by the barely there fragrance.<br /></span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>I completely agree, like the Glossier You fragrance.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>And I love them but then I totally reject them half the time. I’m like, ‘No, I want everybody to smell me. I want to smell from 50 feet away’. That’s when I wear something like Marissa Zappas ‘Whore’. When I want to be perceived.</span></p>
<p><strong>I think one of the best compliments you can get is when someone says ‘you smell amazing, what perfume are you wearing?’</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>I’m always searching for that moment. It truly only happens when I’m wearing a couple of fragrances, I always get compliments on them. It’s either Orpheon from Diptyque or recently Gris Charnel from BDK Parfums, that’s a very big compliment getter.</span></p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that you wanted to keep going with the project – do you see it evolving?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>I think I will continue to make the reviews in the way that they're going but I would also love to bring it into a more physical space in some way. Whether that’s a book or an exhibition where people can really engage with the different fragrances that are part of the projects in a setting that also shows off the period-specific props. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>I’d love to conceptualise an experience for the followers and perfume enthusiasts to have a library of sorts to go through and engage with them in their own way. Maybe contribute their feelings. That is a dream of mine. I receive so many messages from my personal reviews of them, but it would be amazing for people to have their own experiences. There are olfactory art spaces in New York where I feel like that could be possible. That would be my total dream, to make something a little bit more collaborative.</span></p>
<p><strong>I’m going to manifest that for you! Are there any perfume trends at the moment that you're excited about?</strong><span></span></p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Remstrom: </strong><span>I want to manifest goth fairy fragrances coming back and having that be more of a genre. As <a href="/music/article/56815/1/amy-lee-tells-the-real-story-behind-evanescences-bring-me-to-life">Evanescence comes back</a> and <a href="/fashion/article/54603/1/wtf-is-indie-sleaze-comeback-tiktok-trend-y2k-chanel-saint-laurent-cobrasnake">Indie Sleaze</a> I’d love to see how that influences fragrance. This is not a trend, it’s just me being like ‘I want this trend’. I want more goth fairy fragrances. I want Avril Lavigne to come out with a new fragrance because she hasn’t in a long time. It’s been hard for me to find a fragrance that encapsulates the goth girl from the 2000s. The kind who had an Emily the Strange poster. There is an Emily the Strange perfume but it is so expensive. On eBay, it’s like $500. I need to do a callout to see if anybody owns it and can ship it to me to be photographed!</span></p>
<p><span>I really hope that people just continue to engage with and be interested in fragrance. Fragrance, in general, has had a big moment the past couple of years in terms of people wanting to wear and explore them, so I really want to see that continue. And I want people to be excited about trying new fragrances because there are so many cool indie fragrance brands. I want people to find their personal scent and get excited about it. And overspray!</span><span></span></p>]]>

<p><span>Terrence Zhou, a young designer from Wuhan in China, would henceforth like to be known as a “bad binch”. It’s a point that becomes apparent when he selects his debut fashion show – which just took place in New York – as the most remarkable collection in the entire history of fashion. “In my world, there is only me and no others,” he tells us. Needless to say, if he was to wear one designer for the rest of his life, it would be </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bad_binch_tongtong/?hl=en"><span>Bad Binch TONGTONG</span></a><span>, his own brand. And, when describing the genesis behind his SS23 collection, he is quick to note a singular source of inspiration: himself. </span></p>
<p><span>Having moved to the US at the tender age of 17 to study mathematics and engineering, Zhou soon transferred to </span><a href="/tag/parsons"><span>Parsons School of Art and Design</span></a><span>, where he built a design studio based on the tenets of “hilarity and farce”. There, condom dresses consume the body in spherical sculptures, tentacles, and siren tails, while models bob up and down in hooped columns like kitsch dashboard ornaments. Taking himself away from the slam of <a href="/tag/nyfw">New York Fashion Week</a>, Zhou showcased his first official collection off-schedule at the Richard Taittinger Gallery, blending the URL and IRL in a series of interactive installations. Staged in collaboration with Cider, three rooms were dedicated to his designs – referred to as the Sea Witch, the Queen of Bugs, and Mrs Geometry. </span></p><p><span>Models were transformed into enormous fluoro butterflies, velveteen mermaids, rubber ring arachnids, centipedes, and gargantuan, conjoined cells – an idea perhaps taken from late nights spent “watching videos explaining the science of the universe.” The whole thing is meant to “control the viewer by offering an expression of unapologetic beauty through exaggerated forms,” he says. “For me, this collection is an autobiographical experience, and it is now an archive that documents the most vulnerable, hilarious, and personal moments of my life, allowing for both a metaphorical and literal embodiment of self and how people appear in society.” Those kinds of fascinations were further articulated by choreographer Stefanie Nelson, who took Zhou’s absurd shapes way beyond the body in a carousel of languid routines. </span></p>
<p><span>“Bad Binches are kids, adults, and people of all different genders and body types,” the designer says, with wheelchair users and children zooming through the showspace. Though his own wardrobe rarely stretches beyond tank tops and shorts – “</span><span>I usually buy the same style and same colour, so I don’t have to spend time thinking about what I should wear for that day” – Zhou’s practice calls on his scientific background, and non-conventional models, to prod at the limits of what is considered clothing, lauding the fantastical over anything remotely wearable. “I never think of fashion as having too much power, it’s a medium or a tool,” he concludes. “It’s not about projecting a feeling onto others, but creating something that feels authentic, and enables people to express themselves.” </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>Every image tells a story. From culture to costume, dress codes to hairstyles and the nationalism we brush off as normal, symbols of shared heritage hold the power to shape the way we interpret ourselves. They tell stories of conquest and subjugation, power and resistance. When re-evaluated, they allow us to critically confront the past and our struggles for social justice, whether it’s destigmatising afro hair in professional spaces via UK campaign group the Halo Collective, or artist Hew Locke’s unpacking of Britain’s problematic past through thought-provoking portraiture. In our digital-first, image-obsessed present, it seems there are reclamations of heritage happening everywhere, every day, and at a faster and more frantic pace than ever. Symbols that were previously used to wield power over people are rehashed to assert some semblance of control over the present – and nowhere is this more prevalent than on an extremely grassroots level. Here, we head to Bolivia, Jamaica and Turkey, where local groups are reclaiming their histories in groundbreaking ways, taking matters into their own hands both online and off.</span></p><h1>IMILLASKATE, BOLIVIA</h1>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>It’s a warm evening in Cochabamba, the third largest city in Bolivia. ImillaSkate collective are skating downhill on a road lined with large trees. The crew of nine girls, all in their 20s, wear voluminous, knee-length polleras dresses and bowler hats – traditional outfits associated with the formerly marginalised indigenous women, or cholitas. Their hair is long and neatly braided into two plaits. It’s a part of their local identity, a way to stay connected to their ancestors.</span></p>
<p><span>For ImillaSkate, wearing polleras is a way to reclaim their heritage and call out the persecution that Aymara and Quechua people have long faced in a country where more than half of the population has indigenous roots. Originating from the Spanish conquest, the garment was initially imposed onto locals. But it has since become a part of their cultural heritage. “As a group, we use the pollera to send a message of inclusion and empowerment – and to vindicate the women who wear them in our environment,” says María Belén Fajardo Fernández, one of the members of ImillaSkate. Many of the group’s polleras have been passed down over generations, so wearing them is a way to reclaim traditional codes and reappraise the country’s colonial past. “For me, there is great sentimental value, because I inherited my skirt from my grandmother,” Fernández adds. “Wearing it gives me strength.”</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><span>Founded in 2019 by Daniela Santiváñez, 26, and two friends, the crew takes its name from the word <em>imilla</em>, meaning ‘young girl’ in Aymara and Quechua, the two most widely spoken languages in Bolivia outside of Spanish. They practise every week, spending long hours skating in Ollantay Park, one of two places in the city with ramps. As one of the few all-women skating crews in the country – the sport has only been around in Bolivia for two decades – skateboards are a vehicle for positive change, a way to break down the barriers that have held women back for generations. “It has helped me to lose fear and keep persevering,” Belén explains. “Concentrating on a trick gives you the motivation to keep trying to break the mould. The flow of the ramp feels like riding a wave.”</span><span></span><span></span></p>

<p><span>In Turkey, artists and activists in Istanbul’s predominantly queer and trans neighbourhood Şişli are rejecting the symbolism associated with the country’s imperial Ottoman past as a way of resisting its authoritarian and anti-LGBTQ+ regime. “I had to heal from the trauma associated with [imperial] iconography,” says Kiki Cicinash, a queer activist and legend in the city’s drag scene. “The artists and brands who see it as simply ethnic patterns don’t grasp its weight. To be subjected to it is a whole different feeling.”</span></p>
<p><span>Under President Erdoğan’s regime, queer people are often subjected to violent police clampdowns. Istanbul Pride, previously the largest Pride parade in eastern Europe, has been banned for seven years, while the Istanbul Convention that legally protected the rights of women and LGBTQ+ people in Turkey was dropped last year. “We have been subjected to violence by the police even in small gatherings, so everyone is traumatised,” says Cicinash. “We face the risk of prosecution not only for our actions on the streets but also when we criticise the government on social media.”</span></p>
<p><span>Amid an atmosphere of rising hate crimes and fearmongering, Ottoman imagery carries oppressive undertones for Şişli’s fearlessly queer community. They don’t want to be associated with the codes of a country that denies their existence. Many of the community’s members come from Muslim backgrounds. Some of them have been ostracised from their families but, in Şişli, they live with chosen families in shared, queer households. They throw raucous events and dress in loud, alienoid forms. “Being silent and invisible is not a choice to go with for some of us, nor is it what we want,” explains Cicinash, whose riotous live shows merge grotesque visuals with horror-infused dance routines and lip-syncs. “Our rebellion begins with our existence and continues with setting our foot outside, going to the market, putting on make-up and being on the stage. As we live, they go mad! This is an important and dangerous rebellion.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“Our rebellion begins with our existence, and continues with setting our foot outside, putting on make-up and being on the stage” – Kiki Cicinash</span><span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>But the pressures to conform to an orientalist aesthetic are not limited to internal attitudes. “As an artist coming from a Middle Eastern background, I have always felt the pressure to demonstrate authenticity to the west-driven media and art world, where we’re only interesting if we play into archaic roles and aesthetics,” says Elz, a musician and performer. They recently relocated from Şişli to London. “I completely reject any orientalism that caters to these pre-existing notions and games of profit over that.”</span></p>
<p><span>The Istanbul-born artist, who performs under their alias Sissy Misfit, instead takes inspiration from the city’s goth scene and the New York club-kid aesthetic. Their recent mixtape, <em>Hell Music for Şişli Girls</em>, takes traditional Turkish pop and folk songs and transforms them into ear-splitting hardcore anthems, cranked up to a lethal 200BPM. “I am just a performer who loves creating maximal art and noise who also happened to be born in Turkey,” they say. “I refuse to apply the formulas of aesthetic history built around my body and it makes me angry and sad to see many using this iconography as ethnic quirks to this day.”</span></p>

<p><span>Symbols are not always as obvious as iconography. In Jamaica, activists are fighting against racist beauty standards left behind by colonial rule. “Outward expressions of Black identity are frequently met with extraordinarily conservative and prejudicial attitudes in many quarters, helping to reinforce colonial narratives and a stratification of society along lines of class and colour,” says Keenan Falconer, youth advisor to the Jamaican government.</span></p>
<p><span>As one of the biggest signifiers of race, hair is both an important symbol in shaping an individual’s identity and in understanding the systematic oppression left over from British colonial rule. Jamaica’s population is 90 per cent Black, yet discussions about hair are still steeped in anti-Black rhetoric. In 2020, Jamaica’s Supreme Court ruled in favour of a school’s decision to demand that a seven-year-old student cut her dreadlocks to attend classes – a decision that sparked national outrage. “No child should be denied or threatened with denial of an education because they wear locks,” said human rights group Jamaicans for Justice in a statement at the time. “Many children and families across Jamaica have been negatively impacted by this and other unjust rules that police children’s appearance in unreasonable and discriminatory ways.” But, two years on, the ruling has not been overturned.</span></p>
<p><span>“Secondary schools have been unrelenting in their overzealous enforcement of obsolescent rules regarding the grooming of Black hair, sometimes leading to exclusion from the participation in learning activities until the matter is rectified according to the school’s colonially ingrained standards,” explains Falconer. But he maintains that this has only furthered young Jamaicans’ collective efforts to resist the policing of Black hair, as well as colonial attitudes, more generally.</span></p>

<p><span>When Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge visited the Caribbean back in March, activists were quick to protest, with demonstrators gathering in front of the British High Commission in Kingston, calling to “trample Babylon” and demanding reparations for slavery and colonisation. Uncomfortable visuals of Kate holding hands with children through a chain-link fence only furthered the visit’s colonial overtones. Jamaican politician Lisa Hanna, whose dancehall-infused election video went viral in 2020, was accused by the British press of snubbing the Duchess of Cambridge on her visit to Jamaica earlier this year. She responded in an essay for The Guardian emphasising the need for reparations in the Caribbean community (Caricom), given Britain’s history of wars, slavery and subjugation.</span></p>
<p><span>“The response was hardly surprising,” says Falconer. “The trip was intended to shore up support for the monarchy in the Caribbean, but it ricocheted spectacularly with the announcement by the prime minister that Jamaica will begin the constitutional process of decoupling, which is only appropriate in the 60th year of the country’s political independence.” The visit, says Falconer, also reignited the collective need for reparatory justice. “This is long overdue and necessary as the country aims to take a significant step in its constitutional advancement. This bodes well for the promotion and reaffirmation of Black identity in a country where this racial group forms the overwhelming majority.”</span><span><br /></span></p><p><span>Symbols are not always as obvious as iconography.

<p><span>Last week, Jay-Z made an honest effort to convince us that terms and slogans like “capitalist” and “eat the rich” were </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/jay-z-capitalist-new-slur-wealth-us-b2158116.html"><span>derogatory</span></a><span> and invented to bring down the Black community. But the truth of the matter is billionaires are evil. They are not only a sign of economic failure, but they’re also extremely bad for the </span><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/environment/worlds-richest-people-carbon-footprint/"><span>environment</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The billionaire owner of the outdoor clothing company Patagonia, Yvon Chouinard, knows this. He announced yesterday (September 14) that he is giving his entire company away to fight against climate change. </span></p>
<p><span>Patagonia, which was founded in 1973, is known for its dedication to environmentalism and community care. In 1984, the brand opened an on-site cafeteria offering nutritional vegetarian food and provided on-site child care. In 1986, Chouinard announced that the company would be committing ten per cent of profits to environmental activism. This commitment included paying people to work on ecological projects so they could commit to their projects full time. In 2002, Chouinard founded the </span><a href="https://onepercentfortheplanet.org/"><span>1 per cent for the Planet</span></a><span>, and Patagonia became the first enterprise to dedicate one per cent of annual sales to the environment.</span></p>
<p><span>In an </span><a href="https://eu.patagonia.com/gb/en/home/"><span>open letter</span></a><span> to customers, Chouinard wrote, “Despite its immensity, the Earth’s resources are not infinite, and it’s clear we’ve exceeded its limits. So instead of extracting value from nature and transforming it into wealth, we are using the wealth Patagonia creates to protect the source.” The Chouinard family will transfer all ownership to two new entities, The Patagonia Purpose Trust and the Holdfast Collective. Through the Patagonia Trust, Chouinard will only own two per cent of its total stock. Patagonia will donate </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62906853"><span>£87 million annually</span></a><span> to environmental causes depending on the company’s health.</span></p>
<p><span>Even though philanthropy (which primarily benefits the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/08/how-philanthropy-benefits-the-super-rich"><span>super rich</span></a><span>) should be met with suspicion, Chouinard’s efforts past and present appear genuine. As we head into “</span><a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/09/1126511"><span>uncharted territory”</span></a><span> with the climate crisis, we need all the help we can get to reverse climate change. </span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

OK, it’s more nuanced than that, but we’re closed today to celebrate this new plan to save our one and only home.

<p><span>The <a href="/tag/ss23">SS23 fashion season</a> kicked off in <a href="/fashion/article/56926/1/new-york-ss23-women-arca-fendi-linda-evangelista-kendall-jenner-marc-jacobs">New York</a> last Friday, bringing with it big back-to-school vibes. Summer isn’t over in the big city though, where temperatures both on and off the catwalk were soaring and the beauty was just as hot. Supersized hair was seen at <a href="/fashion/gallery/31293/0/collina-strada-ss23-womenswear">Collina Strada</a> and <a href="/fashion/gallery/31292/0/no-sesso-ss23-womenswear">No Sesso</a> with extreme braids and sculptural hairstyles that reached up to the heavens, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span>Models at <a href="/fashion/gallery/31296/0/puppets-and-puppets-ss23-womenswear">Puppets and Puppets</a> were covered in everyone’s favourite pimple patches Starface, while the looks at <a href="/fashion/gallery/31295/0/luar-ss23-womenswear">Raul Lopez’s Luar</a> were inspired by his aunts’ over-the-top beauty at family reunions – think classic updos, black lips and feathers to add some extra drama.</span></p>
<p><span>At Barragán, the provocative looks included massive fake filler lips, “meth teeth”, mullets and Karen wigs. Presented amidst a music festival from hell, the show was a social commentary on the state of America, its “business as usual” culture and whiteness. </span></p>
<p><span>Here are the boldest beauty moments from NYFW SS23.</span><span></span></p><h2><span>COLLINA STRADA</span></h2>	<figure>

Spiked-hair, sliced threads, and sweat-slicked skin: No Sesso took a dark turn for SS23, abandoning all of its home-spun, patchworked clubwear for leather LBDs and bodysuits that revealed slithers of torso, thigh, and breasts. Set in the bowels of The Shed, pendulous hoop earrings and black talon nails set the tone for what Pia Davis and Autumn Randolph referred to as “sexy summer”. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Hatnim Lee</span>		</figcaption>

Opening with a completely sheer dress sliced at the sternum, g-strings were worn over cycling shorts, bulwark-shouldered blazers were cropped at the navel, and ruched party dresses snaked from hip to neck in swooping cut-outs. A streetwise vixen, the No Sesso muse was wrapped up in a host of utilitarian details: asymmetric pockets, one-legged nylon trousers, and tendrilous drawstrings that begged to be pulled at. The whole thing huffed with extreme desire – cinched waists, pleaser heels, and miniscule bustiers that had been deliberately tugged low to display the areolas. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Hatnim Lee</span>		</figcaption>

But with all the sculptured extensions and wispy mallen streaks, there was a sense of clownishness to Davis and Randolph’s vision. Paperbag pants had been pulled right up to the ribs, as were some shapeless leather skirts, while biker jackets and t-shirts were cropped at the elbow as if to bind the arms against the body. Though sex may have been its calling card, it was often manic and OTT in its translation – literally demanding to be eyed. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Hatnim Lee</span>		</figcaption>

<p><span>The beauty highlight of NYFW was <a href="/fashion/gallery/31292/0/no-sesso-ss23-womenswear">No Sesso,</a></span><span> where both hair and nails were given an extreme makeover. Thanks to hairstylists Malcolm Marquez and <a href="/beauty/article/56028/1/hairstylist-fitch-lunar-s-creations-are-sexily-imperfect">Fitch Lunar</a>, hair was sculptural and experimental, often defying gravity by reaching up into the heavens from all different angles. For make-up there were lips lined in black kohl, metallic silvery eyeshadow applied to the inner corners with a black outline and dramatic pink blush thanks to make-up artist Sinn Apsara.</span></p>
<p><span>On nails was Yukie Miyakawa and assistant Miku Tsutaya who created XXL manicures in metallic silver and glossy black. Some sets were blunt while others curled over, at least as long as the models’ fingers. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

Make-up artist Fara Homidi applied a thick layer of glaze to the model's faces so they were glistening like doughnuts in the sun. Otherwise, make-up for the models, who included Caroline Polachek and Paloma Elsesser, was kept minimal with the occasional subtle mauve accent, while Tamara McNaughton on hair created what she described as hyper natural mullet cuts and otherworldly long hair. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>This season </span><a href="/fashion/gallery/31296/0/puppets-and-puppets-ss23-womenswear"><span>Puppets and Puppets</span></a><span> sent a collection down the catwalk that was inspired by Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick’s <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>. Accompanying the looks was make-up by Fara Homidi, once again, who created bold and glittering two-toned eye looks and dewy skin accessorised with butterflies below the eyes or, in the case of Caroline Polachek, across her chest.</span></p>
<p><span>Some models also walked the runway with black stickers in the shape of stars – familiar to anyone who has ever used a Starface pimple patch, which made its fashion week debut. While some had the stars dotted sparingly around their faces, others were absolutely loaded up, with arms covered in them elbow to fingertips. On hair, Blake Erik kept things natural so as not to overload the looks.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>At Dion Lee, <a href="/beauty/tag/isamaya-ffrench">Isamaya Ffrench</a> used her newly launched make-up brand to create a two-toned chameleon look. Taking the shades “Belt” and “Machine” from her Industrial palette, Ffrench used an airbrush to apply the shadows over mesh for a fish-scale-inspired effect. If you want to create the look yourself, check out our tutorial with Ffrench <a href="/beauty/article/46780/1/pro-tutorial-isamaya-ffrench-make-up-artist-video-series">here</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Keeping the focus on the make-up, hair by Mustafa Yanaz was natural, while nails by <a href="/beauty/article/42448/1/nailsbyjuan-nail-art">Juan Alvear</a> were short and glossy with a simple black line down the centre.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<h2>BARRAGÁN</h2>	<figure>

<p><a href="/tag/yadim"><span>Yadim</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/tag/evanie-frausto"><span>Evanie Frausto</span></a><span> (third time lucky!) teamed up at Barragán for the beauty which skirted controversy with massive fake filler lips, “meth teeth”, mullets and Karen wigs. A social commentary on the state of America and its culture of “business as usual” even amidst disaster and collapse, the show was presented on a set littered with rubbish, fake money and graffiti. </span></p>
<p><span>Blonde bobs with highlighted side fringes and spiky at the back looked like they were taken straight off the head of Kate Gosselin, while mullets, bleached blonde extensions and gelled twists made clear what designer Victor Barragán thinks of a certain type of whiteness. Meanwhile, Yadim gave models botched fake lips, teeth that were mostly fallen out, bad tan jobs and dirt-covered faces</span>.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">
		<h2>Barrag#225;n SS23 womenswear</h2>

With guests huddled behind metal barricades, models emerged from a graffitied portaloo in the West Village, wading through a runway strewn with dollar bills, plastic bottles, and cardboard. It was the 21st anniversary of 9/11 and Victor Barrag#225;n’s post-pandemic return looked to the American notion of “business as usual”, which the Latin American designer believes is enmeshed with all the reserve of whiteness – a point he articulated with an all-white cast of models. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Hatnim Lee</span>		</figcaption>

Heavy-handed in its takedown of capitalism, Barrag#225;n showed businessman ties, shirting, hunting camo, stars and stripes, and old briefcases, while certain models had been rolled-up in strips of laminated cash a la Kim Kardashian at Balenciaga. All-American wardrobe staples had been frankensteined with subversive cuts and mash-up mutations: there were hybrid bombers and tailored jackets, one-shouldered polo shirts, and belted cargo pants unzipped to reveal spangled budgie smugglers. Elsewhere, irreverent twists on corporate branding bore the words “homophobia”, “white tears”, and “cancelled twice”, while a “J’adore your hole” hoodie was a witty take on all the J’adore Dior baby tees which tend to proliferate queer clubs. 			<span class="fl-credit"></span>		</figcaption>

Camo biker shorts, “Meth” football jerseys, mullets, and Karen wigs were an obvious ploy on the tropes of white trash – reproduced through a queer immigrant’s gaze in bulge-baring, bicep-wiedling silhouttes, and empty slogans. The US class system may be less stringent than the UK’s, but Barrag#225;n’s vision of an all-commodified America proved symptomatic of the downward spiral of its most dominant groups, recontextualised in garish, bastardised fashion staples.			<span class="fl-credit"></span>		</figcaption>

<h2>TOM FORD</h2>
<p>Closing out New York was Tom Ford was the hair was big, big, big. Courtesy of <a href="/tag/jawara">Jawara</a>, the hair was teased into voluminous, sex curls which perfectly complemented all the sequins and disco cowgirl at Studio 54 vibe of the collection. One of the models was given an incredible braided headpiece that stole the show.</p>
<p>On make-up Yadim popped up again, creating smudgy, smokey eyes adding a rocker edge. Lips were kept neutral, the the skin fell just on the sweaty side of dewy – the result of nights spent dancing away at the disco maybe.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>Logging on to the internet to scope out the perfect pair of jeans can be an unnerving experience. From high street to high-end, bootcut to boyish, and indigo to that perfect, lived-in stonewash, the options are endless and expansive – but, of course, not all denim is created equal. Rising out of <a href="/new-york">New York</a> in 2011 came disruptive denim label <a href="https://3x1denim.com">3x1 NYC</a> – or ‘three by one’ if you’re saying it out loud. </span></p>
<p><span>Founded by designer Scott Morrison, 3x1 NYC is all about getting people to think differently about denim, and celebrating the versatility of the world’s most widespread material. Through unparalleled craftsmanship, a commitment to sustainability, and a vast line-up of authentic (and fashion forward) fits, the brand is now stocked globally, with all styles handmade in Milan. Needless to say it’s come a long way from its OG roots in a little enclave of NY’s SoHo district – though the values at its heart remain steadfast. </span></p><p><span>Now, as summer comes to an end and the biting chill of autumn closes in, 3x1 NYC is getting set to release its <a href="/aw22">AW22</a> offering. Core styles that have found fans in the likes of <a href="/Kendall-jenner">Kendall Jenner</a> and <a href="/Bella-hadid">Bella</a> and <a href="/gigi-hadid">Gigi Hadid</a> are reworked for the new season. Signature styles like the label’s classic Diana and Maya silhouette are updated for greater comfort and fit through new, innovative fabrications, while the Tom Boy is introduced with a ready-rolled hem (ideal for showing off the autumn’s hottest shoes). </span></p>
<p><span>At the more directional end of the scale, there’s also a nod to the cargo pant trend that’s currently taking over social media and street style shots alike, as the Sabina cargo lands a new iteration for the coming months. And for those who like to keep things baggy, without the bulk that pockets can add, there’s the wide-legged Helix Flip jean, with its striking stitched detailing and relaxed silhouette. </span></p><p><span>Don’t think 3x1 NYC’s AW22 offering stops at denim, though. The collection is rounded off with a small but perfectly formed edit of ready-to-wear looks in the form of the cosy Unusual fleece, which is crafted from a techy and uber-sturdy material called matelassé, the oversized, utilitarian Stefy shirt, and the Rosie vest, which channels denim’s rebellious spirit and countercultural roots through its boxy silhouette and cut-off sleeves. There’s also glossy, buttery leather, too, as seen across inky-black slim-fit trousers and slit-to-the-thigh pencil skirts for those after something a little more vampy. </span></p>
<p><span>With the fashion industry increasingly under fire for its detrimental impact on the planet, 3x1 NYC AW22 also doubles down on its commitment to becoming a more sustainable business. From meticulous hand-dying, to its use of recycled and repurposed denim and fibres, to its pioneering collaboration with future-facing Milanese mill Candiani, the label is intent on creating a more circular economy within the world of denim. “We constantly scout for the best denim canvases and washings, purposefully designing our garments to make them comfortable, stylish, resistant,” </span><span>says 3x1 NYC CEO Juan Piani. “We</span><span> handmake all our products in Milan to make sure that our clients have the best denim to support them with their lives.”</span></p>

<p><span><em>A sheet of blue light slices through the cavernous interior of Berlin’s </em><a href="/tag/berghain"><em>Halle am Berghain</em></a><em>. A handful of visitors move around spellbound, their faces illuminated in blue. Ducking beneath the pristine plane of light, disembodied legs appear to wander in the smoky dust of the world beneath. The ambient noise moves to a crescendo and you follow a series of thrilling, fast-moving spotlights to a cinema screen beyond… </em></span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Imagine a future in which the internet could be enmeshed with our nervous systems, allowing us symbiosis with technology capable of living our lives more flawlessly than we, as imperfect humans, ever could. </span><span>Set in “a great anomic era”, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/eyecheng/"><span>Ian Cheng</span></a><span>’s </span><a href="https://lightartspace.org/programme/life-after-bob-the-chalice-study"><em><span>Life After BOB</span></em></a><span> </span><span>invites us to envision a time in which AI cohabits our consciousness, exploring the perils and potential of artificial intelligence, mental health and existential fitness in the future century. The immersive exhibition is built around the first episode of the artist’s latest real-time narrative animation, allowing visitors an experience the atmosphere of the film while also interacting with potential-enhancing NFT-generating technology. </span></p><p><span>Episode one, </span><em><span>The Chalice Study</span></em><span>, tells the story of Chalice, a ten-year-old child who was implanted with an experimental AI named BOB (“Bag of Beliefs”) at birth by her neural engineer father, Dr Wong. “It’s a world where people get this implant like a neural link and, suddenly, you could experience a flow of data in and out of your brain and nervous system directly,” Cheng tells Dazed. “BOB can appear in Chalice’s head, like a dream or an inner voice. And Chalice can play these inner video games, while BOB is doing what we call ‘droning’ her physical body… doing tedious things for her in her life like dealing with conflict with her dad, walking up a flight of stairs that she’s too lazy to walk up. So she can just escape and check out.”</span></p>
<p><span>Cheng – who first studied cognitive science before becoming an artist – created this complex, beautiful film using the Unity game engine which is an unprecedented feat. “Nobody has produced a film of this kind before, using Unity to produce the building blocks for an entire cinematic universe,” explains Amira Gad, Head of Programmes at </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lightartspace/"><span>LAS</span></a><span>  (co-commissioner of<em> Life After BOB: The Chalice Study</em></span><span>) and curator of the exhibition. Screened live in real-time in the exhibition, the film uses a specially conceived algorithm to generate and randomise details of the onscreen world, conflicted feelings about technology, and whether he anticipates a future dystopia or utopia. </span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>I wonder if you could maybe begin by just introducing with, in your own words, the world in which the story takes place? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng: </strong><span>It started with the idea, ‘What if we were in a world where the internet goes to your nervous system?’ I could share my dreams with you, or maybe half a dream, a sensation of my finger, some fragment of a thing from my memory. I could share them with you and you could share them back, it could be this kind of telepathic dream language. So started from this crazy premise, in terms of the world, and then that became fertile enough for me to situate all the characters and imagine father-daughter scenes, but set in this new world in a much more tricky way. </span></p>
<p><strong>I love the way you allow the possibilities and perils of this technology to play out in the story. Could you tell us what you feel is the purpose and the value of storytelling? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng: </strong><span>So much of what we experience in terms of ingesting information or news or just understanding the world is non-narrative, it’s just talking to the conscious part – the left side – of your brain. I think our attraction to storytelling is its ability to allow us to become unconscious. Watching Netflix or at the theatre, it’s so joyful to become unconscious for a moment, because it bypasses the conscious part of your brain and suddenly you’re able to accept and dream about really complex stuff and it’s easier to digest. </span></p>
<p><span>You can tell a story about something complex and you can actually argue it out. When you have to write factually about something complex, you almost have to have made up your mind about it already, or feel like you understand it before you can start writing. The characters help get you there, the way a dream kind of helps get you somewhere. And so I think this is a very important form of technology that we’ve cognitively developed. Moviemaking and storytelling are more a kind of mediation of your dream world and trying to actually make it coherent. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“What if we were in a world where the internet goes to your nervous system?” – Ian Cheng</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>I found the experience of the exhibition was so much like a dream. In your introduction to the film, you invoked the idea of Disney World as an inspiration when you were thinking about how to present the screening in an exhibition context. Could you tell us more about that? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng: </strong><span>So many of the movies I loved growing up – things like </span><a href="/tag/studio-ghibli"><em><span>Spirited Away</span></em></a><span>, you watch it and it’s a coming of age story but the world it’s set in also seems like a great place you’d just like to hang out in. I wish someone would </span><a href="/film-tv/article/55348/1/look-studio-ghibli-theme-park-aichi-hayao-miyazaki-totoro-spirited-away"><span>create a theme park</span></a><span> of it. </span></p>
<p><span>I was so struck by that movie because I wanted to revisit it for all those details that are non-dramatic. I saw it again recently with my daughter and there’s a gang of little fat ducks having a bath you only notice maybe the fifth time watching it, but you can track them across the film and they are doing something coherent. It’s so beautiful to discover this detail. </span></p>
<p><span>I think there’s so much potential now for a story to really unfold the world and not just use it as a background or scaffolding. There are probably people in the audience who want to explore that, like me. And it’s a different temporality, it’s not so dramatic. It's not so adrenaline filled, you don’t feel the stakes are very high. And I think that activates a different part of you that’s happy to watch ducks having a bath but find it really thrilling.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>Without wishing to sound too essentialist, to what extent do you feel the world you have created is dystopian or utopian?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng: </strong><span>Writing a story about the future of AI, naturally, my mind when it’s in storytelling mode wants to argue both sides. So you create a character that is overly interested in AI, like Dr Wong. He wants an instrumental reason for AI – it’s going to help you with your future, it’s going to parent you. Then you have Zee who’s into it for all these tangential possibilities. </span></p>
<p><span>So I had to argue these different positions about AI and create dramatic tension. And so, naturally, you’re forced to argue all sides of a very complex topic. I don’t know how articulately I did it or how persuasively by a new in writing, I had to touch on every single point of view that I could imagine about AI. Who wins? I’m curious to know your response. </span></p>
<p><strong>I went in with more of a dystopian outlook but now, after having been to the exhibition, the whole issue of AI feels more complicated than before. To what extent do you think your work might be prophetic?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng: </strong><span>I think it might be too arrogant to say that it’s prophetic. Maybe the most hopeful outcome as an artist I would have is the reaction you had, where it becomes greyer. I haven’t necessarily changed your mind with this film, but maybe I’ve shifted you and you’re less certain in your original belief. As an artist, I couldn’t hope for more. </span></p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>For people like myself who are slightly unfamiliar with the technology you use, I wonder if you could explain why it’s pioneering to use Unity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng:</strong><span> Unity is used for building mobile app games or video games. Angry Birds is a super popular game built in Unity. </span><span>It’s unusual to use Unity to try to make narrative films. Before this, I think the longest Unity film has been like 10 minutes. And so it was a huge challenge for us to try to do something like this. </span></p>
<p><strong>Despite being a pioneer in this field and doing something relatively new, I wondered if there are any particular artists you look to for inspiration? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ian Cheng:</strong><span> I used to work for a French artist called Pierre Huyghe, I loved his work. Like, he’ll create an aquarium with species that really don't belong with each other in the same ecosystem, yet somehow he’ll make it work. Or an entire ecosystem for a huge park. I was so struck by this ethic of allowing things to be entropic and chaotic. His sculptures get overrun with grass or weeds. He had a sense of aliveness in his work and I wanted so much to achieve a sense of that too, but through visual means. </span></p>
<p><span>So much art is very static… painting and sculpture. As an artist, it tends to make you become a perfectionist because you’re moving toward a very fixed thing. </span><span>I’d prefer to approach it more like a gardener, tending to something and maybe it's not perfect. For me, this is a very liberating way to work, it stopped the perfectionist in me and activated a kind of parenting instinct. And I suppose that’s why Unity really lends itself to that process and being able to dive in there and change things. It’s like movie-making becomes a form of software with new updates released all the time. I love the idea that software is an evolving object. It can become kind of endless for me, yes. But the trade-off is that you can make really alive work.</span></p>

<p><span>The internet has spawned no shortage of contemporary cryptids – haunting, hidden beings shrouded in folklore, from </span><a href="/tag/slender-man"><span>Slender Man</span></a><span>, to </span><a href="/film-tv/article/45248/1/film-about-creepy-viral-hoax-momo-in-the-works"><span>Momo</span></a><span>, to the mysterious “entities” that stalk the murky yellow corridors of the </span><a href="/science-tech/article/52477/1/inside-the-uncanny-world-of-liminal-spaces-tiktok-reddit-nostalgia"><span>Backrooms</span></a><span>. These are all characters or creatures that have been dreamt up in the imaginations of human beings, before taking on a life of their own online, spread via forum posts, arcane video essays, and esoteric memes. Their origins aren’t easy to trace at the best of times, but what if the human element was removed altogether?</span></p>
<p><span>Last week, the Sweden-based musician and artist </span><a href="https://twitter.com/supercomposite"><span>Supercomposite</span></a><span> claimed to have stumbled across one of these beings, while messing around with an AI image-generating software (which, for various reasons, she refuses to disclose) back in April. </span><span>“</span><span>Originally it was a project of exploration,” she says. </span><span>What she didn’t expect to find was a recurring image of</span><span> a withered older woman with long dark hair, deep-set, watery eyes, and distinguishable triangles of rosacea on her cheeks. Supercomposite named her Loab. </span></p>
<p><span>She was even more surprised, though, when she fed images of the woman back into the machine, to witness an overwhelming trend of violence and gore among the results. In some, Loab is gaunt and desiccated like a mummy, blood dripping from her fingers. In others, her face ruptures and swells </span><span>as if she’s suffered a terrible accident. Sometimes, she is accompanied by small, childlike forms, among other recognisable horror imagery.</span></p>
<p><span>“I don't feel comfortable posting the most disturbing ones, borderline snuff images of dismembered, screaming children,” Supercomposite <a href="https://twitter.com/supercomposite/status/1567162334572945411">writes</a> on Twitter, alongside two particularly grotesque posts concealed by content warnings.</span></p><p><span>Unlike the internet legends that came before her, Loab wasn’t formed in any single human mind. Instead, she was born in the ‘imagination’ of an AI image generator. </span><span>“Imagine that the different concepts that the AI ‘knows’ about are drawn on a map, where ideas that are related cluster near to each other,” Supercomposite explains. “That's what we call the latent space. When you enter a prompt, like ‘Marlon Brando’, you basically tell the AI to walk towards the area of the latent space where the concept of Marlon Brando-ness is. It's optimising the image for maximum Brando-ness.”</span></p>
<p><span>Back in April, however, Supercomposite was experimenting with </span><span>“negatively weighted prompts” – in other words, she asked the AI to produce the farthest possible image from the concept of Marlon Brando. “</span><span>Negative prompt weights can have very strange effects and I wanted to explore areas of the AI’s data distribution that might be anomalous,” she says. The negative Marlon Brando prompt completely left the area of the latent space where the concept of humans and faces reside, and the AI spat out a “gibberish logo of a city skyline”. </span></p>
<p><span>Then, Supercomposite wondered what would happen if she asked for the furthest image from </span><em><span>that </span></em><span>– would it loop back around to a photo of Marlon Brando? </span><span>In short, no: it summoned Loab, the stuff of nightmares. More specifically, the process resulted in four images featuring Loab against various backdrops, including an album cover-style image with a title that gave Loab her name. They’re mostly fairly normal-looking; it’s when Loab was blended with other image prompts that things really started to get grisly.</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Through some kind of emergent statistical accident, something about this woman is adjacent to extremely gory and macabre imagery in the distribution of the AI#39;s world knowledge. <a href="https://t.co/BIrVPr0Qva">pic.twitter.com/BIrVPr0Qva</a></p>mdash; Supercomposite (@supercomposite) <a href="https://twitter.com/supercomposite/status/1567162324573642752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2022</a></blockquote>

<p><span>What did Supercomposite do, in the wake of this “discovery”? Well, following in the footsteps of believers in real-life cryptids such as Bigfoot and little green men, she swiftly generated some merch (apparently someone out there is already rocking a Loab-themed mini skirt). However, she also continued to experiment with the first Loab picture, mixing it with different prompts to create the unsettling images on her Twitter timeline.</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s super weird how cohesive [Loab] is,” she notes. “If you take an image of a celebrity and ask an AI to make variations of it without saying who it is, it often doesn’t do a great job; you get distorted people, who look kind of like the celebrity but not quite. But when you put Loab in, it reproduces Loab perfectly most of the time, with the shape of her cheeks and the shade of her skin, her expression.” Then, of course, there’s the gory hellscape she inhabits: “When you combine her images with other harmless images, it’s not uncommon for her to reappear mutilated or bleeding out of her eyes or neck.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite the demonic tinge to the Loab photos, of course, there are naysayers – the Agent Scullys to the Mulders of the Twitter timeline, if you will. These experts seek to dispel the claim that Supercomposite has laid eyes on the first cryptid of the latent space – or that Loab “haunts every image she touches”, moving through the space like a virus – using computer science and high-dimensional geometry. Ironically, these myth-busting explanations often sound as mysterious as the rites and rituals for summoning a real demon, describing a disembodied being dragged from the brains of millions of human artists, floating in space until someone finds the right combination of words to summon it. If that <em>isn’t </em>demonic, then what is?</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>In the end, though, even Supercomposite herself admits: “Loab isn’t really haunted, of course.” The more interesting question, perhaps, is how the Loab myth formed so quickly, and why. “It feels super strange, but cool, for it to take off like this, with people calling it a creepypasta,” she adds. </span></p>
<p><span>But should we be surprised? </span><span>If there’s one thing that’s clear, it’s that the rise of AI has put us more out of touch with the reality of modern technology than ever before. Everything from our shopping habits, to the images we see, to the way we interact with one another, is guided by invisible algorithms that regular people have no hope of understanding. It almost seems inevitable that we’d started to tell ourselves stories to simplify these processes, just like ancient civilisations made gods out of the stars. Loab isn’t </span><em><span>actually </span></em><span>an undead creature sent to haunt us, but could she be part of a new form of mythmaking, embedded with our fears about the boundless imagination of AI?</span></p>
<p><span>“The weirdest part is that future AIs will see everyone’s pictures and memes of Loab now,” says Supercomposite. “So they’ll start making even more Loabs. If we want to get rid of her, it’s already too late.”</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">Doja Cat’s eyebrows are the best thing in beauty right now</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Finally some exciting celebrity make-up!</h3>

<p><span>Celebrity beauty is rarely very exciting. Red carpet make-up, more often than not, is pretty but dull – and while there might be the occasional experimental editorial look, off-duty style generally follows the same unremarkable lines. Of course, there are some exceptions. </span><a href="/beauty/tag/billie-eilish"><span>Billie Eilish</span></a><span>’s once trademark </span><a href="/beauty/article/45137/1/billie-eilish-dyes-her-roots-slime-green-and-fans-are-obsessed"><span>neon green roots</span></a><span>, for example, was a style that felt genuinely fresh when she debuted it in 2019. But usually by the time looks have made their way up to the mainstream they have lost their element of originality. </span></p>
<p><span>Enter </span><a href="/tag/doja-cat"><span>Doja Cat</span></a><span>. A few weeks ago the musician debuted a shaved head and shaved eyebrows. The new look caused many online to </span><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/doja-cat-bald-black-women-hair-stigma-mental-health-rcna42197"><span>lose their minds</span></a><span> – it seems a lot of people believe the only reason a woman would shave her head is as a cry for help during a mental breakdown. However, Doja herself felt joy from the change and it has given her a completely blank slate on which to experiment with increasingly expressive and artistic make-up looks.</span></p><p><span>The eyebrows have been the most attention grabbing. Doja has been drawing them on, pencil-thin, often with a playful touch right in the centre of her arch. There have been small flowers, smiley faces, apples and hearts. One time what appeared to be sperm were painted on, wrapped around the brows. The eye looks that accompany the brows are usually just as creative. A space-themed liner involved intergalactic shapes in blues, pinks and yellows, while the sperm brows were joined by an experimental electric look.</span></p>
<p><span>Then there are her fashion week looks which have taken her beauty to the next level. Teaming up with make-up artist </span><a href="/beauty/article/46865/1/laurel-charleston-drag-make-up-artist-queer-lgbtq-new-york"><span>Laurel Charleston</span></a><span>, Doja wore a teletubby-esque look to the Marni show which saw her bald head painted orange. For the Vogue World runway presentation, Charleston painted a swirling white pattern across her face and head – a genuinely exciting front row beauty look that shows how expansive the possibilities of beauty can be. </span></p>
<p><span>So our message to Doja: keep it up! We’ve loved every second and no doubt we will continue to do so. Below we’ve rounded up some of our favourite of Doja’s beauty looks.</span></p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><span>Maverick photographer Roxanne Lowit, whose work gave unprecedented access into the beau monde of the glamorous elite, has passed away. The news broke this morning with a post on her Instagram account. “We are very sad to say we lost a remarkable woman today,” a caption read. “Roxanne Lowit was a legendary photographer who provided an intimate look into the world of fashion and showed us a side of nightlife that most people didn’t get to see.”</span></p>
<p><span>Born in New York in 1965, Lowit grew up between the Bronx and Long Island before studying textile design at FIT. There, she met fashion illustrator </span><a href="/art-photography/article/54235/1/antonio-lopez-is-the-fashion-illustrator-at-the-heart-of-1970s-hedonism"><span>Antonio Lopez</span></a><span>, who introduced Lowit to the hedonistic honeypot that was Greenwich Village in the 1960s – manned by the likes of </span><a href="/tag/jean-michel-basquiat"><span>Jean Michel Basquiat</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/tag/andy-warhol"><span>Andy Warhol</span></a><span>. “I had a good career as a textile designer, specialising in hand-painted textiles, but I wanted to paint portraits. It is one of the reasons I bought a camera, to photograph my friends and paint from the photos,” she explained to </span><a href="https://www.friendsfromnewyork.com/nystory"><span><em>Friends From New York</em></span></a><span> in December of 2020. “It was like my American Express card, I didn't leave home without it.”</span></p><p><span>After quitting her job at a textile firm and committing full-time to photography, Lowit lurched into the eye of the storm, venturing backstage at blockbuster fashion shows to capture VIP attendees, heads thrown back in laughter with cigarettes hanging from lips and champagne flutes in hand. The chaos, joy, and effortlessness of her backstage photography is widely credited with starting the genre – canonised in a 2013 exhibition simply titled </span><em><span>Roxanne Lowit: Be Fabulous</span></em><span>. Among candid portraits of </span><a href="/tag/grace-jones"><span>Grace Jones</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/tag/salvador-dali"><span>Salvador Dalí</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/fashion/gallery/19057/7/top-10-70s-icons"><span>Mick Jagger</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/fashion/article/55261/1/fashion-legend-andre-leon-talley-vogue-editor-has-died-age-73"><span>André Leon Talley</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/tag/kate-moss"><span>Kate Moss</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/tag/john-galliano"><span>John Galliano</span></a><span>, and the drag queen </span><a href="/tag/divine"><span>Divine</span></a><span> are iconic images that have been seared into public consciousness. Like that of the cackling “Trinity” – AKA </span><a href="/tag/naomi-campbell"><span>Naomi Campbell</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/tag/christy-turlington"><span>Christy Turlington</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="/tag/linda-evangelista"><span>Linda Evangelista</span></a><span> – bundled into </span><a href="/tag/donatella-versace"><span>Donatella Versace</span></a><span>’s bathtub in the Ritz. </span></p>
<p><span>Pre-Getty Images and pre-</span><a href="/fashion/article/56193/1/the-cobrasnake-indie-sleaze-2000s-mark-hunter-photo-book-sky-ferreira-lady-gaga"><span>Cobrasnake</span></a><span>, Lowit’s photography archived an era of absolute decadence and indulgence, where beautiful, badly-behaved supermodels snorted class As – not adaptogenic fizzy drinks. “There was definitely more of a playfulness back then,” Lowit told <em>The Star</em> in </span><a href="https://www.thestar.com/life/fashion_style/2014/02/18/backstage_fashion_photographer_roxanne_lowits_work_at_izzy_gallery.html"><span>2014</span></a><span>. “The models really had big personalities, and great charm. Today, I find that the girls are all kind of the same… the supermodels really got it.” Though fashion has managed to rebrand itself over the years, namely swapping out the word “aspirational” for “accessible”, there’s a reason why all the pageantry of the 90s continues to charm young designers and image-makers. A genuine glimpse behind the velvet curtain, Lowit’s work will forever be more authentic </span><span>than double-tapping a crying selfie on Instagram. </span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">#SeshTok: How harm reduction creators are promoting drug safety</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">As politicians continue to fail to protect drug users, TikTok users are spreading life-saving information online</h3>

	</figure>
<p><span>Love or loathe them, drugs are an undeniable part of youth culture: 15 per cent of all 18 to 24-year-olds in England and Wales report that they have </span><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/articles/victimisationanditsrelationshiptodrugmisusecommonmentalhealthdisorderandwellbeinginenglandandwales/yearendingmarch2021#:~:text=Any%20drug%20use,Appendix%20tables%201%20and%203)."><span>dabbled with drugs</span></a><span>. In spite of this, successive governments’ ‘war on drugs’ policies have created a society that stigmatises drug use and shut down vital conversations about harm reduction in the process.</span></p>
<p><span>But, </span><a href="https://www.drugwise.org.uk/does-drug-education-stop-drug-use/"><span>according to Drug Wise</span></a><span>, this approach is likely to be ineffective, and even counterproductive to the health of young people. </span><span>Sadly, deaths from drug poisoning have been on the rise since records began in 1993: in 2021, drug deaths were recorded at a rate 81 per cent higher than nine years previously in 2012.</span></p>
<p><span>Education is desperately needed to help reduce drug deaths, but the government’s policy remains </span><a href="https://theface.com/life/liz-truss-on-drugs-weed-conservatives-liberal-democrats-prime-minster"><span>unrobust</span></a><span>, to say the least. Now, TikTok is proving to be a powerful tool for breaking through this stigma, creating open conversations driven by creators who are passionate about teaching people how to sesh safely. Hashtags like #harmreduction, #pingtok and #addictionawareness have racked up millions of views on the app, providing a platform for people to discuss the importance of testing, the overlooked dangers of substance use, and tell-tale signs of overdose.</span></p><p><span>One of these creators is Teddy, who started making harm reduction content on Tiktok when she first joined the sobriety community online. “I wanted to be a part of it. I wanted to put in my opinion on things and help support others,” Teddy tells Dazed. “I had information that I could share.”</span></p>
<p><span>“There’s just not enough education available on how to keep people safe because of the demonization of drugs,” she continues. “When you eventually try [substances] and realise you’re not dead or haven’t ruined your life immediately, then you question the truth in these campaigns and whether you can keep doing it. Generally, there’s little education on how to use drugs safely and, because of that, people have lost their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span>Cara is another influencer pushing the narrative on how to use substances safely who has been creating harm reduction content on the platform since 2020. “It’s incredibly important to me,” Cara tells Dazed, recalling how her regular MDMA use left her with “bad mood swings” and severe memory loss. “A lot of young people don’t know the dangers, or at least how to use drugs safely. When I started there wasn’t much content about it, so I thought I’d start.”</span></p>
<p><span>Another creator is Simon Doherty, a freelance journalist and columnist about drug culture at </span><a href="https://theface.com/"><em><span>The Face</span></em></a><span>. Unlike Teddy and Cara, Simon’s harm reduction content veers away from personal anecdotes and focuses on sharing alerts made by the drug testing charity, </span><a href="https://wearetheloop.org/"><span>The Loop</span></a><span>. “One of the great things about The Loop is that the data has high validity,” he explains. “When they test at a festival they give information about the particular drugs that are going around at that time.”</span></p><p><span>TikTok is increasingly becoming one of the most powerful platforms to convey information to young people. A </span><a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/news-centre/2022/instagram,-tiktok-and-youtube-teenagers-top-three-news-sources"><span>recent report by Ofcom</span></a><span> even found that TikTok saw the largest overall increase in use as a news source over the last two years – with half of new users aged between 16 and 24.</span><span> “Young people are not interested in consuming linear television, and they’re certainly not interested in buying a newspaper,” Simon notes. “The way they consume information now is through social media.”</span></p>
<p><span>With this in mind, TikTok provides a vital space for guidance on drug use where people who need to see this information can easily access it. “When we have campaigns in schools or on television you’re being forced to consume that media,” Teddy adds. “On TikTok, it reaches people who actively want to engage with the content.”</span></p>
<p><span>But it’s not all plain sailing. Ultimately, anyone can post a drug-related video on TikTok, even if they have no credentials or expertise. As a result, misinformation can spread like wildfire. Plus, creators are constantly under threat of censorship, battling an algorithm pitted against them. “TikTok, like other forms of social media, does censor harm reduction content,” Jay Jackson, Head of Policy and Public Affairs at the research and advocacy organisation, </span><a href="https://volteface.me/"><span>Volteface</span></a><span>, told Dazed.</span></p>
<p><span>Creators in this space are often forced to adapt their language, using pseudonyms like “MDM@” and “AC!D” to minimise the threat of their content being removed and their profiles being banned or shadowbanned. Intentionally misspelling words has long been a tool in a creator’s arsenal when it comes to dodging stringent content moderation, but it’s a short-term fix – plus, it adds to the enduring stigmatisation of drug use and makes potentially complex information about drugs even harder to comprehend.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>When approached by Dazed, a spokesperson from TikTok said that the safety of their users is a top priority. “While we don’t allow the depiction, promotion or trade of drugs on TikTok, we support people who choose to share their personal experiences to raise awareness, educate and help others in our community who might be struggling,” they said.</span></p><p><span>“It’s a sticky situation,” Cara admits. “It should be a safe space but on the other hand, there are a lot of very young children on the platform.” Jay agrees. “[Social media companies] are only just protecting themselves, they probably don’t want to get a reputation for being a platform where drugs are spoken openly about,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span>“Ultimately it’s a dereliction of duty. They have a responsibility [to keep their users safe]. But if they’re going to come down on harm reduction content, they need to come down just as hard on people selling [drugs] on social media,” Jay continues. “People are buying drugs on social media, anywhere and everywhere.” He highlights a recent report from Volteface which found that 24 per cent of young people reported that they see illicit drugs </span><a href="https://volteface.me/publications/dm-details-selling-drugs-age-social-media/"><span>advertised for sale on social media</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>“This isn’t Wolf of Wall Street – this isn’t romanticising drugs, if anything it’s doing the opposite,” he adds, reflecting on harm reduction TikTok. “It’s making drugs boring: breaking them down into their chemical components, telling you the effects and how to do it as safely as possible. It’s actually an anti-glamourising tool. It takes away the mystery and intrigue of drugs.”</span></p>
<p><span>It’s a complex web to untangle. Ultimately, the emergence of this TikTok community reflects a deeper social issue – one that goes further than </span><em><span>just</span></em><span> teaching people how to sesh safely. It spotlights the inadequacies of our current education model around drugs, which is forcing creators to take matters into their own hands. </span></p>
<p><span>“Harm reduction [content] like this is a means to an end but they can only go so far… If we’re really focused on reducing the harm that drugs cause to individuals in society, it has to be set on a wider path,” Jay says. What would this path look like? For some, it means decriminalisation and legal regulation, for others, it means reforming an education system which communicates the nuanced issues surrounding drug use – instead of shrouding the topic in a blanket of fear.</span></p>
<p><span>Until then, however, content creators will continue to use TikTok to fill the information void: outsmarting algorithms and providing life-saving information to those who need it most.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>Is there anything left to say about <a href="/tag/david-bowie">David Bowie</a>? After countless books, articles, reissues, documentaries, anniversaries, reappraisals, and obituaries, is there anything left to unpack about one of the most ubiquitous, beloved and revolutionary pop stars of all time? </span></p>
<p><span>Many would argue not. However, extracting untold stories, personal details and biographical nuggets was of no appeal to </span><em><span>Moonage Daydream</span></em><span> director Brett Morgen (</span><em><span>Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck, Jane</span></em><span>). “It’s not a film about David Jones or David Bowie,” he says. “It’s about ‘Bowie’. The biographical parts were of no interest to me, nor do I think they would be something that David would have been interested in having me explore.” </span></p>
<p><span>Given the family’s blessing to make the film and with access to Bowie’s personal archive, containing five million assets, the resulting film is a non-linear music doc that explodes, loudly, as an audio-visual celebration. It’s so loud, in fact, that when it had its UK Premiere earlier this summer at Sheffield Doc/Fest, where I caught up with Morgen, the live sound mix was so intense that the opening footage of Bowie as Ziggy Stardust in 1972 had the cinema seats literally rattling. </span></p><p><span>It was always intended to be an explosion of sound and colour, with Morgen so set against following the tropes of linear biographical storytelling that he even wrote his own rulebook for the film. “I had a 48-page manifesto,” he says. “Rather than having a traditional script, I needed a guide for myself on how to construct this experience. The rules included: no dates, no biographical information and no timeline.” </span></p>
<p><span>There are no talking heads or voiceover either and despite some minor biographical concessions, that Morgen “agonised over”, it’s a film rooted in visual spectacle – a kaleidoscopic exploration of Bowie as an artist, which heightens the potency of his music, words, and creative process. “Unlike a lot of other musicians, David has a philosophy and very specific approach that he's created towards art,” Morgen says. “So, I was able to incorporate those techniques into the construction of the film. It’s pretty rare to have a subject provide the DNA like that – the mapping for the excursion.” </span></p>
<p><span>Morgen’s own life path would even end up being somewhat shaped by this excursion map too. At the beginning of production, he had a heart attack and spent four days in a coma. And even though he worked on this film obsessively, tirelessly, and “harder than anything else I’ve ever worked on” he’s keen to point out it was Bowie that saved him, not nearly killed him. “This film didn't cause a heart attack,” he says. “It wasn't from the stress of the film. The relationship between the heart attack and the film is that the film helped me recover.”</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="9WIKPE2PMi4"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9WIKPE2PMi4" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Working on the film, Morgen began to adopt some of Bowie’s philosophies toward art and life as they became manifest on screen. This shifted the tone and narrative of the film, as Morgen leaned more into the idea of Bowie as a dedicated figure who was committed to art, pushing himself to the extreme, but also one who knew when to withdraw and let love and domesticity play as vital a role. “The lessons I’ve learned are now being put into action,” he says. “I still am obsessed with my work but I learned to not allow the work to define what and who I am.”  </span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps, as a result, the film is an overwhelmingly positive portrayal of Bowie as an unimpeachable music icon, often drifting more towards a tribute than a document, as it smoothly glides over controversies or topics such as serious drug abuse. However, Morgen simply feels that’s the only story that could be told with the material provided. “Some people may think that it should be more critical of the subject,” he says. “I approached this with an open eye, I didn’t have an agenda, but with Bowie I don’t think there was a possibility to create a film that was more critical of him with the media that I had access to.”</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>In fact, Morgen has become so obsessed with Bowie that he’s unable to listen to any other music, even after a seven-year production period on the film, and speaks about him in almost guru-like terms. “Watching all that footage, there was nothing I witnessed that was not awe-inspiring on a moment-to-moment, day-to-day basis,” he says. “I have no qualms about this. I'm not an objective filmmaker, I'm a method director. I try to create an experience of the subject in order to get there. I need to understand how my characters sleep, eat and drink, even though I may never mention what they may sleep, eat or drink. My appreciation and respect for him just continued to grow every day. I don't have enough descriptions for it...I've never encountered another human being as inspiring.”  </span></p>
<p><span>The film is primarily focused on Bowie’s imperial decade of the 1970s and even though it quickly zips through the 90s and 2000s, a period some view as an artist lost in the wilderness chasing a zeitgeist that he once set, Morgen feels this is an era that is deeply misunderstood. “People dismissed David as trying to exploit culture and trying to get with youth music and shit,” he says. “What’s so frustrating in retrospect, is that was what David always did. He always appropriated popular music and made it his own.” </span></p>
<p><span>Given that it’s a film intended to capture the experience of Bowie as an ever-changing artist rather than the background story of David Jones, it was constructed and designed specifically for cinemas, to allow colours to pop, guitars to crunch and Bowie’s voice to soar. So, Morgen is somewhat evangelical about experiencing the film as it was intended. “I spent the past year working on a sound design that you’re not going to get at home,” he says. “So, you’re not getting the same film and please don't offend me by saying it is the same. It’s the chosen medium that the artist wants to work in and that is how one should see their work. It’s like having an art show and being like, ‘oh you don’t need to come, I’ll send you pictures’. I spent so much time and energy trying to create something for a space that I hope it can be experienced there.” </span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Red Rose: The story behind the year’s most unsettling TV show</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">A new BBC horror series, Red Rose, follows a group of Bolton teenagers in the thrall of a destructive, mysterious app</h3>

<p><span>Many regard the northwest of England to be a place haunted by its own history. If that’s true, you might consider the Clarkson Twins to be geographical exorcists. After working on fantasy drama </span><em><span>The Wheel of Time </span></em><span>and Mike Flanagan’s </span><em><span>The Haunting of Bly Manor</span></em><span>, screenwriters Paul and Michael Clarkson have returned to their hometown of Bolton for their new BBC creation, </span><em><span>Red Rose</span></em><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The show follows a group of teenagers navigating their post-GCSE summer, when a mysterious app begins to influence their lives, placing them on a path which may just lead to their own self-destruction. The app, known as Red Rose, first appears on Isis Hainsworth’s steely-yet-vulnerable Rochelle, seducing her into using it under the guise of “helping” her. After seemingly restoring power to her house, Red Rose threatens to expose Rochelle’s use of food banks and taunts her with the spectral image of her dead mother.</span></p>
<p><span>Some viewers may find similarities between </span><em><span>Red Rose</span></em><span>’s sadistic challenges and the mysterious </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-46505722"><span>Blue Whale</span></a><span> internet urban legend that emerged in 2016. Supposedly, this challenge issued increasingly dangerous tasks to teenagers across the world that ultimately would lead to fatal consequences. While</span><span> the creators insist that Blue Whale isn’t related to <em>Red Rose,</em> both undoubtedly touch on a core tenet of the internet’s malicious potential: our perception of reality is indelibly, and perhaps permanently, warped by our reliance on technology. </span></p><p><span>Speaking over Zoom from their homes in London and Bolton, the pair explain how they grounded much of </span><em><span>Red Rose</span></em><span>’s terror into a simple but powerful rule: “The simpler it is, the scarier it is.” They did this by making phones their focus. “Communication can easily be misleading – it’s become endemic in society, which has led to a lot of devastating consequences,“ explains Paul. “So we said, ‘let’s embrace the phones, let’s lean into this and try to use [them] to their full potential.”</span></p>
<p><span>Despite infusing the show with the supernatural, ensuring it felt true to life was essential. But one of the greatest difficulties in writing stories centred around teenagers and the internet is the rapidly evolving natures of both: “We spoke with a lot of nieces and nephews and went into our old secondary school to do focus groups with teens to find out how their lives were, and what the key differences were,” says Michael. “That was obviously technology, but the utilisation of it was still simple.”</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="L-bsFMFJMk8"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-bsFMFJMk8" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>The pair found that social media fed three fundamental needs: care, attention, and a desire to feel seen and heard. “People attach themselves emotionally to what they create online”, says Paul. “The digital self we create on social media is part of us – but we are in a technological age where few people understand what they’re using beyond the surface level. No one knows how it’s coded, where it’s transmitted to – who is that data going to?”</span></p>
<p><span>Where </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>truly twists the knife is in its reflection of the frightening uncertainty of working-class families like Rochelle’s, our initial teenage protagonist leading us into the world of </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span> – at a time where </span><a href="https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/20276467.bolton-child-poverty-exceeds-national-average/"><span>41 per cent</span></a><span> of children live in poverty in southeast Bolton</span><a href="https://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/20276467.bolton-child-poverty-exceeds-national-average/"><span></span></a><span>, her struggle to merely keep the lights on feels all too real. The sociopolitical undercurrent of the show is carried through Isis Hainsworth’s Rochelle, the first but certainly not the last to fall for </span>Red Rose <span>as a result of having no other option. This emphasis on the psychological entwined with the technological draws distinct parallels to </span><em><span>Black Mirror</span></em><span>, which actress Amelia Clarkson who plays Wren Davis is a huge fan of: “I think what I’m obsessed with is the psychological darkness of it all.”</span></p><blockquote>
<p><span>“Your phone lives in your pocket – it’s always there. It can control the way you feel so much even though we could just turn it off and not feel it anymore. I think that’s really scary” – Isis Hainsworth</span></p>
</blockquote><p><span>Speaking over Zoom, Clarkson, Isis Hainsworth and Natalie Blair each explain that what truly scares them about </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>is its reflection of how impossible it is to untether ourselves from our phones. “Your phone lives in your pocket – it’s always there,” says Hainsworth. “It can control the way you feel so much even though we could just turn it off and not feel it anymore. I think that’s really scary.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I think </span><em><span>Red Rose</span></em><span> pushes on that disconcerting emotional numbness you get from scrolling,” adds Clarkson. “You’re so emotionally manipulated that you can’t go off your natural emotions and feelings like you can in real life.”</span></p>
<p><span>That </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>begins at such a seminal moment in their adolescence is an integral part of the show, says Clarkson: “I think everyone understands that pinnacle post-GCSE summer where </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>starts – it felt like such a malleable phase where anything could happen, and it would shape who you were after.” For the twins, this malleability is precisely what makes these teenagers most vulnerable to the app: “</span>Red Rose <span>exploits shame, because if you can control someone’s shame, you can control them – so, technology plus shame plus manipulation creates a powerfully terrifying pressure.” However, the pair wanted to use </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>to demonstrate how someone could free themselves from that torment: “Once you’re open about things, suddenly they lose their power.”</span><span> </span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>When watching </span><em><span>Red Rose</span></em><span>, it’s undeniable that the feeling of an industrial town trapped in time encapsulates an eerie stillness, as Paul found when they returned to location scout. “When we were walking round Bolton, someone described it as a Thatcherite graveyard.” For that reason, </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>couldn’t have been made anywhere else – the script and the characters are clearly infused with the indomitable Northern spirit, a region eternally haunted by its past through a stagnated present: “A lot of people grow up fast in Bolton. There are benefits and downsides because there’s an element of tragedy there… it’s a story of all former industrial towns that have lost their once-beating economic heart.”</span></p>
<p><span>Most importantly though, </span><em><span>Red Rose </span></em><span>gives a voice to the millions of working-class people throughout the United Kingdom, at a time when they must shout louder than ever. For Michael, this is one of the most important aspects of the show. “We’re excited for the working class across the country to watch this – because if we were teenagers watching </span><em><span>Red Rose</span></em><span>, we would feel seen and heard.”</span></p>]]>

<p><span>It’s hard to believe that it’s taken this long for a <a href="/tag/k-pop">K-Pop</a> star to make a proper <a href="/tag/nyfw">New York Fashion Week</a> cameo. Though members of <a href="/tag/blackpink">BLACKPINK</a> and <a href="/tag/bts">BTS</a> have lined the front rows of major maisons for the past couple of seasons, it was <a href="/fashion/article/55671/1/peter-do-is-best-in-show-new-york-fashion-week-aw22-fw22-celine-phoebe-philo">Peter Do</a> who first put an Icon to work – casting NCT member JENO in as the protagonist of his new menswear imprint. “It was a natural choice to have JENO open the show. JENO embodies the Peter Do man – multifaceted, confident, and a trailblazer,” Do explained in a press release. “I have so much respect for these artists because there is so much time put into their craft that people simply don’t see. Few realise the intensity of what is happening behind the scenes to achieve the end product; it’s very similar to fashion so I identify with that process very much.”</span></p>
<p><span>A collaboration with SM Entertainment, Red Velvet’s Seulgi and SMROOKIES’ Shohei and Eunseok also emerged on the runway. While these appearances seem to contradict Do’s relationship with celebrity  – he’s obscured his face with black masks since long before the pandemic – the designer’s decision to link up with the behemoth pop label holds personal resonance. Alongside a hand-written note, traditional biscuits from the first ever Vietnamese bakery in New York, a needle, thread, measuring tape, </span><span>and a recipe from his late father, a tin box invitation included a CD mix tape with </span><span>a QR code linking to a K-Pop Spotify playlist. </span><span>“There’s the nostalgia of listening to Girls’ Generation songs on the bus on my way to school. And when we started the brand, we were listening to Red Velvet on repeat while building studio furniture,” he noted.</span></p><p><span>Do’s come a long way since then and today’s menswear offering further widened his horizons – even despite customers of all genders already buying into his sharp, languid fashions. Schooled under <a href="/tag/Phoebe-Philo">Phoebe Philo</a>, there was something that felt particularly edifying about the designer’s take on mens clothing; it wasn’t a “younger brother” to the Peter Do woman, but an equal. A broadened shoulder here, a tapered waist there, masc-presenting models wore studded platform boots, pleated skirts, overblown blazers, and leather slacks that pooled at the ankle. In a tribute uploaded to Instagram before the show, Do reflected on the timewarp he experienced after his father’s passing – “Dad’s have a tendency of doing that don’t they?“ – which gave new meaning to his signature too-big tailoring, creating the impression of children trundling out in their parents’ work suits.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

Though Tommy Hilfiger is perhaps best known for varsity jackets, rugby jerseys, and classic denim, under his new see now, buy now imprint – TommyNow – the designer debuted whips, chest harnesses, and studded leather jackets. Where so many other runways have fallen dark this season, SS23 felt as though Hilfiger and co were making a deliberate effort to shake off its girl next door persona: casting a gimp in the attack as its SS23 protagonist.			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Christina Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

The behemoth collection boasted striped, oversized polos that hung at the knees like dresses, cape-like puffer jackets in red, white, and blue, slouchy trench coats and blazers, thick ties, and power suits in interlocking H-H monograms. As rain splattered onto the runway, an inclusive cast of old, young, fat, and trans models suggested a contemporary take on prepsters, among them Julia Fox, Paloma Elsesser, Winnie Harlow, Precious Lee, and Richie Shazam.			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Christina Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

At one point Travis Barker clambered out of his front row seat, unlatched himself from a mammoth padded coat, and joined an on-stage band to thrash on some kind of drum. Closing the show was Tommy Hilfiger’s collaboration with Richard Quinn, comprising overblown chintzy puffers, hard and fast biker jackets, zip-up bodysuits, and leather sex harnesses. 			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Christina Fragkou</span>		</figcaption>

<p><span>As one of the world’s most famous – and infamous – artists, <a href="/andy-warhol">Andy Warhol</a>’s influence on pop culture can’t be understated. The All-American artist might have passed away close to 40 years ago, but countless creatives continue to find inspiration in his pioneering spirit, bolshy AF artwork, and the vibrant, rag-tag community he forged around him. And we mean, come on – that whole “Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes” thing? Warhol was something of a soothsayer, essentially predicting the rise of reality TV and later social media. </span></p><p><span>After meeting Warhol in the early 1980s, <a href="/tommy-hilfiger">Tommy Hilfiger</a> is among those who count him as an ongoing influence. In fact, the two creatives’ careers share plenty of parallels, with Hilfiger’s immediately recognisable logo similarly ensconced in the aesthetic lexicon of the U S of A. It makes sense, then, that Hilfiger would not just reference Warhol, but throw a massive, blockbuster homage show in celebration of his return to his hometown of <a href="/nyfw">New York City</a>, after a few seasons schlepping across the world. And despite it being a truly grotty, grey, and extremely wet afternoon in the Big Apple, little could dampen the energy and spectacle of the house’s AW22 <a href="/ss23"></a>show. Didn’t catch the livestream? Invite lost in the post? We have you covered. Here’s everything you need to know. </span></p>

<p><span>Mention Warhol’s factory to pretty much anyone in the know and the first thing that will probably come to mind is the fact the whole space was covered in silver foil. Cut to 2022, and Tommy Hilfiger took the idea to a whole new level, plastering the material throughout the backstage area of his AW22 show. With guests ushered through the usually top secret, limited access space on the way to the arena where the runway had been set up, they got a glimpse of how a fashion show comes together – as models sat down to get their make-up and hair done, and members of the production team endlessly ran about speaking into walkie talkies – and became part of the show themselves. Outside, the theme continued, with a silver foil-wrapped vat full of Tommy-branded water, a t-shirt printing kiosk, and a photo booth all lining the walkway to the showspace. </span></p>

<p><span>Julia Fox! Lila Moss! Ashley Graham! Alton Mason! Hari Nef! Paloma Elsesser! The list goes on and on. Almost as major (or perhaps even more so?) was the front row, where Kris Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian Barker and husband Travis, and Kate Moss rubbed shoulders with Factory legends Lady Bunny and Jane Forth. It might have been pouring with rain in Greenpoint (and across New York for that matter) but spirits stayed high in anticipation of Tommy’s big NY comeback. </span></p>
<h1><strong>ONE </strong><strong><em>INTERVIEW</em></strong><strong> ICON amp; A WARHOL MUSE WALKED </strong></h1><p><span>Hilfiger wasn’t about to do things by halves for AW22 and so invited two OG members of </span><em><span>Interview</span></em><span> magazine’s team to walk the runway (in case you’re not familiar, Warhol was the founder of the pioneering mag). Making his way out onto the runway was Bob Calacello, former editor-in-chief, and Donna Jordan, muse of both Warhol and fashion illustrator Antonio Lopez stomped out onto the soaked space in slick, offbeat tailoring that harked back to the Factory’s 70s heyday. </span></p>

<p><span>As well as the aforementioned tailoring, there were endless nods to the 60s, 70s, and 80s, as models wearing beatnik-esque wool roll-necks and short-shorts strut down the catwalk. There were also heavy wool peacoats, duffles, and chunky cardigans, with one model even sporting a peroxide blonde bowl cut not dissimilar to Andy Warhol’s own bleached mop. Elsewhere, babydoll dresses with matched with go-go boots in autumnal hues, and blown-up, oversized outerwear got the monogram treatment, courtesy of designer <a href="/fashion/article/56780/1/fergus-purcell-on-what-inspired-his-fresh-take-on-the-tommy-hilfiger-logo">Fergus Purcell</a> – who, in case you missed it, is the man behind Tommy’s newest iconography. </span></p>

	</figure>
<p><span>A surprising partnership, maybe, but one that worked on the night. Hilfiger first came across the rising London designer at the British Fashion Awards last year, and was blown away by his costumes for Kylie Minogue and her cohort of dancers. One thing led to another, and before he knew it, Quinn was let loose in the Tommy archives, turning out a collection that spliced the All-American label’s preppy, varsity stylings with his own floral motifs and flourishes. </span></p>
<h1><strong>PRECIOUS LEE HAD A DOMINATRIX MOMENT</strong></h1>	<figure>

<p><span>The casting of the show was refreshingly diverse, with models of many sizes all getting their moment on the catwalk. Best of all was new gen supermodel Precious Lee, who strutted through the space in a monogrammed denim catsuit with a long black whip clutched in hand. Step on me, Precious Lee!</span></p>

<p><span>“Travis, I wanna mosh!” said Kourtney K (presumably) from her position in the front row. The Blink-182 drummer and new TH campaign star obviously complied, swapping the frow for the stage and stripping off his enormous coat. As models took their final lap and rain beat down hard on the audience, Barker thrashed at the drums as everything came to a close. Welcome home, Tommy – we’ve missed you almost as much as we’ve missed the drama.</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Kelela is officially back with new single, ‘Washed Away’</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">It’s the singer’s first release since 2017</h3>

<div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="A45gzN0cgow"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A45gzN0cgow" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>After dropping a number of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiY2CXODBff/"><span>cryptic hints</span></a><span> on social media over the weekend, which left many fans speculating the singer’s long-awaited return, <a href="/tag/kelela">Kelela</a> has officially shared a new track, “Washed Away”.</span></p>
<p><span>The ethereal single is Kelela’s first new music since the release of her 2017 </span><span>acclaimed debut album, </span><em><span>Take Me Apart</span></em><span>. “I love a banger, but for the first point of contact out of my hiatus, it felt more honest to lead with an ambient heart-check,” she said in a press release.</span></p>
<p></p><p><span>It comes accompanied by a music video directed by Yasser Abubeker that features Kelela amid the elements of the Danakil Depression, which sits in the northern section of Ethiopia’s Afar region. “I specifically want to speak to marginalised Black folk and highlight the work we do to find renewal</span><span> in a world that’s built to make us feel inadequate</span><span>. This song is the soundtrack to the relief we find after going inward,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span>Kelela initially broke through in 2013 with the release of her </span><em>Cut 4 Me </em><span>mixtape, shortly followed by her first EP </span><em>Hallucinogen</em><span> in 2015. In October 2018, the artist released a </span><em>Take Me Apart</em><span> remix project featuring the likes of Hitmakerchinx, LSDXOXO, Gaika and Kaytranada.</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Legendary director Jean-Luc Godard has died </h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">One of the defining figures of the French New Wave, Godard’s influence on popular culture is incalculable</h3>

<p><span>Film director <a href="/tag/jean-luc-godard">Jean-Luc Godard</a>, a leading figure of the French New Wave which revolutionised cinema in the 1960s, has died at the age of 91.</span></p>
<p><span>Godard’s first feature, </span><em><span>Breathless</span></em><span> (1960)</span><em><span>,</span></em><span> has become one of the most seminal films of all time. Even if you haven’t seen it, you’ll almost certainly have seen another director ripping it off. It has been celebrated for its distinctive visual style, incorporating quick camera work, jump cuts (an abrupt transition that makes the subject seem to jump from one spot to the other without continuity) and rapid editing, all of which create a frenetic, amphetamine-like quality. </span></p>
<p><span>According to Godard, his use of jump cuts was simply a matter of necessity – the film he had made was an hour over the contracted running time – but he can still be credited with introducing them as a stylistic technique in popular cinema. Godard later said of</span><em><span> Breathless</span></em><span>, “It was a film that took everything that cinema had done – girls, gangsters, cars – exploded all this and put an end, once and for all, to the old style.”</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="_fcRj0SXYh8"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_fcRj0SXYh8" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Godard’s work in the 1960s – which also included </span><em><span>Le Mépris </span></em><span>(Contempt), </span><em><span>Bande à Part</span></em><span> (Band of Outsiders), </span><em><span>Vivre Sa Vivre </span></em><span>(To Live Her Life), and </span><em><span>Alphaville –</span></em><span> went on to have a profound influence on the directors who defined 1970s American (the so-called “second golden age of Hollywood). Martin Scorsese and Francis Ford Coppola both drew inspiration from his work, as did Arthur Penn, the director of </span><em><span>Bonnie and Clyde </span></em><span>(1967) – which was widely considered the first American film to incorporate the style of the French New Wave (even if Godard himself once described it as a “</span><a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound/interviews/jean-luc-godard-la-chinoise-usa"><span>dead film</span></a><span>” in front of a horrified American audience).</span></p>
<p><span> Quentin Tarantino, perhaps the most famous Godard fan, would emerge a couple of decades later. Both </span><em><span>Pulp Fiction</span></em><span> (1994)</span><span> </span><span>and </span><em><span>Reservoir Dogs</span></em><span> (1992) pay self-conscious homage to Godard (as Tarantino himself would tell anyone who listened) and went on to become enormously influential in their own right. In a roundabout way, Godard’s distinctive techniques – most notably the jump cut – also came to shape the world of advertising and music videos.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="8fBWBnqkglc"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fBWBnqkglc" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Godard’s films remain among the most definitive symbols of a particular kind of aloof, understated French glamour, and have influenced the world of fashion, inspiring collections by Anna Sui, Rodarte and Band of Outsiders. His female protagonists – with their Breton-stripe sweaters, oversized button-up white shirts and pixie cuts – are still being used as stylistic references today. And so while Godard may be gone, it is certain that his impact will be felt for many generations to come.</span></p>]]>

<p>It’s approaching that time of year everyone looks forward to – Christmas! But two months before that is the 2022 <a href="/tag/london-film-festival">BFI London Film Festival</a>, which runs from October 5 to 16. As usual, the LFF (as you will find yourself calling it) collates the best movies from the upcoming months, as well as some that may never receive distribution or play in theatres again. It’s also a rare chance to see a Hollywood A-lister walk up and down the corridors of your local Vue and ask directions for Screen 7 Cinema!</p>
<p>With tickets on sale to the public now, it’s your opportunity to see the best films that will come out in late 2022, 2023, and perhaps even 2024 before all your friends. Not only is this the only way to see the <em>Knives Out</em> sequel without having the ending spoiled, there’s often filmmakers and cast flying over to do screening introductions and Qamp;As.</p><p>And as members of the public can purchase tickets to the red-carpet gala events, you can walk alongside the stars, and then find yourself sat behind them. For example, if you nab the right seat to <em>My Policeman</em>, you may find yourself within spitting distance of Harry Styles.</p>
<p>Importantly: if you’re aged 16 to 25, there are <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=25andunderamp;BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id=" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink%3D25andunder%26BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::context_id%3Damp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663154504517000amp;usg=AOvVaw3l9erHr6Hd1lAoAFKqqv4f">several films where tickets are only £5</a>. If you’re 26 – well, maybe you can hide in the toilets a few hours before the film starts and walk in for free. (Just kidding. <em>Don’t do that.</em>) Otherwise, the festival is screening 164 features (some will also be simulcast outside of London), numerous shorts, and a handful of TV series. There will also be an Immersive Art and Extended Realities strand – you’ll have to turn up in person to see what <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink=hauntedhotel" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/lff/Online/default.asp?BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::permalink%3Dhauntedhotelamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1663154504517000amp;usg=AOvVaw1AvXZY7WONNMqyQZK_PlG5">Guy Maddin has done with augmented reality</a>.</p>
<p>To save you from the stress of having too much choice, we’ve hand-selected 10 highlights from this year’s lineup. There’s a donkey-starring drama, Lars von Trier’s <em>Twin Peaks</em>, and much, much more.</p><h1><em>CLOSE</em>, LUKAS DHONT</h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="S7sw223zTuU"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S7sw223zTuU" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>The Belgian filmmaker’s queer coming-of-ager made everyone cry at Cannes, and then made everyone angry when it didn’t won the Palme d’Or. Already a frontrunner for the International Feature Oscar, <em>Close</em> also gained a reputation for a shocking plot twist. For now, all you need to know is that it’s about two young boys, and you’ll want to see it unspoiled – its UK release will probably be in 2023.</p>
<h1><span><em>EO</em>, JERZY SKOLIMOWSKI </span></h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="JLGWCJTZ1TM"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JLGWCJTZ1TM" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>At 84 years old, the iconic Polish filmmaker has delivered what many believe to be his greatest accomplishment: a devastating drama in which a donkey is the protagonist. Unlike <em>Au Hasard Balthazar</em>, the award-winning <em>EO </em>(titled after a braying sound) really positions the grey, sombre creature front and centre. If you really need humans in your arthouse cinema – there’s a cameo from Isabelle Huppert.</p>
<h1><em>TORI AND LOKITA</em>, JEAN-PIERRE AND LUC DARDENNE</h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="KovHXQRsEtY"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KovHXQRsEtY" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>The ultimate film bros are back. As expected, the Dardennes have crafted a furious, political drama with their trademark over-the-shoulder camera style, this time following two young Black teens facing massive injustice. After being smuggled from Africa into Belgium, Tori and Lokita pretend to be brother and sister in order to survive, but face further threats: they’re exploited, face blackmail, and are forced into crime. The <em>Hollywood Reporter</em> speculated that it’s the Belgium filmmakers’ “saddest film” to date.</p>
<h1><em>BECOMING PLANT</em>, GRACE NDIRITU</h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="TZKAeXaWJWA"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TZKAeXaWJWA" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>If you were concerned about your mental health and were looking for an excuse to get fucked up on hallucinogens, then <em>Becoming Plant</em> is essential viewing (and chewing). In April 2021, six dancers ingested a psilocybin mushroom called the Golden Teacher, ripped off their clothes, and choreographed naked performances to align their bodies with plants. With an original score by Gaika, the experimental film tackles how we can escape the stress of the modern world by embracing drugs and nature. Think of it as another form of touching grass.</p>
<h1><span><em>DE HUMANI CORPORIS FABRICA</em>, LUCIEN CASTAING-TAYLOR, VERENA PARAVEL</span></h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="LS6EQRQ2Vxk"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LS6EQRQ2Vxk" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>With a title that will make you sound really smart when you tell your friends about your weekend plans, <em>De Humani Corporis Fabrica</em> is a hypnotic, provocative exploration of the flesh and mess that is the human body. By taking their cameras into hospitals, the filmmaking duo responsible for 2012’s <em>Leviathan</em> provide close-ups of the brain, your intestines, and all the other gross bits inside you – but projected onto a disgustingly big screen.</p>
<h1><span><em>GODLAND</em>, HLYNUR PÁLMASON</span></h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="_72WOvp9VU8"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_72WOvp9VU8" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>After <em>A White, White Day</em>, Pálmason was already pinpointed as a name to watch. But <em>Godland</em>, if reviews from Cannes are to believed, is one of the year’s best and a must-see on the big screen. In the late 19th century, a Danish priest is asked to trek to Iceland to build a church for the locals, and photograph the surroundings: the snowy vistas, the volcanos, and even the rotting creatures. In doing so, he contemplates religion, colonialism, and the role of the lens. According to <em>Sight amp; Sound</em>, it’s “a film of extraordinary craft and power”.</p>
<h1><span><em>NEXT SOHEE</em>, JULY JUNG </span></h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="DwUVZlIy-xg"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwUVZlIy-xg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>After 2014’s <em>A Girl at My Door</em>, the film world eagerly awaited what July Jung would do next. Eight years later, she’s returned with a workplace drama loosely based on a real, worrying story. When a teenage girl, Sohee, takes her life, an investigation reveals that the otherwise cheerful youngster was being exploited at a stressful call-centre job. As well as its topical exploration of toxic workplaces and how industries can improve, <em>Next Sohee</em> promises fine acting – it stars Doona Bae from <em>The Host</em> and <em>Linda Linda Linda</em>.</p>
<h1><em>SICK OF MYSELF</em>, KRISTOFFER BORGLI</h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="Cmxdic8IxD0"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cmxdic8IxD0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>A provocative Norwegian comedy about two edgelords trying to outdo each other, <em>Sick of Myself </em>is like the competitive flirting scene in <em>The Worst Person in the World</em> – in reverse. Set in Oslo, Borgli’s third feature introduces a male artist, Thomas, whose latest schtick is an installation of stolen chairs. Jealous of his minor fame, Signe (played by Kristine Kujath Thorp from <em>Ninjababy</em>), his girlfriend, downs pharmaceuticals to deliberately develop a Cronenbergian skin disease and amass media attention. You will watch through your fingers as to how it escalates.</p>
<h1><span><em>WHITE NOISE</em>, NOAH BAUMBACH</span></h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="FqJD7ae11mU"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FqJD7ae11mU" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>While you eagerly await Greta Gerwig’s <em>Barbie</em>, which she co-wrote with Noah Baumbach, there’s Baumbach’s Gerwig-starring adaptation of Don DeLillo’s <em>White Noise</em> – a talky drama that allegedly cost $140 million. Starring Adam Driver as a professor of Hitler studies, Baumbach’s black comedy mixes the director’s trademark observations about family life (Gerwig and Driver are married, thus living out a <em>Frances Ha</em> fantasy) with the threat of a so-called Airborne Toxic Event. Also look out for Jodie Turner-Smith, Andre 3000, and a comeback song from LCD Soundsystem.</p>
<h1><span><em>THE KINGDOM EXODUS</em>, LARS VON TRIER</span></h1><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="AJ6LAGxiYKc"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJ6LAGxiYKc" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>When the first two seasons of <em>The Kingdom</em> aired in the 1990s, Lars von Trier openly called it his version of <em>Twin Peaks</em>. And like David Lynch’s TV creation, <em>The Kingdom</em> has returned for a third season, several decades later – and these LFF screenings might be the only chance to catch it on the big screen. Set in a soapy, supernatural hospital in Copenhagen where staff can be impregnated by a ghost, <em>The Kingdom Exodus</em> allows von Trier to be as ridiculous and controversial as he pleases – this time with Willem Dafoe and Alexander Skarsgård joining the cast.</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">The housing crisis is alive, but love is dead</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">As affordable properties become scarce, living with a partner is becoming less about romance and more about cost-cutting</h3>

<p><span>24-year-old Ellie* lives with her ex-boyfriend.</span></p>
<p><span>The pair of them split a while ago, and have since informed their landlord that they’ll be moving out. But, as Ellie has found, it’s not been as simple as packing her bags and parachuting into the first spare room available: at the moment, she can’t find anywhere that she can afford.</span></p>
<p><span>“On SpareRooms, people have been telling me that they’re getting up to 400 messages for one room. On Facebook groups, I’ve seen people advertising spare rooms for £1,400 a month, and people posting about having to sofa surf because they can’t find anywhere to live,” she tells me. “It just feels strange – even though I’ve got a full-time job, I’m unable to find somewhere to live, without having the financial backing of being with a partner.”</span></p><p><span>Breakups are always painful – but this added stress is making the experience even more unbearable for Ellie. “It’s made separating harder as we both have nowhere else to go to,” she continues, adding that “resentment” is building between the two of them. “It feels like our only options are to move home or sleep on friends’ sofas.”</span></p>
<p><span>“It’s made me regret separating purely because at least looking for places as a couple makes things slightly more affordable and there’s a bit less competition,” she adds. “It definitely was a consideration when we were deciding to split as to whether we could actually even afford to do so.”</span></p>
<p><span>For young people, moving in with a partner has always been a big relationship milestone – just as it was for Ellie and her partner. </span><span>Dispiritingly, though, in recent years, moving in with a partner has become less about taking a relationship to the next level, and more about convenience. Things have gotten considerably worse over the past 12 months: in many places, </span><a href="https://propertyindustryeye.com/tenants-staying-for-longer-to-avoid-being-faced-with-higher-rents/"><span>renters are staying put for longer</span></a><span> to avoid higher rents elsewhere, meaning there are fewer houses on the market. Meanwhile, incoming regulations have encouraged some landlords to sell up. Essentially, demand is far outstripping supply, leaving desperate and vulnerable tenants with zero bargaining power.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“It just feels strange – even though I’ve got a full-time job, I’m unable to find somewhere to live, without having the financial backing of being with a partner” – Ellie</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>As a result, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/aug/28/bidding-wars-cash-up-front-and-auditions-inside-britains-broken-renting-market"><span>‘bidding wars’</span></a><span> are becoming increasingly common, where tenants are forced to offer over a property’s listed price just to stand out from the swathes of other prospective tenants. Stories of </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hydratedtoe2/status/1520356837366931456?s=20amp;t=6KYS94Rq6ALfKgj4mZLN0A"><span>over  50 people</span></a><span> turning up to view a single flat abound online. Stats paint a bleak picture too: in the 12 months leading up to July 2022, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) recorded the largest annual growth rate of private rental prices since its index began in 2016.</span></p>
<p><span>This, in turn, is wreaking havoc on relationships. Some, like Ellie and her ex, are finding that the moving out process at the end of a cohabiting relationship is needlessly and painfully protracted. Others are finding themselves owing their partners thousands in rent money. Many are unable to even move in together, or even live in the same city, as rising rents are driving young people to move </span><a href="https://www.richardnelsonllp.co.uk/record-number-young-adults-living-with-parents/"><span>back home</span></a><span>. On the other end of the spectrum, as landlords are more likely to choose </span><a href="https://www.accommodationforstudents.com/student-landlord-guides/3684"><span>couples as tenants</span></a><span>, many are delaying inevitable breakups or prematurely diving into cohabiting just to make the housing search slightly more bearable. One 2021 survey even found that </span><a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/uk/mortgages/moving-in-with-your-partner-survey/"><span>18 per cent</span></a><span> of respondents moved in with their partner mainly because it was “financially beneficial”. Who said romance was dead!</span></p>
<p><span>For Poppy*, the current crisis is acting as an incentive to get back with an ex. She split with her partner in January and has been lodging with friends ever since. “This is all I can really afford on my salary – I can’t afford to rent a one-bedroom flat in London,” Poppy, a lawyer, tells me. “I feel really unsettled.”</span></p>
<p><span>Poppy’s ex is keen for them to get back together, which is looking like an increasingly appealing offer to her. “Genuinely, a massive determining factor in me thinking that I’m probably going to do that, is just that it would be so nice to live in my own place again,” she says. “For all my possessions to not be in boxes in storage, to not be faced with the prospect of living in a tiny room in a shared house for the next few years. Which is really depressing, but it’s true.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“I assumed I would have financial independence and housing security at this point in my life” – Poppy</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>It’s jarring. You’d think that in 2022, ‘having a job’ would equal financial independence and security, but evidently this is far from the case. “I had a conversation with my boss a few months ago and she half-jokingly said I just need to meet a rich man,” Poppy says. “I was just so pissed off because it’s </span><em><span>true</span></em><span>.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The thought of needing to meet a partner in order to have any kind of housing security is so toxic but it dominates my choices around dating and thoughts about meeting anyone,” she continues. “That’s really depressing – I assumed I would have financial independence and housing security at this point in my life.”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/apr/17/one-in-three-uk-millennials-will-never-own-a-home-report"><span>O</span><span>ne in three millennials</span></a><span> will never own a home, and things aren’t looking much brighter for Gen Z either. Many of us have accepted this, and </span><a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/generational-attitudes-on-homeownership"><span>some studies</span></a><span> show that young people are increasingly ambivalent about home ownership. But this just makes it even more cruel and unjust that renting is now becoming untenable too. As Vicky Spratt, housing rights campaigner and author of </span><a href="https://profilebooks.com/work/tenants/#:~:text=Tenants%20(Hardback)amp;text=Award%2Dwinning%20housing%20journalist%20Vicky,frontline%20all%20around%20the%20country."><em><span>Tenants</span></em></a><span> told Dazed in June, we need “immediate” solutions to protect tenants </span><em><span>now</span></em><span>. “These are: regulating the private rental sector, making sure that renters have rights, that they can’t be evicted very easily, making sure that landlords have to carry out repairs, and also regulating rents,” she said.</span></p>
<p><span>You’d be forgiven for thinking that big, abstract economic circumstances have little bearing on our day-to-day lives, but the personal and the political have always been completely intertwined. This is why it’s vital we get angry, and stay angry, before government inaction and apathy encroach on our freedoms any further. Because it’s bad enough to be forced to stay in a mould-ridden one-bedroom apartment that costs over half your wage – but worse still to have to live there with a person you don’t even love anymore.</span></p>

<p><span>Do you know what we need? Another <a href="/elvis-presley">Elvis</a> biopic. Luckily, <a href="/sofia-coppola">Sofia Coppola</a> and <a href="/a24-films">A24</a> have us covered with </span><em><span>Priscilla</span></em><span>, a newly-announced film based on the 1985 memoir of </span><span>the eponymous actor, businesswoman, and former wife of the King, titled </span><em><span>Elvis and Me</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The film follows Coppola’s 2020 comedy </span><em><span>On the Rocks</span></em><span>, and was also adapted for the screen by the Oscar-winning director. The story told in </span><em><span>Elvis and Me </span></em><span>follows Priscilla Beaulieu Presley’s intimate account of her life with Elvis – who she married in 1967 – including details of their promiscuity, drug use, and the decline of their relationship leading up to their divorce in 1973.</span></p><p><span>Priscilla Presley is set to be portrayed by Cailee Spaeny (<em>Vice</em>, <em>The Craft: Legacy</em>), who has been Coppola’s first choice for the role since day one, as reported by </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2022/09/sofia-coppola-priscilla-a24-cailee-spaeny-jacob-elordi-tapped-to-play-priscilla-and-elvis-presley-1235115526/"><em><span>Deadline</span></em></a><span>. <a href="/euphoria"><em>Euphoria</em></a>’s Jacob Elordi will play Elvis, meanwhile, following Austin Butler’s </span><span>widely-praised portrayal</span><span> of the rock and roll star in Baz Luhrmann’s <a href="/fashion/article/56326/1/elvis-baz-luhrmann-biopic-austin-butler-prada-miu-miu-costume-catherine-martin">2022 biopic</a>.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Priscilla </span></em><span>will be Sofia Coppola’s third collaboration with A24, with the production company previously involved in </span><em><span>On the Rocks </span></em><span>and </span><a href="/tag/the-bling-ring"><em><span>The Bling Ring</span></em></a><span>. A television adaptation of Edith Wharton’s </span><em><span>Custom of the Country </span></em><span>is also in the works, marking the filmmaker’s first foray into episodic TV.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>A release date is yet to be set for <em>Priscilla</em>, which is scheduled to start filming in Toronto this autumn.</span></p>]]>
