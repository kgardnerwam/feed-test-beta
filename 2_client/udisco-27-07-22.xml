        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Last week, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/she-and-him-dont-worry-baby-brian-wilson/">She &amp; Him</a> </strong>released their highly anticipated album tribute to Brian Wilson, titled <strong><a href="https://found.ee/SheandHimMeltAway" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Melt Away. </em></a></strong> To celebrate, <em>uDiscoverMusic </em>and Fantasy Records have teamed up to give away a framed 12” x 12” LP sleeve for the album, signed by Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward, who make up the acclaimed duo. The contest will run through August 31.</p>
<p>She &amp; Him’s seventh studio album is a loving, LP-length tribute to one of the greatest living American songwriters and singers, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/watch-brian-wilsons-star-studded-80th-birthday-video/">Brian Wilson</a></strong>. <em>Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson</em> finds Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward diving deep into the legendary artist’s extensive songbook, offering fascinating and delectable new spins on time-honored classics and overlooked gems alike.</p>
<p>These fourteen covers are infused with the familiar magic that She &amp; Him fans know and love, opening a new window into Wilson’s iconic catalog. Wilson even features on a song with Zooey and M. Ward for the album, “Do It Again.” The band have enjoyed a friendship, and mutual appreciation, with Wilson over the years and She &amp; Him was previously a guest vocalist on his 2015 album, <em>No Pier Pressure</em>.</p>
<p>“In the spring of 2020, we started a list of our favorite Brian songs—a very long list,” the duo explains. “We chose songs without any regard to their chart performance. The obscure ones hit us just as hard as the more popular songs—and all are ripe for re-imagining, re-interpreting, and re-inventing. Brian writes songs of beauty and loneliness and vulnerability better than anyone—and by sequencing them next to popular songs of confidence and love and fun, it creates a more complete picture of life on earth.”</p>
<p>Brian Wilson also shared a comment on <em>Melt Away</em>, saying, “Zooey and Matt did such mind-blowing versions of our songs. The harmonies are beautiful and right on. I love this record!”</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>GRAMMY Award-winning guitar virtuosos <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/rodrigo-y-gabriela-metallica-struggle-within/">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a></strong> have shared an ambitious new cover version of the Radiohead classic, “Weird Fishes/Arpeggi,” available now at all DSPs and streaming services. An official visualizer also premiered today at YouTube. </p>
<p>Recorded by Rodrigo y Gabriela in their studio in Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo, Mexico, “Weird Fishes” marks the duo’s first new release since last year’s GRAMMY Award-nominated version of Metallica’s “The Struggle Within.” Additional new music will follow later this year.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/N7CDVqkIK98?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p>“When I was young, I never took a close look into Radiohead’s music,” says Rodrigo. “I was the typical metal head and the typical metal head in the 80s and 90s was pretty much a closed-minded character who rarely took a risk listening to alternative bands. It was not until we met John Leckie, who produced our first album in 2006 and Radiohead’s first two albums in the early 90s, that they got my attention.</p>
<p>“They evolved from being an Alt band, to being a cool band, to being a really interesting band – until last year while having a coffee in one of my restaurants I have in Mexico, ‘Weird Fishes’ started playing in the background. I knew it was them, but I didn’t know the song, and after I left I immediately looked it up on Spotify. As soon as I listened to it loud and clear I knew we had to make a Rodrigo y Gabriela version of it. A day or two after, I showed it to Gab and she was as hooked as I was. It’s such an intricate song if you want to play it the way they do. We were happy with the results though.”</p>
<p>Rodrigo y Gabriela are currently in the midst of a busy international live schedule, with North American dates getting underway September 14 at Carmel-by-the-Sea, CA’s Sunset Center and continuing through the month.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>In celebration of their recently announced new covers EP, <em>Fun Machine: The Sequel</em>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/lake-street-dive-announce-fun-machine-the-sequel-covers-ep/">Lake Street Dive</a></strong> have released a performance video for the EP’s first single, a fresh take on Bonnie Raitt’s “Nick of Time.”</p>
<p>In May of 2012, a largely unknown group of musicians from New England stood on a street corner in Boston, Massachusetts and performed a brilliantly syncopated, imaginative cover of the Jackson 5 classic “I Want You Back.” It went viral. Now, a full decade later, that band, Lake Street Dive, has returned to the very same spot for another enchanting live performance video—a sublime take of the aforementioned Raitt single.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WFDqa1mmzVs?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p>In a collective statement, Lake Street Dive said: “10 years ago, we set up our instruments on a Boston street corner and played one of our favorite cover songs in front of one microphone, with our buddy @10xgreg behind the camera. Very unexpectedly this simple, unadorned representation of how we make music together ended up resonating with millions of people world-wide and completely changing our lives!!! In celebration of that 10-year anniversary, we decided to go back to that same street corner and play another one of our favorite cover songs, “Nick of Time” by the one and only Bonnie Raitt! Simple, unadorned, straight from the heart! Hope you enjoy!!!”</p>
<p>For Lake Street Dive, vocalist Rachael Price; bassist/background vocalist, Bridget Kearney; drummer/background vocalist, Mike Calabrese; and keyboardist/vocalist, Akie Bermiss, the prospect of covering some of their favorite songs in the studio isn’t merely an exercise in breathless adoration. It’s an opportunity for artful re-invention, a way to acknowledge their inspirations while also advancing their own musical foundation⎯all in hopes of inspiring a new generation of fans along the way. On <em>Fun Machine: The Sequel</em>, they do just that—spinning these carefully chosen and beloved songs to new places in their own, entirely original way.</p>

                        <p>Richmond-based five-piece collective Butcher Brown share a new song "Unbelievable" from <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/butcher-brown-triple-trey-ft-tennishu-album/"><strong>their forthcoming big band album</strong></a> <em>Butcher Brown Presents Triple Trey featuring Tennishu and R4ND4ZZO BIGB4ND</em>, which is out September 16 via Concord Jazz.</p>

"Unbelievable" follows the previously released single "Liquid Light," which arrived alongside an animated video and standalone track "BLACK MAN," <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/butcher-brown-black-man-michael-millions-video/"><strong>featuring fellow Richmond rapper and songwriter Michael Millions</strong></a> which XXL included in their Best New Hip Hop Songs of the Week list. You can check the track out below.</p>
<p>Speaking of “Unbelievable”, Marcus "Tennishu" Tenney shares: "This is one of my favorites from B.I.G.‘s catalog. This record to me is an example of what makes rap music special. This beat by DJ Premier is one of the greatest beats of all time and the way that the lyrics lay inside of the sections of the beat made it lock into a classic as soon as I heard it.”</p>

<p>The new album was originally written and produced by the band's MC and multi- instrumentalist Tennishu as a hip hop album, but has since evolved into Butcher Brown's own eclectic ode to big band jazz, their first foray into this format. <em>Butcher Brown Presents Triple Trey</em> is both trail-blazing in its approach to classic jazz, bringing the band and the <em>R4ND4ZZO BIGB4ND</em> to lay down a collage of jazz suites for a hip-hop album, and simultaneously mashing together elements of the soul, funk, and rock influences that has formed the band's musical identity.</p>
<p>The band are fresh off a collaborative set with Pink Siifu at Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago earlier this month, and will be playing the sold out Blue Note Jazz Festival in Napa Valley this weekend and Afropunk Fest in Brooklyn in September.</p>
<p>Vinyl of the new project will be available on November 11 in standard black and “Opaque Blue” as a limited pressing of 2000. The 12” Vinyl includes a 7” with two bonus tracks “Guitarmy” and “Peace." The album's cover art was created by famed designer Lou Beach (designer of Weather Report's 1977 classic, Heavy Weather and Butcher Brown's most recent album #KingButch).</p>
<p>The new project marks Butcher Brown's first body of work since they graced NPR's Tiny Desk (At Home) series with a performance straight from a Richmond rooftop last year, and collaborated with Alex Isley on a cover of Patrice Rushen's "Remind Me." Following a tour run supporting Kamasi Washington in 2019, Butcher Brown released their eighth album #KingButch in 2020, which features the stand-out track "Tidal Wave," and received praise from the likes of Bandcamp, OkayPlayer and NPR, which described the album as "a great marriage of hip-hop and jazz."</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Zambian-born, Botswana-raised poet and rapper <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/sampa-the-great-denzel-curry-lane/">Sampa The Great</a></strong> has shared her newest single, “Bona”, taken from her impending sophomore full-length album <em>As Above, So Below</em>, arriving on September 9 via Loma Vista Recordings.</p>
<p>Much like its recent predecessor “Never Forget,” “Bona” takes further influence from the music Sampa heard as a child while raised in Botswana. Produced by Zambian royalty Mag44, with co-production from Sampa herself (making this her first official producer credit), the track is influenced by Kwaito and Amapiano, fusing the genres into a hybrid hip-hop blend.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYmCWEx6x8M?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p>A slowly descending swipe of chimes opens the song with ethereal beauty, before a bouncing bassline tos-and-fros setting a fiery tempo. Sampa raps utop the frenetic pace, before a dynamic and majestic chorus of call and response unfolds. A self-defined moment of Southern African Swag, Sampa’s wide-reaching message of “Bona” to be yourself and not succumb to the intimidation of others, unveils more from the narrative of her forthcoming album, <em>As Above, So Below</em>.</p>
<p>Directed by Travys Owen, the track’s experimental visualizer sees Sampa inhabiting a fluorescent dreamscape, performing whilst she flickers through a series of prismatic scenes. From immersion underwater and acceleration through frenetic flashing lights on the back of a motorcycle, to celestial choreography cocooned by an ethereal glow, the visualizer serves as an expansion of Sampa's future-forward universe - all while embodying the self-assured energy contained within "Bona".</p>
<p>Sampa says of “Bona”: I haven’t yet shown the influence Botswana has had on me musically; this is the style, language and swag of Batswana youth. “Bona” is a chance for me to shine light on other elements of music that I was influenced by when growing up, outside of Zambian music. I want to bring a Southern African anthem to the mix and DJ desks, and show that there’s an array of music coming out of Africa, on top of Afrobeats.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Pushing boundaries wasn't a producer's job when Tom Wilson got into the game in the 1950s, but he made it his priority. Early in his career, he helped <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/death-jazz-pianist-cecil-taylor/">Cecil Taylor</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/futuristic-sounds-sun-ra-60-years-reissue/">Sun Ra</a></strong> explore the outermost edges of jazz. In the mid-'60s he basically willed folk rock into being, with a bit of help from <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/bob-dylan/">Bob Dylan</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/paul-simon/">Simon &amp; Garfunkel</a></strong>, and Jim and Jean. By the late 60s he was bringing the most radical minds in rock to the fore, overseeing the first studio exploits of <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-velvet-underground/">The Velvet Underground</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/frank-zappa/">The Mothers of Invention</a></strong>, The Blues Project, and <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/best-prog-rock-songs/">Soft Machine</a></strong>. A Black man in a predominantly white rock 'n' roll world, he challenged the status quo in every way possible, birthing some of the era's most groundbreaking sounds.</p>
<p>Wilson’s life was a study in contrasts. His great aunt was a slave, but he graduated cum laude from Harvard with a degree in economics. He had a head for business and a conservative bent (he joined the Young Republicans at school and had mixed feelings about Black revolution), but he was an open-minded, artistic soul who could hang with the most forward-looking musicians on the planet.</p>
<h2>Jazz Beginnings</h2>
<p>Tom Wilson started his musical career in jazz. He inaugurated his Transition imprint in 1955, and by the following year, he’d unleashed two of the mightiest mavericks in jazz on the world at large with the debut LPs of both Sun Ra and Cecil Taylor (<em>Jazz by Sun Ra</em> and <em>Jazz Advance</em>, respectively.)</p>
<p>Ra’s astral orchestrations and Taylor’s musical cubism were still very much works in progress at the time, but they were still leagues beyond almost anything else happening in jazz. Wilson continued releasing records on Transition through 1957, but the label’s unsurprising lack of financial viability led him to seek something more remunerative. By 1959 Wilson was the jazz A&amp;R man for United Artists.</p>
<p>At UA, and subsequently at Savoy, he was able to give artists like Ra and Taylor a wider audience while they expanded their sounds on records like <strong><a href="https://found.ee/TFSOSunRa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra</em></a></strong> and Taylor’s <em>Hard Driving Jazz</em>. But in 1963 Wilson took a job as a staff producer at Columbia Records, where his focus took a drastic stylistic shift.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l6YZNpxFii8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<h2>Bob Dylan</h2>
<p>Tom Wilson was paired rather unceremoniously with the label’s new folk phenom, Bob Dylan, reportedly due to clashes between legendary producer <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-impeccable-taste-of-john-hammond-sr/">John Hammond</a></strong> and Dylan’s manager, Albert Grossman. <em>The Freewheelin’ Bob Dylan</em> was two-thirds done, but Wilson aided in its completion, delivering the first real taste of Dylan’s game-changing songwriting mastery. The young Minnesotan’s lyrical wizardry won the jazz-minded Wilson over. “I was flabbergasted,” Wilson told <em>Melody Maker</em>’s Michael Watts in 1976, “I said to Albert Grossman, who was there in the studio, I said, ‘if you put some background to this you might have a white Ray Charles with a message.’”</p>
<p>Wilson facilitated Dylan’s next several evolutionary leaps, through the social commentary of <em>The Times They Are A-Changin'</em> and the symbolism-heavy songpoetry of <em>Another Side</em>, taking an even bigger hand in the folk king’s adoption of electricity. On 1965’s <em>Bringing It All Back Home</em>, the folk-rock explosion of tracks like “Subterranean Homesick Blues” and “Maggie’s Farm” literally created a new genre, and the move was sparked by Wilson. “He brought in musicians like Bobby Gregg and Paul Griffin to play with me,” Dylan told Bill Flanagan in a Q&amp;A for BobDylan.com, “Those guys were first class, they had insight into what I was about. Most studio musicians had no idea, they hadn’t listened to folk music or blues or anything like that.”</p>
<p>Wilson duly took credit for the progression, and in a 1969 <em>Rolling Stone</em> interview with Jann Wenner, the artist essentially agreed. “He did [initiate the change] to a certain extent,” said Dylan. “That is true. He did. He had a sound in mind.” Wilson helped Dylan take that sound even further on the surrealist roadhouse rockers of <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em>. By 1966, he was caroming off those innovations to expand the folk-rock idea beyond Dylan.</p>
<h2>Simon &amp; Garfunkel / Jim and Jean</h2>
<p>Tom Wilson had brought Simon &amp; Garfunkel to Columbia and overseen their little-heard, all-acoustic debut album, <em>Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.</em> In 1966 he applied the electric treatment to that LP’s band-less “The Sound of Silence” without even informing the duo. Wilson told <em>Melody Maker</em>, “I took Dylan’s backing band and went and overdubbed it, everything, on my own, ’cause they [S&amp;G] weren’t around – they’d taken off after the record hadn’t done anything.” By the time the electrified “Sound of Silence” was released as a single, Wilson had moved to a better-paying gig at M.G.M/Verve, but he was vindicated when it went to No. 1 and led to a folk-rocking future for the pair.</p>
<p>One of Wilson’s earliest projects for Verve pushed the still-fresh rock/folk merger a step further. He brought Dylan session men like bassist Harvey Brooks, keyboardist Al Kooper, and the aforementioned drummer Bobby Gregg in to add something fresh to Greenwich Village folk duo Jim and Jean’s sound. The result was the cutting-edge album <em>Changes</em>, where Jim and Jean (who inspired the characters of the same name in the Coen Brothers film <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>) performed songs written by the cream of the burgeoning singer/songwriter movement including Phil Ochs, David Blue, and Dylan. Especially ahead of the curve were Ochs’s art-folk odysseys “The Crucifixion” and “Flower Lady,” still unrecorded by their author at the time.</p>

<h2>Tom Wilson and Frank Zappa</h2>
<p>Having made the journey from folk into rock, Tom Wilson seemed to apply the outward-bound ideas he’d championed in his jazz days to the rock realm, just as psychedelia was starting to expand the music’s possibilities. It was only natural that he’d connect with the man who would become rock’s most indefatigable avant-gardist, Frank Zappa. After catching Zappa’s band, The Mothers, performing their edgy, apocalyptic “Trouble Every Day,” Wilson was impressed enough to bring them to Verve to cut their debut album, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/frank-zappa-freak-out-feature/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Freak Out!</em></a></strong></p>
<p>Other than rechristening themselves The Mothers of Invention in accordance with Verve’s request for a name alteration, The Mothers made zero concessions to conventionality on their maiden voyage. Wilson reportedly let Zappa unleash his inner conductor and call the shots, while making sure Frank had everything he needed to realize his vision.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YD-vGafKe_4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<p>“I spent $25,000 on <em>Freak Out!</em> without telling the company anything about it,” Wilson told <em>Melody Maker</em>. “I promoted them myself. We went on a cross-country tour and sold 47,000 copies. I had to sell it or lose my job.” In <em>Hit Parader</em>, Zappa confirmed, "Wilson was sticking his neck out. He laid his job on the line by producing the album.” <em>Freak Out!</em> was probably the most radical “rock” album ever released by a major label at that point. But Zappa – never one to bestow compliments lightly – later told MTV, “Tom Wilson was a great guy. He had a fascinating ability to read <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, have a blonde sitting on his lap, and tell the engineer to add more compression to the vocal all at the same time.”</p>
<p>Tall, handsome, impeccably attired, and endlessly charismatic, Wilson was the sort for whom the term “ladies’ man” was invented. He even drove around in an Aston Martin DB4, better known to movie lovers as the original James Bond car. Eventually, even some of Wilson’s most enthusiastic boosters would complain that he devoted too much attention to his love life, to the detriment of his work.</p>
<h2>The Blues Project</h2>
<p>In 1966, however, he clearly still had the balance right. After setting Zappa loose on the world, Tom Wilson brought The Blues Project’s first studio album into being. The band’s keyboardist, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/al-kooper/"><strong>Al Kooper</strong></a>, had been in Wilson’s orbit since he invited Kooper along to a Dylan session and he ended up playing the epochal organ part on “Like a Rolling Stone.”</p>
<p>The first Blues Project album was a live recording that concentrated on the blues-rock side of their sound. But when the band hit the studio with Wilson to make <em>Projections</em>, the doors were opened wide. The jazzy simmer of the instrumental “Flute Thing,” the swirl of psychedelia and folk rock on “Steve’s Song,” and the floor-shaking R&amp;B/rock stomper “Wake Me, Shake Me” share space with the searing blues updates of “I Can’t Keep from Crying Sometimes” and “You Can’t Catch Me.” The album cemented The Blues Project’s status as one of the most exciting things coming out of New York City, at a time when the town had no shortage of electrifying acts.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXh6P2QVVks?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<h2>The Velvet Underground</h2>
<p>The most revolutionary New York band of the 60s (and maybe ever) became part of Tom Wilson’s world in 1967. He brought the Velvet Underground to Verve after they’d gotten the cold shoulder from a slew of other labels. Similar to Dylan, <strong><a href="https://udiscover.lnk.to/VA-45" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Velvet Underground’s debut album</a></strong> was mostly in the can by the time Wilson came along. Andy Warhol was the nominal producer, but Wilson brought it across the finish line.</p>
<p>Wilson oversaw the re-recording of three key songs: the drug-deal street scene “I’m Waiting for the Man,” the junkie reverie “Heroin,” and the exotic, absolutely <em>evil</em>-sounding adaptation of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s S&amp;M novel, “Venus in Furs.” Their like had never been heard before, and they still stand unparalleled more than half a century later. Wilson also aided in the realization of the shimmering, bittersweet ballad “Sunday Morning.”</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiobySgFP2s?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<p>“The band never again had as good a producer as Tom Wilson,” said <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-gift-celebrating-75-years-of-john-cales-contribution-to-music/">John Cale</a></strong> in <em>Up-Tight: The Velvet Underground Story</em>. Wilson was there from start to finish for the second VU album, <strong><a href="https://udiscover.lnk.to/The-Velvet-Underground-WhiteLight-WhiteHeat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>White Light/White Heat</em></a></strong>. In some ways the record was even more extreme than its predecessor. On “The Gift,” Cale recited a black-humored short story over an industrial meat grinder of a backing track, for a net effect as unprecedented as anything on the previous LP. And the 17-and-a-half-minute “Sister Ray” is a frenzied, delirious collision between Hubert Selby’s <em>Last Exit to Brooklyn</em>, the Velvets’ monstrous mountain of fuzz and feedback, and the kind of free-improv that Wilson’s early avant-jazz work helped make possible.</p>
<h2>Further adventures</h2>
<p>Tom Wilson brought the second Mothers album into the world too. <em>Absolutely Free</em> amplifies the wild promise of <em>Freak Out!</em> in a million directions. Nods to conventionality like blues and 50s rock influences are thrown to the winds, while acidic humor, avant-garde composition, and Dadaism get free reign. On tunes like “Plastic People” and “Status Back Baby,” Zappa goes mustache deep in vicious social satire, eviscerating the hypocrisies of the hippies right alongside the establishment. Even for the 60s, it was as far from commerciality as you could get, but Wilson apparently felt right at home – so much so that he stuck around for 1968’s even more determinedly in-your-face <em>We’re Only in It for the Money</em>.</p>
<p>Wilson’s excursions to rock’s outer limits weren’t limited to American artists. He and Animals bassist/Jimi Hendrix manager/producer Chas Chandler produced the self-titled 1968 debut of The Soft Machine. The British keyboards/bass/drums trio foreshadowed the arrival of prog and jazz-rock with a raw, post-psychedelic sound that made them the darlings of the U.K. underground and the progenitors of what became known as <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/canterbury-scene-prog/">the Canterbury sound</a></strong>, serving up ambitious art rock with a healthy side order of British whimsy.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xlhGlaAH4Q?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span></iframe></div>
<p>The M.G.M./Verve-sponsored radio show <em>The Music Factory</em>, hosted by Wilson from 1967 to 1968, gave first New York and then the nation further evidence that the label’s hotshot producer was a cutting-edge character. He chatted candidly with happening artists like Tim Buckley, The Velvets, Janis Ian, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/richie-havens/">Richie Havens</a></strong>, and The Lovin’ Spoonful as well as great, lesser-known acts like The Appletree Theater, Beacon Street Union, Bobby Callender, and Harumi. Amazingly, <strong><a href="https://www.producertomwilson.com/the-music-factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can hear the shows in full</a></strong> at producer, writer, DJ, and polymath Irwin Chusid’s exhaustively curated Tom Wilson tribute site.</p>
<h2>Mellow moods</h2>
<p>When he wasn’t enabling experimental rockers to splash their wildest dreams all over the ears of the public, Tom Wilson was helping artists with a subtler sensibility to realize their visions. <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/best-nico-songs-and-velvet-underground/">Nico</a></strong> relied on his aid in establishing her musical identity outside the Velvet Underground with her 1967 solo LP, <em>Chelsea Girl</em>. She was backed by her VU bandmates and her then-paramour Jackson Browne. Probably the most touching moment amid the record’s mix of chamber pop and spare, wiry folk-rock was Browne’s yearning “These Days,” which he would cut on his own years later.</p>
<p>Wilson had led Dion down the folk-rock path a couple of years earlier, and in 1969 he helped secure the former doo-wop star’s new identity as a contemplative troubadour with <em>Wonder Where I’m Bound</em>. Dion’s mellower mode had briefly made cash registers chime with the 1968 smash “Abraham, Martin and John” but wouldn’t prove profitable past that. Sales weren’t the priority for the producer or his artist, though.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwn8hIyiHvI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<p>The most mysterious of Wilson’s musical mates was the man behind the 1968 album <em>Harumi</em>. Next to nothing is known about Japanese singer/songwriter Harumi Ando, who crafted a double album of dreamy, delicately flowing psychedelia with Wilson’s help. Its second half consists of two heady side-long epics, one featuring stoner spoken-word narrative (in English) by Harumi and legendary New York radio personality Rosko over tabla drums and koto. The other backs Japanese narrators with a steady-choogling psych-rock jam. The album made no commercial impact but eventually became a cult favorite. Harumi was never heard of again.</p>
<h2>Who was Tom Wilson?</h2>
<p>Tom Wilson left M.G.M./Verve in 1968 to start his own production/A&amp;R company. By that time, he’d made major inroads as probably the first Black man supervising white artists at a major label. Not being particularly politicized, he kept his distance from the Black Power movement, but with his powerful personality and strong sense of self, he could become personally swept up in everyday struggles against prejudice. As the subject of a <em>New York Times Magazine</em> cover story by Ann Geracimos, he expressed his anger over the fact that, despite all his professional accomplishments, “some guy making $30 a week in the stock room gets the cab that won’t stop for me.”</p>
<p>“Tom Wilson straddled the post-war racial divide in a singular way,” says Irwin Chusid. “He was ambitious. If there was an advantage in being ‘authentically’ Black, he was a brother. If there was an advantage in being ‘inauthentically’ Black (i.e., sympathetically white), he pivoted. If it would get him a gig, a client, a paycheck, or laid, he had chameleonic superpowers. He kept people guessing. I suspect that he had, in his self-determinative way, transcended race, that ultimately he wasn’t interested in being a musical Jackie Robinson as much as he was interested in being Tom Wilson. If race was an issue, it was your issue. If color was a problem, it was your problem. If he didn’t cling to a community, not his concern. Tom had work to do, and no one – and no racial barrier – was going to get in his way.”</p>
<p>One thing’s for certain – Wilson had no time for small-mindedness of any sort. When Simon &amp; Garfunkel were starting out, for instance, they considered changing their names. “They thought, being Jewish names, the jocks might not play the record,” Wilson told <em>Melody Maker</em>. “I said to them, ‘Gentlemen, this is 1965. It’s time to stop all that.’”</p>
<p>As a producer, his approach seemed to be about keeping things on track while staying out of the way as much as possible, favoring the artist’s comfort over technical perfection. In 1964 he told <em>The New Yorker</em>’s Nat Hentoff, “You don’t think in terms of orthodox recording techniques when you’re dealing with Dylan. You have to learn to be as free on this side of the glass as he is out there.” Ann Geracimos observed, “He has the knack of building up whatever talent a group or an artist has, by sitting back and letting things happen, guiding them offhandedly.”</p>
<p>Some of Wilson’s artists have stated that women and business eventually diverted too much of his attention from the music. But when notoriously irascible artists like Dylan and Zappa have sung your praises after making multiple albums with you, that speaks volumes. So does having a respected recording artist like Marshall Crenshaw funnel his energies into making a documentary about you. Crenshaw’s been working on a Wilson film ever since being blown away by Chusid’s website.</p>
<p>“Tom Wilson is really a singular figure in popular music history who shifted the landscape in so many ways during his time,” says Crenshaw. “If you look at the bullet points of his legacy, it’s remarkable. The synergy between him and Bob Dylan – you can’t overstate how important that was to popular music in the 60s, which was a time when music really was a driver of social change. Releasing the first records by Sun Ra and Cecil Taylor on his label back in the 50s set off something that still resonates and reverberates… I think that Wilson’s agenda was to try and raise the consciousness of popular culture, and that we have to credit him in the here and now for doing that.”</p>
<p>Wilson never quit working. He died way too young, suffering a fatal heart attack at 47 in 1978. If he’d lived long enough to get old, it seems certain he’d have achieved a goal he told Ann Geracimos about in 1968, when he said he was expending all this effort “so that I can sit back in old age... remembering how little I missed.”</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>The year was 1984. Just twelve months after the release of their iconic <strong><a href="https://uDiscover.lnk.to/Metallica-KillEmAllWe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kill ’Em All</em></a></strong> album, thrash metal pioneers <a title="Metallica" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/metallica"><strong>Metallica</strong></a> had captured the attention of the world’s metal community, their faster, more aggressive approach to heavy metal injecting a new sense of excitement into the somewhat stagnant US scene of the early 80s. Picking up from where the likes of Iron Maiden and <a title="Motörhead" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/motorhead"><strong>Motörhead</strong></a> left off, the group was on the cusp of changing the blueprint of the heavy metal genre forever with their sophomore release, <em>Ride The Lightning</em>, released on July 27.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://udiscover.lnk.to/Metallica-Ride-The-Lightning-Deluxe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Listen to <em>Ride The Lightning</em> now</a>.</strong></p>
<p>Just prior to finishing a tour with UK black metal pioneers Venom in June 1982, Metallica arrived in Copenhagen to begin pre-recording rehearsals and writing material for <em>Ride The Lightning</em> in Sweet Silence Studios, with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the helm.</p>
<p>The resultant album cemented Metallica’s separation from their denim- and leather-clad peers. Clearly also step up from its predecessor in terms of production, <em>Ride The Lightning </em>evidenced a more advanced and powerful delivery which is now deemed a genre-defining cornerstone in the way that the thrash and speed metal subgenres sound today.</p>
<p>The album’s opening track, “Fight Fire With Fire,” sets the tone, its sophisticated – but nonetheless brutal – sound creating a perfectly balanced masterpiece. Abandoning the then-dominant heavy metal subject matter of demons, wizards and fantasy, <em>Ride The Lightning</em>’s lyrical content was inspired by politics, history, war, and capital punishment.</p>
<p>The latter permeates the title track, which explodes with a catchy groove-infested riff and an anthemic chorus that still rings out loud today – the work of a maturing band pushing the boundaries of heavy metal and exploring uncharted territory within the very genre they had helped create. Elsewhere, songs deal with the idea of living death through cryogenics (“Trapped Under Ice”), self-empowerment (“Escape”), and tales of Biblical prophecy (the timeless anthem “Creeping Death”).</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LfJxTlqg0U0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Without warning, the opening sequence to the thunderous, stadium-bothering third track, “For Whom The Bell Tolls,” solidifies the impact of <em>Ride The Lightning</em> as one of the group’s most iconic albums, marrying the unlikely styles of then bassist Cliff Burton’s classic rock and jazz influences with the rest of the band’s metal drive. It leads to the album’s halfway mark, which signifies the most poignant moment in Metallica’s career with the brave introduction of a thrash metal ballad, “Fade To Black,” marking yet another new approach to thrash metal. Unlike anything that had hitherto come out of the genre, the song’s slow, melodic arrangement, from its opening chords to the grandiose, heart-soaring finale, helped the band gain a new level of respect from music critics around the globe.</p>
<p>The album’s remaining tracks continue to pulse with innovation and momentum; elements of soulful beauty and depth are in abundance, not least with the use of classical guitars on the prelude to “Fight Fire With Fire,” before the brutal assault of Hetfield and Hammet’s buzz-saw guitars, accompanied by Ulrich’s machine-gun drumming. Meanwhile, closer “The Call Of Ktulu” (originally titled<em> “</em>When Hell Freezes Over”) delivers nine minutes of thunderous instrumental passages inspired by influential horror fiction writer HP Lovecraft, making it abundantly clear that death is the album’s predominant subject matter – albeit delivered it in a more subtle and understated format compared to the over-the-top imagery and graphic lyrics used by Metallica’s contemporaries.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pxx-vgB6CZs?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>With their 1983 debut having exposed the metal scene’s need for something heavier and more aggressive than what was on offer, <em>Ride The Lightning</em>’s innovations were greeted with refreshing enthusiasm by both the rock media and fans alike. A glance at the songwriting credits reveals Cliff Burton’s fundamental contribution to the group’s evolving sound: having co-written nearly three-quarters of the album alongside James and Lars, Burton was very much a catalyst in pushing the band into uncharted musical territory and breaking down the boundaries of heavy metal, one song at a time.</p>
<p>The result was an album on which each of the eight tracks were all, in their own right, cornerstones of not only thrash, but the entire heavy metal genre, proving that there was more to the music – and this band – than drinking beer and banging your head. Metallica’s ability to compose fast, crushingly heavy and complex music, loaded with an abundance of delicate, soulful, and deeply moving arrangements, dramatically separated them from the competition.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-smashing-pumpkins/" rel="noopener"><strong>Smashing Pumpkins</strong></a>’ dense, psychedelia-streaked debut, <em>Gish</em>, seemed to arrive from nowhere, but it moved around half a million copies. A dark horse of a disc, the record’s unexpected success placed the Chicago quartet in the slipstream of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/grunge-music-90s-rock/"><strong>grunge</strong></a> frontrunners <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/nirvana/"><strong>Nirvana</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/pearl-jam/"><strong>Pearl Jam</strong></a>, but it meant they were now expected to deliver great things with <em>Gish</em>’s follow-up, <em>Siamese Dream</em>.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://uDiscover.lnk.to/The-Smashing-Pumpkins-Siamese-Dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Listen to <em>Siamese Dream</em> now</a>.</strong></p>
<p>“What affected [<em>Siamese Dream</em>] was [the general feeling] that we’d better sell a lot of records,” Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan told <em>Uncut</em> in 2014. “Because you were facing a world with ‘indie’ bands selling 10 million copies. If you didn’t approximate those numbers, you were facing oblivion. I’ve never felt pressure like that in my life.”</p>
<p>Originally released through Hut/Virgin on 27 July 1993, <em>Siamese Dream</em> captured the alt.rock zeitgeist, sold over six million copies worldwide and is frequently cited as one of the decade’s key albums. Yet whether the Pumpkins would even complete the record was an issue that hung in the balance during the sessions.</p>
<p>“<em>Siamese Dream</em> was a very difficult record to make,” producer Butch Vig told PSN Europe. “It was recorded in Atlanta – we went there to get away from the media in LA and New York.</p>
<p>“Also, Billy [Corgan] and I raised the bar really high. We wanted to make a very ambitious-sounding record. It was all done on analog tape, so it was time-consuming. We were working 12 hours a day, six days a week for about three months, and for the last two months we worked seven days a week, 14 or 15 hours a day, because we were behind schedule.”</p>
<p>In addition to Vig and Corgan’s quest for perfection, inter-band tensions also simmered below the surface during the making of <em>Siamese Dream</em>. However, as Vig says, the Pumpkins eventually pulled together, “toughed it out and we made a pretty epic-sounding record”.</p>
<p>Clocking in at just over an hour, <em>Siamese Dream</em> remains a highly satisfying, multi-faceted opus which effortlessly defies the ravages of time. <em>Rolling Stone</em>’s insightful review noted that the record was “closer to progressive rock than to punk and grunge”, and its adventurous, 13-track menu took in everything from the <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-verve/"><strong>Verve</strong></a>-esque existentialism of the seven-minute ‘Hummer’ to the multi-layered jazz-grunge hybrid ‘Soma’ and the sweeping, string-enhanced ballad ‘Spaceboy’.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q-KE9lvU810?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Perhaps more pertinently, <em>Siamese Dream</em>’s inherent sense of fearlessness even spilled over into its quartet of spin-off singles, all of which still rank among Smashing Pumpkins’ most essential tracks. Corgan’s thinly-veiled attack on the state of the US music industry, ‘Cherub Rock’ (“Who wants honey as long as there’s some money?”), morphed from a sinewy, motorik groove to full-blown rawk heaviosity; ‘Rocket’ swerved from an <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/r-e-m/"><strong>R.E.M.</strong></a>-ish jangle to shoegazing bliss, and the emotive, suicide-related ‘Today’ hijacked Nirvana’s quiet-loud dynamic to devastating effect.</p>
<p>Arguably the record’s finest moment, however, was ‘Disarm’. A wracked, yet glorious ballad framed by acoustic guitar, timpani and bells, the song not only reflected the depth of Corgan and co’s ambition, but also provided Smashing Pumpkins with their major international breakthrough when it rose to No.11 on the British Top 40 in April 1994, despite only limited radio play.</p>

<p>The global rock press quickly got behind the band when <em>Siamese Dream</em> hit the racks. In the UK, <em>Select</em> declared the album to be “the most grand-scale, expansively-passionate blast of music you’ll hear this year”, while <em>NME</em> proclaimed it “a starting, deeply satisfying record”. The unanimous praise soon spread back across the Atlantic, where <em>Siamese Dream</em> debuted at No.10 on the <em>Billboard</em> 200, went on to move four million copies domestically and spurred its creators on to aim even higher with their courageous double-album <em>Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness</em>.</p>

        Why Bobbie Gentry Is So Much More Than ‘Ode To Billie Joe’

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Bobbie Gentry is a pioneering spirit. A woman in control of her music, her image, her business, she released seven albums in just five years. She was comfortable in country, pop, soul, and folk. One of the great American storytellers, her terrain was the complex relationship of class, gender, family, sexuality – all bound up in Southern myth.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://bobbiegentry.lnk.to/TGFCC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Listen to <em>The Girl From Chickasaw County</em></a>.</strong></p>
<p>Born Roberta Lee Streeter, on July 27, 1944, she gave herself the name Gentry, inspired by the title character in the 1952 film <em>Ruby Gentry</em>. In this melodrama, Ruby Gentry was a poor Southern girl and “a tramp who looks like a lady but doesn’t behave like one” – a clear early influence on Bobbie’s nascent songwriting. Bobbie, too, grew up in isolated rural poverty; she had neither electricity nor toys. Though she denied that her songs were autobiographical, she was plainly intimate with every location she sang about, and the difficult moral choices that come with never having enough to live on.</p>
<p>Bobbie loved both philosophy and showbiz; the former she studied at UCLA, and the latter she broke into through stints as a model and performer in Los Angeles nightclubs. Yet, all the while, Bobbie was developing her own vision, something that combined the everyday and the extraordinary.</p>
<h2>Leader of the pack</h2>
<p>A female singer-songwriter (which was rare enough in itself), she was unique in her narrative palate. From its title alone, “Ode To Billie Joe” – which she included on the very first demo she presented to Capitol Records, in 1967 – sounds like it’ll be a he’s-so-fine celebration of young love. Instead, Bobbie Gentry drew the listener in to an existential experience of grief. Unlike the “<a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/grave-concerns-the-everlasting-appeal-of-death-discs/"><strong>death discs</strong></a>” fad (tracks such as The Shangri-Las’ “Leader Of The Pack”), “Ode To Billie Joe” skipped over the gory drama of Billie Joe McAllister’s suicide. Instead, Bobbie focused on the silence that the community used to cope with this shocking event. Billie Joe’s death mercilessly exposed the isolation that exists between people, even within families.</p>
<p>The song was also a cracking mystery story. What in hell were the two young lovers lobbing off the Tallahassee Bridge? Pestered to reveal it in interviews, Bobbie steadfastly refused. “It’s not really important what they are throwing off the bridge,” she said. “The important thing is that people don’t really care about what happens to another person.”</p>
<p>Released in 1967, the influence of “Billie Joe” was seismic. The song itself was widely and almost immediately covered: <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/diana-ross-the-supremes/"><strong>The Supremes</strong></a>, Nancy Wilson, Tammy Wynette, and Lou Donaldson all recorded versions within a year. Jeannie C Riley’s “Harper Valley PTA,” from 1968, mined similar themes of gossip and small-town hypocrisy, and seems a direct descendent of Bobbie’s Southern-baked storytelling. The emotive songwriting of Dolly Parton was a cousin to Bobbie’s tales of dreams and destitution, as was the cheerful psychodrama of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/cher/"><strong>Cher</strong></a>’s “Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves.” The boundaries of what a successful female singer-songwriter could tackle were instantly far wider because of Bobbie’s range and skill.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7TGboqz-L88?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Bobbie Gentry herself returned to the narratives of her childhood in 1970’s “Fancy,” in which an impoverished mother grooms her daughter to be a prostitute. “‘Fancy’ is my strongest statement for women’s lib, if you really listen to it,” she has said. “I agree wholeheartedly with that movement and all the serious issues that [it stands] for – equality, equal pay, day-care centers, and abortion rights.” The song also contains one of Bobbie’s finest ever lyrics, as the scared teenager, now made-up and in a dancing dress, watches “a roach crawl across the toe of my high-healed shoe”: an image worthy of another great Southern chronicler, William Faulkner.</p>
<h2>“It’s totally my own from inception to performance”</h2>
<p>You could argue Bobbie Gentry’s music was country; you could argue she was a folkie. She could howl out swirling psychedelic swamp-rock such as “Mississippi Delta” or burble along gently on the easy-does-it ‘I’ll Never Fall In Love Again’ (her only UK No.1). There was soul; there was conceptual fancy; there was avant-garde pop. She even recorded an (unreleased) album of jazz standards. Artists the likes of <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/dusty-springfield/"><strong>Dusty Springfield</strong></a> or <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/joni-mitchell/"><strong>Joni Mitchell</strong></a> might have straddled two or three of these, but few would sound so comfortable in so many. There seemed a bravery about Bobbie Gentry, a have-a-go spirit especially unusual given the straightjacket for female artists at the time.</p>
<p>Bobbie also challenged the conventions about studio control. “I produce my own records,” she has said. “I originally produced ‘Ode To Billie Joe,’ and most of the others, but a woman doesn’t stand much chance in a recording studio. A staff producer’s name was nearly always put on the record.” Musically, the arrangements would reflect her stories; the lurching strings of “Ode To Billie Joe,” for instance, mirror the nauseous unhappiness of the narrator. Opportunities for female producers have been depressingly slow to advance (a woman has never won a Grammy for production, and only a handful of women have ever been nominated in that category), but at least Bobbie fought to have her contribution recognized. By <em>Patchwork</em>, her final album, in 1971, she was fully credited as producer.</p>
<p>Though she largely ceased recording after <em>Patchwork</em>, Bobbie Gentry wasn’t done quite yet. Interested in the presentation of her music (and a voracious fashionista too), Bobbie now went all-out with a series of Las Vegas performances, which drew from her grit’n’glamour early nightclub stints a decade earlier. “I write and arrange all the music, design the costumes, do the choreography, the whole thing – I’m completely responsible for it,” she said of her 70s shows. “It’s totally my own from inception to performance.”</p>
<h2>Her influence still courses through</h2>
<p>Standard in the music industry now, Bobbie’s show, featuring multiple costume changes, character-based song interpretations, and tightly-choreographed dancers, was one of the first of its type. She was camp and theatrical, simultaneously celebrating and mocking artificiality (her <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/elvis-presley/"><strong>Elvis</strong></a> impression impressed The King himself, who snuck into a performance one night). She earned megabucks from these shows and, in charge of her own business dealings from the very start, kept the whole lot.</p>
<p>Finally, when she didn’t want to do it all anymore, she just stopped. Her last public appearance was in 1981, and all requests for interviews, appearances, and comebacks have been flatly refused since.</p>
<p>As well as her achievements in writing, production, and performance, this Renaissance woman also achieved something more nebulous, but perhaps most significant of all. Bobbie Gentry was a persona. She was ultimately unknowable; listening closely to her music only yields more questions, fewer answers. She played with the conventions of both femininity and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/in-depth-features/americana-music-country-roots-history/"><strong>Americana</strong></a>, and her influence still courses through the shifting plains of the Mississippi Delta.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>With Netflix hit <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/metallica-stranger-things-master-of-puppets/"><em><strong>Stranger Things</strong></em></a> providing the title track of Metallica's <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/metallica-master-of-puppets-album/"><strong>landmark 1986 album</strong></a> <em>Master Of Puppets</em> with an unexpected boost, the band have seized the opportunity to give the song something it never had: a video.</p>
<p>The new animated lyric video was made by UK design agency ILoveDust, who also worked with Ozzy Osbourne on the artwork for his upcoming studio album Patient Number 9, and with Foo Fighters on promotional activity for their <em>Studio 666</em> movie. You can check it out below.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xjJ2XIbGRk?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video" name="YouTube Embed"></iframe></div>
<p>“Master Of Puppets” renewed popularity is down to a now-iconic scene in the season 4 finale of <em>Stranger Things,</em> in which metalhead character Eddie Munsun – played by actor Joseph Quinn – shreds his way through the song in a bid to help defeat a particularly nasty demon named Vecna.</p>
<p>The scene set social media alight, with everyone from diehard <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/metallica/"><strong>Metallica</strong></a> fans to those just discovering the band excited by the song's inclusion. Metallica themselves released a video that showed them playing along with the action.</p>
<p>"Master Of Puppets" appearance in <em>Stranger Things</em> proved so popular that the track entered the UK and US charts for the first time, less than a month after Kate Bush scored a UK No.1 with the 37-year-old "Running Up That Hill" on the back of its appearance in the series.</p>
<p>Metallica have commented on the song's success, taking to Instagram to say "The way The Duffer Brothers [the show's directors] have incorporated music into <em>Stranger Things</em> has always been next level, so we were beyond psyched for them to not only include "Master Of Puppets" in the show, but to have such a pivotal scene built around it.</p>
<p>"We were all stoked to see the final result and when we did we were totally blown away... it’s so extremely well done, so much so, that some folks were able to guess the song just by seeing a few seconds of Joseph Quinn’s hands in the trailer! How crazy cool is that?"</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>On July 27, 1940, a 24-year-old <strong><a title="Frank Sinatra" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/frank-sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> </strong>created a first, in a career that would be full of them. “I'll Never Smile Again,” the 78rpm release by the hugely popular trombonist and bandleader Tommy Dorsey, with lead vocals by Sinatra, became the first No.1 on <em>Billboard</em>'s new Best-Selling Retail Records chart.</p>
<h2>A Billboard first</h2>
<p>Launched in that week's issue of the trade magazine, it was the first-ever independent national record survey to be published, polling retailers all over the country. Prior to this, <em>Billboard</em>'s popularity charts had been based on bestselling sheet music, most-played songs in jukeboxes and, in terms of airplay, a small survey of New York radio stations.</p>
<p>“I'll Never Smile Again” was composed by Canadian songwriter Ruth Lowe in sad circumstances, after her husband died during surgery. The first public performance of the song was by Lowe's countryman and bandleader Percy Faith, in 1939, before the Dorsey version, featuring Sinatra and the Pied Pipers, became the first to be released, in June 1940.</p>
<p>It entered the chart at the end of that month and claimed that historic top spot on the new <em>Billboard</em> countdown. The song stayed at the summit for no fewer than 12 weeks, before it was replaced by Bing Crosby's “Only Forever.” The success of “I'll Never Smile Again” was a key factor in Sinatra's decision to go solo in 1942; before that year was out, he had started his own classic catalogue of hits with “Night and Day” and “All Or Nothing At All.”</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EeFifLbbhcU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Sinatra re-recorded “I'll Never Smile Again” for the <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/frank-sinatra-man-and-his-music-tv-special/"><strong>1965 double LP</strong></a> <em>A Man and his Music, which marked his 50th birthday. </em>He looked back over his career to date with primarily recent, Reprise-era versions of landmark songs, remaking three especially for the release, including this one. He introduced it with the words “1940, and break number two. I was now a singing employee of Tommy Dorsey.”</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>There was no stopping Philadelphia soul hitmakers the Stylistics in the mid-1970s. By then, they had scored a remarkable ten consecutive American Top 10 R&amp;B hits in three and a half years, and five that had crossed over to the same echelon of the US pop chart in the previous two and a half.</p>

<p>1974 had already been a glorious year for the quintet, with <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/stylistics-rockin-roll-baby-song/"><strong>“Rockin’ Roll Baby”</strong></a> and “You Make Me Feel Brand New” making No.3 and No.5 respectively on the soul survey, as well as hitting the UK Top 10. “Brand New,” indeed, was racing up the British charts that July on its way to a No.2 peak, held off the top only by another Philly soul gem, the Three Degrees’ “When Will I See You Again.”</p>
<h2>A dream teaming with Peretti and Creatore</h2>
<p>Now, in the US, it was time for another anthemic ballad. On July 27, 1974, the Stylistics debuted on both the pop and soul charts with <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1BVx90BJnYDID6URI37SIy?si=zYDhXRcHQo-45kR2AzTSBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>“Let’s Put It All Together,”</strong></a> written by their producers Hugo &amp; Luigi, the New York-based cousins Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore, with George David Weiss.</p>
<p>The album of the same name had been released in May, alongside its first single “You Make Me Feel Brand New,” which oddly was appearing on its second Stylistics album in a row. It had featured in a longer version on late 1973’s <i>Rockin’ Roll Baby </i>set.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/udiscover/playlist/0X9FEKhRxTHRdhpAqJqiVs?si=gH0EM1dlSEe43fh_pWCH6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greatest Soul 45s</a> playlist.</strong></p>
<p>“Let’s Put It All Together” debuted confidently on Hot Soul Singles at No.74 and No.77 on the Hot 100, as the parent LP climbed 5-4 on the R&amp;B album chart. The single went on to become yet another Top 10 soul smash for the stylish fivesome, reaching No.8, and hit a more than respectable No.18 pop. In October, it started its transatlantic progress, becoming their third UK top tenner of the year at No.9. 1974 was proving to be a memorable year for the Stylistics.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>'The hit record on which the voice of <a title="Barry White" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/barry-white"><strong>Barry White</strong></a> made its chart debut became a gold record in July, 1972. But, before we got to know his honeyed vocals as a frontman, this time he was on the telephone with Love Unlimited.</p>
<p>That group’s Uni Records single <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/60xl1HLLbfAGpSZXAuRPoe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>“Walkin’ In The Rain With The One I Love”</strong></a> was, effectively, a prototype for White’s own huge solo success that was soon to follow. But here, he was the voice on the line, calling his baby before they walk between the raindrops in celebration of their love.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ujNafBLVD4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>There was real romance in the air, too. The three-girl group from San Pedro, California, included sisters Glodean and Linda James, with their cousin Diane Taylor. White also managed the group, and in 1974, Glodean and Barry were married.</p>
<h2>Supremely soulful</h2>
<p>Any resemblance between Love Unlimited and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/diana-ross-the-supremes/"><strong>the Supremes</strong></a> is unlikely to have been a complete coincidence. They sang on this first hit to be written and produced by White, and arranged by him with his soon-to-be-regular collaborator Gene Page.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the best of Barry White on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/barry-white-essentials/pl.48ae60d3987040eba5271ac86a6da637?itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ct=playlists_barry_white_essentials&amp;app=music&amp;ls=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/barrywhiteofficial/playlist/0bS75ioaAbvva8cOdCcvkN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify.</a></strong></p>
<p>The single – which, as you can see from the original sleeve at the top of the story, was initially advertised to record buyers as ‘…With The One <em>You</em> Love’ – made the US R&amp;B chart in late March, 1972. It rose to No.6 in a 14-week run and made No.14 on the pop chart.</p>
<p>In July, the song also peaked at No.14 in the UK, in the same week it was certified gold by the RIAA in America. In those days, that signified not 500,000 sales, but one million. Love Unlimited had further hits, alongside White’s solo popularity, until Taylor’s sad death in 1975, and also lent their name to Barry’s Love Unlimited Orchestra.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>The long chart career of <a title="The Beach Boys" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-beach-boys"><strong>the Beach Boys</strong></a> has included several singles that weren’t hits at home, but became big successes with their huge and loyal audience in Great Britain. 1967’s “Then I Kissed Her,” “Cottonfields” (1970) and 1979’s “Lady Lynda” were all substantial Top 10 singles in the UK that missed the US countdown altogether.</p>
<p>Several other Beach Boys singles were much better liked by British fans than by their American counterparts. On July 27, 1968, the group entered the US chart at No.88 with “Do It Again,” a new single from the hit album they’d released <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-beach-boys-2020-album/"><strong>earlier that year</strong></a>, <em>20/20</em>. It made reasonable progress throughout August, but maybe it was the slightly more progressive, throbbing beat of the Brian Wilson-Mike Love composition that hampered its progress in America.</p>
<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LkgyvWSlcM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" class="uD-YT-video"></iframe></div>
<p>Nevertheless, “Do It Again” had the familiar soaring harmonies that had long been the group’s trademark, not to mention a lyric with a nostalgic nod to their original inspirations. “Well I’ve been thinking ’bout all the places we’ve surfed and danced and all the faces we’ve missed,” sang Love, “so let’s get back together and do it again.” Their British admirers loved it.</p>
<h2>Even better vibrations</h2>
<p>So it was that while “Do It Again” stopped at No.20 on the <em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 in September, by then it had done something only <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/beach-boys-good-vibrations/"><strong>“Good Vibrations”</strong></a> had done before it for the Beach Boys, spending a week as the UK’s No.1 single. It was a remarkable new success, especially as Bruce Johnston told the <em>NME</em>’s end-of-year annual edition that the song didn’t represent the Beach Boys’ musical direction of the time at all.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the best of the Beach Boys on <a href="https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/the-beach-boys-essentials/pl.3624224cfea3405cb5923f5e816a7311?itsct=music_box_link&amp;itscg=30200&amp;ct=playlists_the_beach_boys_essentials&amp;app=music&amp;ls=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/thebeachboysofficial/playlist/68lfNXU4hCEfJnoyclNEH7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify.</a></strong></p>
<p>“It was really just a time-trick!” he laughed. “Everyone else was going back to the basics at that time. <a title="The Rolling Stones" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-rolling-stones"><strong>The Stones</strong></a> were playing in their old style with ‘Jumping Jack Flash’ and <a title="The Beatles" href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-beatles"><strong>The Beatles</strong></a> came up with a kind of mock-rock, <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/the-beatles-record-lady-madonna-in-a-rush/"><strong>‘Lady Madonna.’</strong></a> We decided to follow the general pattern with some pseudo surfing. It wasn't really serious and [was] never intended to indicate our present musical development."</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/she-him-fall-tour/">Zooey Deschanel (She) &amp; M. Ward (Him)</a></strong> have released an animated lyric video for “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” a track from their newly released album <em>Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson</em>. The video reimagines the duo in paper doll form—accompanied by a slew of singing animals.</p>
<p>The album features singles like “Don’t Worry Baby,” which appeared on <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-beach-boys/">The Beach Boys’</a></strong> March 1964 album <em>Shut Down Volume 2</em>. Written by Brian Wilson and Roger Christian, Wilson’s lead vocal on the track is considered one of his defining performances, and he later referred to “Don’t Worry Baby” as perhaps the Beach Boys’ finest record. “Darlin’,” “Wouldn’t It Be Nice,” and “Til I I Die” were the first three singles to be released from <em>Melt Away</em>.</p>
<div class='uD-YT-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/=o83S7G-UBow?rel=0' name='YouTube Embed' title='YouTube Embed' frameborder='0' allow='accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture' allowfullscreen class='uD-YT-video'></iframe></div>
<p>“‘Don’t Worry Baby’ is one of the greatest songs of all time. As with all the other songs on our tribute record, we had no interest in copycatting the original production—our version began with stripping the song down to just vocals and a drop-tuned acoustic guitar and building from there,” explained the duo about the track.</p>
<p>“The inspiration for our version comes from a lot of different places but the biggest ones would be some of Chet Atkins guitar ideas, some drum ideas from Mick Fleetwood, and some synth inventions by Dave Smith (RIP).”</p>
<p>She &amp; Him’s seventh studio album is a loving, LP-length tribute to one of the greatest living American songwriters and singers, Brian Wilson. <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/she-and-him-darlin-cover-brian-wilson-tribute/"><em>Melt Away: A Tribute to Brian Wilson</em></a></strong> finds Zooey Deschanel and M. Ward diving deep into the legendary artist’s extensive songbook, offering fascinating and delectable new spins on time-honored classics and overlooked gems alike.</p>
<p>These fourteen covers are infused with the familiar magic that She &amp; Him fans know and love, opening a new window into Wilson’s iconic catalog. Wilson even features on a song with Zooey and M. Ward for the album, “Do It Again.” The band have enjoyed a friendship, and mutual appreciation, with Wilson over the years and She &amp; Him was previously a guest vocalist on his 2015 album, <em>No Pier Pressure</em>.</p>

        <![CDATA[
                        <p>Virgin Records Germany and Universal Music Netherlands have announced the signing of <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/titanium-david-guetta-sia-dance-anthem/">DJ Afrojack</a></strong>, under a new partnership between the two labels.</p>
<p>The signing of Afrojack and his label, Wall Recordings, marks the first collaborative signing under Universal Music central Europe’s newly launched dance and electronic music hub, which was set up to provide support and amplify success for independent electronic artists and labels within central Europe. </p>
<p>Universal Music Central Europe aims to serve some of the world’s biggest pop music markets throughout central Europe, including Germany, Sweden, Italy, and the Netherlands, to create a new and dedicated international focus with global ambitions for new artist partners. The dance hub team will identify artists across Europe and beyond that might benefit from the support of this new division.</p>
<p>The first single, “Day & Night,” by Afrojack and Black V-Neck ft. Muni Long will be released on August 12. </p>
<p>Max Paproth, vice president A&R Central Europe & International Marketing Germany, said: “The new hub is exclusively dedicated to dance and electronic artists in Central Europe. We’re joining forces here and enhancing our international approach. This helps us act faster and offer dance artists a European platform from the moment they sign with us. I’m delighted to be celebrating such an incredible debut with Afrojack.”</p>
<p>Afrojack said: “I’m very excited to have partnered up with Universal for all Afrojack Music and Wall, we have big plans for the future!”</p>
<p>Kees van der Hoeven, CEO Universal Music Benelux, added: “I’m overjoyed to be able to welcome Afrojack back to the label. Especially as we’re now working with him as part of a new international setup that will allow us to offer our artists even better service and more opportunities. Afrojack is a brilliant artist and an incredible addition to our roster. I can’t wait to start working with him again.”</p>

                        <p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/ringo-starr/">Ringo Starr</a></strong> has shared a short video giving fans a glimpse into his special Peace &amp; Love birthday celebrations, which marked the legendary musician turning 82 earlier this month (July 7).</p>
<p>The Beatles drummer and All Starr Band leader held a party in Los Angeles to mark his birthday, with guests including his current All Starrs Steve Lukather, Edgar Winter, Colin Hay, Warren Ham, and Gregg Bissonette, as well as friends Benmont Tench, Jim Keltner, Richard Marx, Matt Sorum, Ed Begley Jr, Linda Perry, Diane Warren, Roy Jr, and Alex Orbison.</p>
<p>At the event, Starr helped launch a special message of “peace and love” into outer space via the Artemis Music Space Network and International Space Station. The message was comprised of his 2021 singe “Let’s Change The World” and Starr’s own “Star Song,” which is made up of the music the stars made upon his birth, as mapped out by Artemis.</p>
<p>The data was sent into orbit and circled Earth, beaming its positive messages down to the countries it passed over as well as to stars far out in the universe.</p>

<p>“We’ve been doing this now for 14 years and we started in Chicago with 100 people, and now we’re in 30 countries,” Starr said of the annual Peace &amp; Love event. “They’ve celebrated already – we started in Australia and work our way to LA. It’s so nice to see so many people here today.</p>
<p>“I only wanted to be a musician from when I was 13. It really paid off,” he added with a laugh.</p>
<p>Performances on the day came from musicians including Langhorne Slim and Sawyer Fredericks, who played a selection of some of Starr’s music from across his catalog. Meanwhile, fans from across the globe took part in the celebrations, sending in videos from the likes of Tokyo, Moscow, Venice, New York, El Salvador, Guatemala City, and many more. It was also the first time a Peace &amp; Love celebration was held in South Africa, with fans gathering in Yeoville, Johannesburg.</p>
<p>On Starr’s birthday, the legendary musician was the recipient of many special birthday wishes, including from his Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney. The Beatles’ social media pages also <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/ringo-starr-birthday/">commemorated the big day with a great video compilation</a></strong> showing clips of Starr in various Beatles projects over the years, alongside McCartney, John Lennon, and George Harrison.</p>
