It does not help that star LeBron James has been out since Nov. 2 <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/08/lebron-james-injury-timeline-lakers-4-8-weeks/">due to an abdominal strain</a>.

After many candidates were either declined the chance to interview by their respective teams or turned down the opportunity themselves, the Mets pivoted to finding a general manager.

After going 332-376 in his tenure, Eppler was fired at the conclusion of the 2020 truncated season.</p><p>Now back in New York, Eppler will reportedly be in control of baseball operations and have the final say on baseball manners, <a href="https://twitter.com/martinonyc/status/1460418872943812614?s=21">per SNY&#x2019;s Andy Martino</a>.</p><p>Once the deal is completed, Eppler will be in charge of finding the Mets&#x2019; next manager, a role vacated after the team parted ways with Luis Rojas at the end of this past season.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="{&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;dark&quot;}" data-text="Yankees make free agent push to steal Freddie Freeman from Braves" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/15/freddie-freeman-yankees-rumors-free-agency/" data-call-to-action="Next"> <div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background: #58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/15/freddie-freeman-yankees-rumors-free-agency/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span> Yankees make free agent push to steal Freddie Freeman from Braves </a> </div></div> ]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Randy Arozarena won the AL Rookie of the Year award. But did the Boston Red Sox get robbed of it?</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">With MLB in full offseason mode, that means there will be awards handed out in the midst of free agency. The Gold Glove winners were revealed this past week, in addition to the Platinum Glove winners. Now, it was time for the Rookie of the Year awards.</p><p>The AL Rookie of the Year award winner was Tampa Bay Rays outfielder Randy Arozarena. The outfielder recorded a .274 batting average, an .815 OPS, 20 home runs, 69 RBI, 145 hits and 20 stolen bases in 141 games. Arozarena received 22 first-place votes and received 124 total points.</p><p>One thing that did stand out is that not a single Red Sox rookie received a vote at the year-end awards.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Did Red Sox rookies get robbed of AL Rookie of the Year award?</h2><p>Here is how the AL Rookie of the Year award votes were tabulated, <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/2021-mlb-rookie-of-the-year-voting-results">via MLB.com</a>:</p><ul><li>Randy Arozarena, TB: 22 (first-place votes), 4 (2nd), 2 (3rd) &#x2014; 124 points</li><li>Luis Garcia, HOU: 2 (1st), 15 (2nd), 8 (3rd) &#x2014; 63 points</li><li>Wander Franco, TB: 2 (1st), 5 (2nd), 5 (3rd) &#x2014; 30 points</li><li>Adolis Garc&#xED;a, TEX: 3 (1st), 1 (2nd), 9 (3rd) &#x2014; 27 points</li><li>Emmanuel Clase, CLE: 1 (1st), 2 (2nd) &#x2014; 11 points</li><li>Ryan Mountcastle, BAL: 2 (2nd), 4 (3rd) &#x2013;10 points</li><li>Shane McClanahan, TB: 1 (2nd) &#x2014; 3 points</li><li>Alek Manoah, TOR: 2 (3rd) &#x2014; 2 points</li></ul><p>The Red Sox saw the rise of three young players who could be the future of the organization. Of course, those individuals are first baseman Bobby Dalbec and right-handed pitchers Garrett Whitlock and Tanner Houck. All three were <a href="https://bosoxinjection.com/2021/10/13/3-red-sox-prospects-make-mlbs-2021-all-rookie-team/">named to the All-Rookie Team this year</a>, and did not receive a single vote.</p><p></p><p>In 46 games, Whitlock recorded a 1.96 ERA, a 1.105 WHIP, an 8-4 win-loss record and 81 strikeouts over 73.1 innings of work.</p><p>Dalbec played in 133 games for Boston this season, where he slashed .240/.298/.494 while posting 25 home runs, 78 RBI and 100 hits.</p><p>Houck owned a 3.52 ERA, a 1.130 WHIP and 87 strikeouts over 69.0 innings of work (18 games).</p><p>Should any of these players have won the AL Rookie of the Year? No. But, an argument can definitely be made that the Red Sox should have received more love in terms of votes from members of the Baseball Writer&#x2019;s Association of America.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="{&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;dark&quot;}" data-text="Red Sox favored to land Kyle Schwarber for obvious reason" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/15/red-sox-news-kyle-schwarber-favorites/" data-call-to-action="Next"> <div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background: #58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/15/red-sox-news-kyle-schwarber-favorites/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span> Red Sox favored to land Kyle Schwarber for obvious reason </a> </div></div> ]]></content:encoded>

Since signing with Bellator, Justino has finished all three of her opponents. Justino will have to bring her best to get another finish because Kavanagh is as tough as they come. With the opportunity of a lifetime for Kavanagh, you can ensure she will do whatever it takes to win.</p><p>In the co-headliner, Tyrell Fortune and Linton Vassell have the opportunity to climb up the heavyweight rankings.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>With enticing free agent Odell Beckham Jr. now signing to NFC West rival the Los Angeles Rams, the Seattle Seahawks need to make moves to combat L.A.</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">When the <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/seattle-seahawks/">Los Angeles Rams</a> stole away Odell Beckham Jr. from the league, the hope of an uplifted offense went with him.</p><p>That&#x2019;s true for several teams who were reportedly courting the eight-year veteran, including the Seattle Seahawks, whose roster gets real thin after D.K. Metcalf and Tyler Lockett.</p><p>Beyond their starting three wideouts, which include Metcalf, Lockett and Freddie Swain, the Seahawks only have one healthy wide receiver on their roster: Penny Hart.</p><p></p><p>Dee Eskridge and John Ursua are on IR, making their wide receiver situation perilous should the team sustain even one more injury.</p><p>With the trade deadline passing on Nov. 2, all the Seahawks can do is add available players in free agency or upgrade players from their practice squad.</p><p>Here are three possible moves the Seahawks can make to bolster their offense and rival the Rams.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">3. Sign Dez Bryant</h2><p>After an impressive comeback season with the Baltimore Ravens in 2020, Dez Bryant remains an <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/top-2021-nfl-free-agents-each-position/">NFL free agent in 2021</a>.</p><p>It remains unclear what Bryant&#x2019;s exact situation is at the moment aside from investing in NFTs, but as of February of this year, Bryant said <a href="https://www.nj.com/giants/2021/02/nfl-rumors-ex-cowboys-wr-dez-bryant-has-no-plans-to-retire-after-comeback-with-ravens.html#:~:text=Giants-,NFL%20rumors%3A%20Ex%2DCowboys%20WR%20Dez%20Bryant%20has%20no%20plans,retire%20after%20comeback%20with%20Ravens&amp;text=The%20Dez%20Bryant%20comeback%20tour,missing%20the%20previous%20two%20seasons.">he has no plans to retire</a>. If available, the Seahawks could work out the 33-year-old veteran who made his name as a longtime Dallas Cowboy.</p><p>At the very least, the Seahawks could work out Bryant to see what they&#x2019;re working with and determine whether or not he&#x2019;s a fit for their offense.</p><h2>2. Sign Golden Tate</h2><p>It&#x2019;s easy to make a case for Golden Tate, who began his career with the Seattle Seahawks and won a ring with the team in 2013.</p><p>Tate, who is also 33, remains an available free agent like Bryant. As of June 2021, Tate discussed <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/golden-tate-free-agent-wr-wish-list-titans-colts-rams#:~:text=%EF%BB%BFGolden%20Tate%EF%BB%BF%20remains,388%20yards%20and%20two%20TDs.">which teams he&#x2019;d like to sign with</a>.</p><p>But Tate was also on an NFL team last season, so barring any injury or decline in athleticism, his skill set could be greatly utilized on the Seahawks a decade after he first joined the team.</p><p>Tate can be signed for depth, or to compliment Lockett and Metcalf on the field.</p><h2>1. Upgrade Cody Thompson</h2><p>If the Seahawks want to keep things in-house, they could always upgrade a player from the practice squad. They did it earlier this year when they signed Penny Hart from the practice squad to the 53-man roster, and Hart is the only backup wide receiver on the roster who isn&#x2019;t on IR.</p><p>While Thompson has never made an active NFL roster, he has been on a practice squad since he joined the league in 2019. Thompson began with the Chiefs, then the Bengals, before finishing his rookie season with the Seahawks.</p><p>Thompson put together &#x201C;<a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/gm-report/seahawks-90-man-roster-primer-cody-thompson">an impressive training camp last July</a>&#x201C;, but high competition for few wide receiver spots has&#xA0; kept Thompson off the roster.</p><p>But if Ursua and Eskridge are unable to join this season, it may be time for Seattle to turn back to their practice squad and upgrade Thompson.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="{&quot;theme&quot;:&quot;light&quot;}" data-text="D.K.
