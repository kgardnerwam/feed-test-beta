          <em>
            <strong>Odell Beckham Jr. is one of the most intriguing NFL players available right now and will choose between the Saints, Chiefs and Packers, according to Dianna Russini.</strong>
          </em>
        </p>
        <p class="speakable-content">After
          <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/09/odell-beckham-jr-free-agent-clears-waivers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">officially clearing waivers</a>
          and becoming a free agent for the first time in his career on Tuesday, Odell Beckham Jr. apparently has a few teams which he&#x2019;s &#x201C;honing in on,&#x201D; according to ESPN&#x2019;s&#xA0;Dianna Russini.</p>
        <p>Russini said sources indicated that Beckham is most interested in signing with the Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packer, and New Orleans Saints.</p>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>It&#x2019;s hard to fault him for being interested in those three franchises, especially the Chiefs and Packers who have aspirations of winning the Super Bowl. The Saints previously kicked around the idea of trading for Beckham ahead of the trade
          deadline last week.</p>
        <h2 class="speakable-content">Will Odell Beckham Jr. sign with the Kansas City Chiefs, Green Bay Packers, or the New Orleans Saints?</h2>
        <p>Any of the three teams could potentially be pretty good fits for Beckham. All three feature fun offenses that involve throwing the ball relatively frequently. All three have a need for another talented wide receiver on their roster, such as Beckham.</p>
        <p>With adding Beckham to the roster, any of these three teams would definitely increase their odds to make it to the Super Bowl.</p>
        <p>The
          <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/kansas-city-chiefs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chiefs</a>
          have been going through an uncharacteristically rough season as Patrick Mahomes has struggled to be consistent and Kansas City&#x2019;s defense has been gashed seemingly each and every week. Getting Beckham on the roster would open up Kansas
          City&#x2019;s offense and potentially make life considerably easier for Mahomes.</p>
        <p>Up in
          <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/green-bay-packers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Bay</a>, the Packers are working on navigating an odd and frustrating situation off the field with
          <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/09/aaron-rodgers-misleads-vaccination-status-packers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aaron Rodgers</a>. But if they&#x2019;re ever able to get that wrapped up and can avoid any other controversies, their offense would be entertaining to watch with one of the most talented quarterbacks in NFL history throwing the ball to a dynamic receiving threat.</p>
        <p>And of course, the
          <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/new-orleans-saints/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Saints</a>
          could use some major help on offense after losing
          <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/07/saints-trade-quarterback-jameis-winston/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jameis Winston to an injury</a>. The addition of any talented pass-catcher would be beneficial for New Orleans, but someone like Beckham would be an absolute game-changer for them.</p>

        <em>
          <strong>Mike Tomlin has the Steelers in the throes of the AFC Playoff hunt, which might be his strongest performance yet, plus, players on the cusp of breaking out in NFL&#x2019;s second half, more</strong>
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="speakable-content">It&#x2019;s high time to put some respect on Mike Tomlin&#x2019;s name.</p>
      <p>Two weeks ago, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin bristled when asked about his name being linked to the USC head coaching vacancy, pushing back on the media for even asking why he would consider the job.</p>
      <p>&#x201C;Never say never, but never,&#x201D; Tomlin told reporters. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s not a booster with a big enough blank check &#x2026; [Is] anybody asking Sean Payton about that? Anybody asking Andy Reid about stuff like that?&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Why mention Reid and Payton by name? They&#x2019;re considered around the league &#x201C;elite coaches.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>With a 5-3 start following an offseason of subtractions rather than additions, it&#x2019;s time to put Tomlin in that same tier until further notice.</p>
      <p>There are probably myriad reasons why Reid wouldn&#x2019;t leave Patrick Mahomes and what he&#x2019;s helped build in Kansas City. The same goes for Payton, who looks ahead to the rebuild at the quarterback position that the Saints are about to
        undertake.</p>
      <p>Tomlin underwent an overhaul with his coordinator and offensive line this offseason. He watched several players leave via free agency. Yet, somehow, the Steelers win.</p>
      <p>USC is a prime job in the college football ranks. It&#x2019;s why the Trojans&#x2019; Mike Bohn should be on the phone with him. It&#x2019;s also why it&#x2019;s long past time to consider him one of the greatest coaches in the modern history of
        the game.</p>
      <p>Following Monday night&#x2019;s 29-27 hang-on-by-the-skin-of-your-teeth Steelers win over the Bears, Tomlin has Pittsburgh currently as the AFC&#x2019;s No. 6 seed amid the kind of season that has come to define his tenure in the Steel City.</p>
      <p>Since becoming the Steelers&#x2019; head coach in 2007, Tomlin has&#xA0;never&#xA0;suffered a losing season. He currently owns a career 150-81-1 record and has as many Super Bowl rings as Payton and Reid do. He also has consistently filled his
        locker room with players who will run through a proverbial wall for him.</p>
      <p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s about his honesty [with Tomlin,]&#x201D; Steelers wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud told me&#xA0;<a href="https://omny.fm/shows/stacking-the-box-an-nfl-podcast/matt-lombardo-show-predicting-odell-beckhams-landi">during a recent appearance on FanSided&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>The Matt Lombardo Show&#xA0;</em>podcast</a>.&#x201C;Theway he&#x2019;s up front about everything. He&#x2019;s very direct. Never leaves anything off the table. A coach like that, even at times if you don&#x2019;t like him, you have to love him. That&#x2019;s what you want as a head coach.That&#x2019;show you keep the elephants out of the room. That&#x2019;s how you play free. That&#x2019;s how you play with a free mind, free space, free spirit.</p>
      <p>&#x201C;A coach like that, you always run through a wall for. The culture of the Steelers just makes teams so much closer. Even when we were struggling the first four games, going 1-4 the first month of the season, Coach Tomlin never changed the
        way he coached. We were doing the same thing we were doing now, just staying consistent, finding the things we needed to work on. That&#x2019;s what it was. We&#x2019;re finally clicking as a team.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>This season, Tomlin is winning on the backs of a pair of draft picks who look the part of franchise cornerstones, for a franchise that proudly displays four Vince Lombardi Trophies and has won over the span of five decades with a clear formula;
        dominant defense, run the football when the Western Pennsylvania weather turns, and maintain organizational consistency.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, rookie tight end Pat Freiermuth caught the third and fourth touchdowns of his young career from 39-year-old quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, pulling to within three scores for the lead among NFL rookies.</p>
      <p>&#x201C;Pat is football smart,&#x201D; Freiermuth&#x2019;s college head coach, Penn State&#x2019;s James Franklin tells FanSided. &#x201C;He understands concepts, doesn&#x2019;t like football but&#xA0;loves&#xA0;football. He has natural
        ball-skills, great body control, is a loose and fluid athlete who is quarterback friendly and understands how to get open.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>It&#x2019;s obvious that Freiermuth&#x2019;s natural traits are shining through, but also impossible to ignore the impact Tomlin has had on the Steelers&#x2019; latest second-round success story. Especially when considering that No. 3 overall
        pick, and fellow tight end, Kyle Pitts is in an unbelievably favorable position catching passes from a resurgent Matt Ryan but has three fewer touchdowns than Freiermuth.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the only player the Steelers chose before Freiermuth this spring, running back Najee Harris out of Alabama, already looks like one of the premier players at his position across the NFL.</p>
      <p>Harris is averaging 3.6 yards per carry and has scored four touchdowns, and just might be the most complete back the Steelers have had since Le&#x2019;Veon Bell and maybe the most explosive since Willie Parker.</p>
      <p>&#x201C;The thing about Najee is he has size,&#x201D; an NFC south personnel executive tells FanSided. &#x201C;He&#x2019;s patient as a runner, but has sneaky burst, runs with power but also has finesse in his toolbox. He also has really good ball
        skills, and offensive lineman absolutely love blocking for him, too.&#x201D;</p>
      <p>Freiermuth and Harris&#x2019; instant success are key attributable to Tomlin&#x2019;s influence, system, and coaching. They also embody the Steelers&#x2019; historical dominance of the NFL Draft under the direction of general manager Kevin
        Colbert. Harris, Freiermuth, Freiermuth continue to follow in the footsteps of the likes of Chase Claypool, Devin Bush, Terrell Edmunds, James Washington, T.J. Watt, and JuJu Smith-Schuster who were added in the first two rounds dating back to the
        2017 draft.</p>
      <p>Mid-round picks such as Kendrick Green and Dan Moore have found similar success to that of Dionte Johnson, Alex Highsmith, and Cam Sutton.</p>
      <p>That&#x2019;s the Steelers&#x2019; blueprint. Build through the draft, and allow Tomlin to develop those picks into elite players.</p>
      <p>Tomlin clearly has the faith, trust, and belief of the Steelers, who have had three head coaches since Chuck Noll was hired in 1969. Tomlin also has a better winning percentage (.639) than either Bill Cowher (619), or Knoll (572).</p>
      <p>Should Tomlin lead the Steelers on a postseason run, beginning with a matchup &#x2014; if the season ended today &#x2014; against Justin Herbert making his first postseason start for the Los Angeles Chargers. A win in the playoffs with this roster
        might be Tomlin&#x2019;s most impressive feat to date, given the decline of Roethlisberger&#x2019;s arm and depths from which Pittsburgh needed to climb from a 1-3 start.</p>
      <p>The AFC is a madhouse and constant carousel of changing parts. One week, the Bengals have home field advantage. Next, they rank in the bottom of the AFC North. The Titans are winning without Derrick Henry and Josh Allen made the other Josh Allen
        look like a pedestrian pumpkin instead of a MVP.</p>
      <p>Anything is possible but, if Pittsburgh pulls a rabbit out of the hat this winter, Tomlin&#x2019;s legacy in the NFL might just be secured as one of the greats.</p>
      <p>Respect isn&#x2019;t given, it&#x2019;s earned. Sixteen years above .500? Politely adjust your head coaching tiers with Tomlin at the top, and maybe ask Reid and Payton why they&#x2019;re playing catch up and if they&#x2019;d consider heading out
        to USC.</p>

        <h3>These players will shape the second half of the NFL season</h3>
        <p>We have officially crossed the midway point of the first 18-week NFL season, and many of the usual suspects have been the stars of the first 272 games of the 2021 slate.</p>
        <p>Kyler Murray has emerged as a superstar in the NFC, leading the Arizona Cardinals to the top seed, if the playoffs were to begin today. Tom Brady continues to outrun Father Time, and is a legitimate threat to win his fourth NFL MVP award.
          Meanwhile, Lamar Jackson has the Baltimore Ravens in the thick of the race for the top spot in the AFC.</p>
        <p>But, who will be the players who define the season&#x2019;s second half? Who are the breakout players starting to emerge? FanSided spoke to several NFL coaches, executives, and scouts across the league to find out who they believe will be the
          players who shape this season&#x2019;s second half.</p>
        <h5>Matt Ryan, QB, Atlanta Falcons</h5>
        <p>
          <em>&#x201C;I think my biggest surprise so far is what Matt Ryan is doing. The Falcons are playing really well right now. I&#x2019;d watch out for them.&#x201D; &#x2013; NFC head coach</em>
        </p>
        <p>Ryan and the Falcons are .500, knocking on the postseason doorstep, as the 36-year-old veteran has completed 69.4 percent of his passes for 2,157 yards with 15 touchdowns to just six interceptions.</p>
        <h5>Odell Beckham Jr., WR</h5>
        <p>
          <em>&#x201C;Wherever Odell Beckham Jr. winds up, he&#x2019;s going to be an instant playmaker.&#x201D; &#x2013; NFC Personnel executive</em>
        </p>
        <p>Beckham was waived by the Cleveland Browns on Monday.</p>
        <h5>Xavier McKinney, S, NY Giants</h5>
        <p>
          <em>&#x201C;Sunday seemed like just a glimpse of the kind of impact he can make on a game. He&#x2019;s someone teams are going to need to pay attention to.&#x201D; &#xA0;</em>&#x2013;
          <em>NFC head coach&#xA0;</em>
        </p>
        <p>McKinney, the Giants&#x2019; second-year safety out of Alabama, had his second two-interception game of the season against the Las Vegas Raiders Sunday afternoon, returning a Derek Carr interception for a touchdown in the third quarter and hauling
          in a second pick in the fourth quarter of a 23-16 New York upset win.</p>
        <h5>Christian McCaffrey, RB, Carolina Panthers</h5>
        <p>
          <em>&#x201C;Now that Christian McCaffrey is finally healthy, he&#x2019;s going to hurt some teams making runs to the playoffs. He&#x2019;s a one man spoiler.&#x201D; &#x2013; NFC South Pro Personnel Director</em>
        </p>
        <p>McCaffrey has been activated off injured reserve by the Panthers, after recovering from a hamstring injury. Through four games so far this season McCaffrey has rushed for 253 yards and a touchdown.</p>

          <p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s as flat as any team I&#x2019;ve seen. We basically played what seemed to be lackadaisical.&#x201D;</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>&#x2013; Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones,
            <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/jerry-jones-cowboys-were-flat-162134497.html">via Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>.&#xA0;</em>
        </p>
        <p>The Cowboys better be careful.</p>
        <p>Dallas is going to win the NFC East, and it might not be particularly close. But, if the Cowboys are going to be considered legitimate Super Bowl contenders out of a conference that has developed into a gauntlet as the NFC has, falling behind 30-0
          at home and losing 30-16 to the Denver Broncos simply cannot happen.</p>
        <p>Thanksgiving is a few weeks away, which in addition to turkeys being on the lookout, this is when NFL contenders should be separating themselves from the pack.</p>
        <p>The Cowboys play host to a wounded and beleaguered Raiders team that afternoon at about the time Americans will be onto their second slice of pumpkin pie. But, first Dallas welcomes Matt Ryan and the suddenly white-hot Atlanta Falcons to AT&amp;T
          Stadium Sunday afternoon, before going to Arrowhead in their Turkey Day appetizer on Nov. 21.</p>
        <p>If Dallas slips up Sunday, and falters against the Chiefs, there&#x2019;s a very real possibility Dak Prescott, Ezekiel Elliott, and the Cowboys are 6-4 when the Raiders arrive.</p>
        <p>There are certainly matters far more important and consequential than football facing the Raiders right now, but if Vegas turns things around and knocks off the struggling Chiefs at home this Sunday, there&#x2019;s no reason to think they
          can&#x2019;t pile on a reeling Cowboys squad.</p>
        <p>Especially if the same Cowboys defense that allowed 407 yards of total offense to the Broncos, nearly 50 more than its average allowed per game, shows up to the Turkey Day festivities.</p>
        <p>Dallas has all the pieces in place to make a run this season, with Dak Prescott playing at a high level, Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard forming one of the premier backfield duos in the league, and Dan Quinn&#x2019;s defense anchored by rookie
          playmaker Micah Parsons, pass-rusher Randy Gregory and Defensive Player of The Year front-runner Trevon Diggs.</p>
        <p>However, was Sunday the case of a team sleepwalking through a game it felt it could win by simply showing up? Or a harbinger of what&#x2019;s to come?</p>
        <p>We&#x2019;re about to find out.</p>
        <p>
          <span style="color: inherit;font-family: Oswald, Arial, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600">Final Thought</span>
        </p>
        <p>By any means necessary, the NFL taunting rule has to go.</p>
        <p>That outcomes of one-score games, which make up approximately nine games on an average Sunday, can be decided by an official&#x2019;s interpretation of a player&#x2019;s intent after a big play is doing far more harm than good both to the product
          and competitiveness of NFL games.</p>
        <p>The spirit of the rule that has become a point of emphasis this season, is well-intentioned. There&#x2019;s something to be said for a player blatantly standing over an opponent on the ground, waiving his finger in his face, or making an obscene
          gesture directed at the opposition in celebration being flagged.</p>
        <p>However, when referee Tony Corrente throws a flag on&#xA0;Cassius Marsh briefly looking over at the Steelers&#x2019; sideline, or even the punter running on the field, after he sacked Ben Roethlisberger on third down and the penalty allows
          Pittsburgh to send its offense back on the field to go kick a go-ahead field goal, officials have now dictated the outcome of the game.</p>
        <p>Likewise, when Eagles linebacker Genard Avery said something along the sidelines after a tackle to Buccaneers running back Leonard Fournette, which drew a penalty and extended a Tampa Bay drive that wound up sinking Philadelphia, a win was decided
          by a referee&#x2019;s interpretation rather than the flow of the game.</p>

        <p>Here is the rule, as it appears in the NFL&#x2019;s rulebook:</p>
        <p>
          <em>&#x201C;The use of baiting or taunting acts or words that engender ill will between teams.&#x201D;</em>
        </p>
        <p>Did Avery engender ill will when he stood up after Fournette was tackled?</p>
        <p>When Marsh looked towards Pittsburgh&#x2019;s sideline before running off the field, did he somehow bait the Steelers?</p>
        <p>It seems, this season, with this rule, NFL referees are being forced to make snap judgements about a player&#x2019;s intent, and are crossing the line from enforcing the rule to interjecting their interpretation into outcomes.</p>
        <p>No one is going to stop watching the NFL because of the taunting rule, but if this continues to be called at such a fervent level into the playoff chase or in the postseason, the risk is very real that a referee&#x2019;s opinion might keep a team
          out of the playoffs or end their run prematurely.</p>
        <p>There have already been 16 teams called for taunting. It&#x2019;s only a matter of time before one of these calls makes a real impact on a team&#x2019;s season, rather than just the outcome of one game.</p>
        <p>Just imagine what would have happened had Monday night&#x2019;s game been played in Chicago and the flag in question knocked the Bears from postseason contention.</p>
        <p>Is that what the NFL wants? Is the league office ready for
          <em>that&#xA0;</em>level of public backlash?</p>
        <p>Unless the NFL acts swiftly to better instruct officials what constitutes taunting, and takes the interpretation of the rule out of the realm where human judgement is the deciding factor, that&#x2019;s the very real risk is running.</p>

      <p class="speakable-content">To be clear, the
        <a href="https://fansided.com/nba/nba-teams/oklahoma-city-thunder/">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>
        offense is not good right now. Through nine games they&#x2019;ve averaged just 98.0 points per 100 possessions, worse than any team but the Detroit Pistons. But in terms of offensive methodology, they&#x2019;ve become an unbelievable outlier.</p>
      <p>So far this season, they&#x2019;ve been averaging a league-high
        <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1">70.2 drives per game</a>
        (any play where a player catches the ball at least 20 feet from the basket and dribbles to within 10 feet of the basket). The team with the next-most drives, the Charlotte Hornets, are averaging 56.6 and the difference between the Thunder and the
        Hornets is roughly the same as the difference between the second-place Hornets and the Lakers in 21st.</p>
      <p>Last season&#x2019;s Thunder averaged 61.7 drives per game,
        <a href="https://twitter.com/HickoryHigh/status/1458450368531156997">the first team to break 60 drives per game</a>
        since the NBA first started collecting drive statistics with player tracking systems during the 2013-14 season.</p>

        <h2 class="speakable-content">What makes the Oklahoma City Thunder such a dangerous dribble-drive team?</h2>
        <p>The Thunder&#x2019;s dribble-penetration starts with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. He is averaging 22.9 drives per game this season, down slightly
          <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;TeamID=1610612760">from the 25.2 he averaged last season</a>
          &#x2014; a mark that was the highest single-season player mark since drive statistics began being tracked. As with last year, he&#x2019;s been incredibly effective &#x2014; drawing a foul on just over 8 percent of his drives, shooting 47.7 percent
          and recording nearly twice as many assists (14) as turnovers (9).</p>
        <p>His dribble-penetration game has made him one of the most effective individual creators in the league. He averages 7.8 isolation possessions per game, the most in the league, ranking in the 77th percentile in scoring efficiency.</p>
        <p>But the Thunder&#x2019;s attack this season has also been buoyed by rookie Josh Giddey, who is averaging 13.8 drives per game. With his size, handle and body control, Giddey has been adept at getting into the lane against a variety of defenders
          and the Thunder have already gotten creative with ways to get him the ball on the move so
          <a href="https://twitter.com/Ballislife/status/1453555623631761410">he&#x2019;s attacking with momentum</a>
          against an already scrambling defense.</p>

        <p>Giddey&#x2019;s approach is a bit different in that he&#x2019;s much more likely to drive as a means of creating for others. He&#x2019;s passed on 57.3 percent of his drives so far this season, one of the<a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives/?sort=DRIVE_PASSES_PCT&amp;dir=1&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;CF=DRIVES*GE*10">
            highest marks</a>
          in the league for a player averaging at least 10.0 drives per game. That number may come down as he gets more comfortable as a finisher against NBA-level rim protectors but it&#x2019;s a different look that should add balance to the Thunder&#x2019;s
          offense down the road.</p>
        <p>In addition to Giddey and Gilgeous-Alexander, the rest of the Thunder supporting cast look confident and empowered to attack when the ball is swung to them. Lu Dort has averaged 10.6 drives per game, shooting 52.0 percent. Many of these drives are
          attacking closeouts after someone else has already warped the defense but being able to do more than just spot-up is an important variable for his offensive development.</p>
        <p>The Thunder also have three other players &#x2014; Kenrich Williams, Darius Bazley and Ty Jerome &#x2014; averaging at least 5.0 drives per game. Williams and Bazley are particularly interesting as bigger wings who spend a good deal of their
          minutes playing as 4s. The Thunder are often playing small ball lineups without a traditional center and the ability of even their bigs to attack closeouts and create off the dribble when given an opening makes them much tougher to guard.</p>
        <p>Of course, results matter. For all their outlier dribble penetration, the Thunder have still been one of the least effective offenses in the league. The presumable next step in building out this young team is adding the outside shooters to really
          take advantage of all the levels they have for collapsing the defense. The Thunder currently tank seventh in catch-and-shoot 3-point attempts per game but are dead-last in percentage, hitting just 29.5 percent. That number may come up a bit naturally
          as the season goes along but for them to hit their ceiling down the road they&#x2019;ll need players like Dort, Bazley and Giddey to be capable spot-up threats, or turn some of those roster spots over for players who are more multi-faceted threats.</p>

          <strong>The Yankees aren&#x2019;t sure they can rely on Aaron Hicks any longer. That could push New York to make a big bid on Starling Marte in free agency.&#xA0;</strong>
        </em>
      </p>
      <p class="speakable-content">Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman makes no secret of his club&#x2019;s need to find a new starting shortstop in free agency. The more interesting news coming out of his recent comments to the media is that finding a
        new starting center fielder might be just as high a priority for the team this offseason.</p>
      <p>The team hopes that Aaron Hicks can find a way to stay healthy in 2021 but the unfortunate reality is that he&#x2019;s only
        <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-gm-brian-cashman-on-payroll-needs-for-2022">managed to play 145 games over the last three seasons</a>
        due to a variety of injuries. Expecting him to shoulder the load of being the everyday centerfielder next season would be more of a wish than a plan for the Yankees.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The uncertainty around Hicks is precisely why Cashman claims he will &#x201C;evaluate all opportunities&#x201D; regarding the outfield position ahead of Opening Day. A trade for a new center fielder is always a possibility, but dipping into free
        agency for a new solution would be the cleaner type of transaction.</p>
      <h2 class="speakable-content">Yankees rumors: Starling Marte makes so much sense</h2>
      <p>There are a number of big-name shortstops on the open market this offseason, but the class of center fielders available to teams is remarkably thin. Marte is, by far, the top option in this year&#x2019;s class.</p>
      <p>The Yankees might be hesitant to commit a big contract to a 33-year-older who depends heavily on speed, but Marte&#x2019;s outstanding production over the last few seasons should quell a lot of those concerns. The only center fielders with
        <a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/yankees-gm-brian-cashman-on-payroll-needs-for-2022">higher WAR than Marte over the last four seasons are George Springer and Mike Trout</a>. In short, the Yankees could give Marte a lucrative deal and still deal with a reasonable amount of age-related regression without getting burned by the contract.</p>

      </div>
      <p>It&#x2019;s possible another team could beat the Yankees to the punch with Marte if they&#x2019;re willing to make him the centerpiece to their offseason plans. New York probably isn&#x2019;t going to rush in with an offer that blows away the
        competition. If Marte&#x2019;s market doesn&#x2019;t take off right away, look for the Yankees to pounce when they believe the time is right.</p>

    <em>
      <strong>Duke basketball pulled through with a big win in the Champions Classic over Kentucky and college basketball media was loving the action.</strong>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p class="speakable-content">The finale of the Champions Classic on Tuesday night promised to be a great one to start the 2021-22 college basketball season with the No. 9-ranked Duke Blue Devils staring down the No. 10-ranked Kentucky Wildcats, the
    first game in what will be Coach K&#x2019;s final season with the former.</p>
  <p>Though it was tightly contested throughout both halves, it was Duke that ultimately pulled away with the 79-71 win. They rode big performances from their star freshman, Trevor Keels and Paolo Banchero, who combined for 47 points, to the big win.
    Kentucky held their own, though, which was in doubt after a shaky exhibition showing against Miles College.</p>
  <p>Still, it&#x2019;s the Blue Devils that scored the win over John Calipari&#x2019;s team. But after the meeting, the college basketball media was just plain impressed with what they saw on the floor at Madison Square Garden.</p>

  <p>The general consensus &#x2014; though not unanimous, seems to be that both Duke and Kentucky showed well on Tuesday night at the Champions Classic and have bright seasons ahead.</p>
  <p></p>
  <p>It&#x2019;s hard to argue with that as well. The Wildcats are clearly still gelling but to hang with a team as talented as the Blue Devils for 40 minutes and never truly be out of it speaks highly of Calipari&#x2019;s squad. And as for the
    talented counterparts, the Coach K Farewell Tour seems as if it&#x2019;s going to run quite smoothly with this group on the floor.</p>

      <strong>No. 1 overall recruit Chet Holmgren made a statement in his debut game with Gonzaga on Tuesday night.</strong>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p class="speakable-content">As is the case every season, there is hype surrounding the Gonzaga Bulldogs. They may hae fell just short of winning the National Championship last year, but fans had plenty ot look forward to in the 2021-22 season. Like,
    the debut of class of 2021 top-overall recruit Chet Holmgren.</p>
  <p>Holmgren did not waste anytime to leave speechless, as he helped lead the Bulldogs to a 97-63 win over the Dixie State Trailblazers. The freshman center recorded 14 points, 13 rebounds, seven blocks and six assists in his first official game with
    Gonzaga.</p>

        <h2 class="speakable-content">Chet Holmgren makes history in his Gonzaga debut</h2>
        <p>To say that Holmgren&#x2019;s debut was historic is not hyperbole.
          <a href="https://twitter.com/ESPNStatsInfo/status/1458277035252621315">According to ESPN Stats and Info</a>, Holmgren is the first player in the last 25 seasons to record 10 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and five blocks in his Division I debut.</p>
        <p>The hype around the seven-foot center is legitimate, as if his first game was not proof enough.. Prior to the start of the season, Holmgren has the third-best odds of winning the Naismith College Player of the Year award,
          <a href="https://to.fwdr.co/?af_ad_type=textaf_ad_type=social">per WynnBet</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you did not catch Holmgren&#x2019;s debut, his second-ever game is going to be one of interest. On Saturday night, top-ranked Gonzaga takes on the No. 5 Texas Longhorns in what should be a tremendous game.</p>

      <p>Jokic has been fined one game without pay for &#x201C;forcefully shoving&#x201D; Morris to the floor while his back was turned. Morris sustained a neck injury following the cheap shot.</p>

      <h2 class="speakable-content">Nikola Jokic suspended one game as Markieff Morris and Jimmy Butler face fines for Nuggets-Heat altercation</h2>
      <p>There is a great deal of drama in the fallout of the Morris-Jokic hit, as the brothers of both players
        <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/09/nikola-jokic-brothers-challenged-marcus-morris-twitter/">started arguing back and forth</a>
        over Twitter.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>All Butler shouted were fighting words, but no blows were exchanged. The only possible explanation for the outlandish fine is that the NBA wants to discourage this type of reaction by teammates as they react to flagrant fouls.</p>
      <p>Beyond potentially costing his team the upcoming Pacers game, Jokic is going to pay for missing a game without his salary. With a<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nba/denver-nuggets/nikola-jokic-15393/">
          $31 million salary</a>
        for the 2021-22 season, Jokic will miss out on getting paid approximately $385,114.</p>
      <p>That blow is going to hurt a lot more than anything that happened on Tuesday night.</p>

      <p>Many fans in East Lansing, and observers of the sport in general, were particularly outraged that the Spartans fell behind the Michigan Wolverines (No. 6) after beating their in-state rivals just 10 days prior.</p>
      <p>After the rankings were revealed, though ESPN college football analyst Kirk Herbstreit offered a bit of optimism for Michigan State, saying that there is still a path for the Spartans to claw their way back into the top four:</p>

      <h2 class="speakable-content">Kirk Herbstreit offers Michigan State the path to the College Football Playoff</h2>
      <p>Herbstreit is right in that the Spartans have opportunities in the regular season but, more importantly than that, they still control their own destiny. It would be nearly impossible for the selection committee to leave out a one-loss Big Ten
        champion, which Michigan State still has the opportunity to secure.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Spartans were the third-ranked team in the first CFP rankings last week and the loss obviously hurts them and makes the path harder. However, in the Big Ten East, Mel Tucker&#x2019;s team still has the tiebreaker over No. 6-ranked Michigan,
        which ultimately helps their chances moving forward.</p>
      <p>In two weeks the Spartans will play at No. 4 Ohio State, which has yet to lose a conference game. If they can just win their next three games, then Michigan State will win their division and go play in the conference championship game. Win that
        and they would almost certainly be in.</p>

        <strong>The Chicago Bears uniforms feature the letters GSH on the stripes of their sleeves in a tribute to former owner George Halas.</strong>
      </em>
    </p>
    <p class="speakable-content">Have you ever watched the
      <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a>
      and caught a glimpse of &#x201C;GSH&#x201D; on the left sleeve of their uniforms?</p>
    <p>If you haven&#x2019;t, look closely again. You&#x2019;ll see it clear as day.</p>
    <p>Those letters are actually a tribute to one of the most important figures in NFL history.</p>
    <h2 class="speakable-content">What does GSH stand for on the Bears uniforms?</h2>
    <p>GSH stands for George S. Halas, the former Bears player, coach and owner who helped to found the NFL.</p>
    <p>Halas played for Chicago from 1920 to 1929, serving as a player-coach all the while. He spent three different stints coaching the team, winning his first NFL championship in 1921 and his eight in 1963. That same year he was inducted into the Pro
      Football Hall of Fame.</p>
    <p>Halas coached Mike Ditka and then hired him as Chicago&#x2019;s head coach in 1982. Ditka went on to become the second-winningest coach in franchise history, behind only Halas himself.</p>
    <p>The Bears do not exist without Halas and arguably, the NFL as we know it would not be what it is.</p>
    <p>The George Halas Trophy is still given to the NFC champion each year.</p>
    <p>Halas died in 1983. In 1984, the GSH was added to the left sleeve and it has been there ever since.</p>

      <strong>Looking at the MLB Award finalists after they were announced on Monday night with analysis and all the info on MVP, Cy Young and more for 2021.</strong>
    </em>
  </p>
  <p class="speakable-content">On Monday night, the finalists for the major
    <a title="MLB Twitter trolls the Astros after losing the World Series" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/02/astros-lose-world-series-mlb-twitter/" rel="rel">MLB</a>
    awards in the 2021 season were announced with the best players in the league from this past season, in essence, being in the final running for recognition.</p>
  <p>These finalists come on the heels of the
    <a title="MLB Gold Glove winners 2021 by team and position" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/07/mlb-gold-glove-winners-2021-team-position/" rel="rel">Gold Gloves</a>
    being awarded on Sunday night.</p>
  <p>Let&#x2019;s get into the MLB Award finalists with some brief analysis for each award. But first, some information that everyone wants to know.</p>
  <h2 class="speakable-content">When are MLB Awards announced?</h2>
  <p>There are different dates in which the major MLB Awards are announced. Rookies of the Year the year will be awarded on Nov. 15, Managers of the Year will be handed out on Nov. 16, the Cy Young winners will be announced on Nov. 17 and, finally, AL
    and NL MVP will be announced on Nov. 18.</p>
  <p>Now, onto the finalists.</p>
  <h2>MLB Award Finalists for the 2021 season</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>AL MVP</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shohei Ohtani, Los Angeles Angels</li>
    <li>Marcus Semien, Toronto Blue Jays</li>
    <li>Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Toronto Blue Jays</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Despite the unbelievably good season from Vlad Jr., Ohtani&#x2019;s historic two-way season in which he dominated all aspects of the game likely make him a shoo-in to win AL MVP.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>NL MVP</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bryce Harper, Philadelphia Phillies</li>
    <li>Fernando Tatis Jr., San Diego Padres</li>
    <li>Juan Soto, Washington Nationals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Harper is the favorite in the minds of many, especially with a sustained absence for Tatis. However, it&#x2019;s a bit curious that Braves slugger Austin Riley didn&#x2019;t make the cut as a finalist.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>AL Cy Young</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Lance Lynn, Chicago White Sox</li>
    <li>Gerrit Cole, New York Yankees</li>
    <li>Robbie Ray, Toronto Blue Jays</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For much of the year, Cole felt like a lock to win AL Cy Young. But with the Yankees hurler tailing off slightly and Ray coming on super strong, this one might be up in the air.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>NL Cy Young</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Max Scherzer, Washington Nationals/Los Angeles Dodgers</li>
    <li>Corbin Burns, Milwaukee Brewers</li>
    <li>Zack Wheeler, Philadelphia Phillies</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Scherzer is the favorite to take home this award after a dominant season with both the Nats and Dodgers. With that said, the veteran does have some stiff competition with Burnes and Wheeler, even if Scherzer still ends up winning.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>AL Rookie of the Year</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Luis Garcia, Houston Astros</li>
    <li>Randy Arozarena, Tampa Bay Rays</li>
    <li>Wander Franco, Tampa Bay Rays</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The Rays obviously dominate this conversation and you&#x2019;d be hard-pressed to find someone who isn&#x2019;t giving AL Rookie of the year to Franco after he came up and just lit the world on fire almost immediately.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>NL Rookie of the Year</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Jonathan India, Cincinnati Reds</li>
    <li>Trevor Rogers, Miami Marlins</li>
    <li>Dylan Carlson, St. Louis Cardinals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Carlson&#x2019;s play with the Cardinals does deserve plenty of merits but Rogers was one of the bright spots for a down Marlins team, which might earn him some voter support.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>AL Manager of the Year</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dusty Baker, Houston Astros</li>
    <li>Scott Servais, Seattle Mariners</li>
    <li>Kevin Cash, Tampa Bay Rays</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It&#x2019;s always hard to predict managerial awards but you&#x2019;d have to bet that Cash will get a good amount of support after running away with the division in a year where he was supposed to lead a mediocre Rays team.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>NL Manager of the Year</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Craig Counsell, Milwaukee Brewers</li>
    <li>Gabe Kapler, San Francisco Giants</li>
    <li>Mike Shildt, St. Louis Cardinals</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Kapler feels like a borderline lock to win after the Giants led MLB in wins in the regular season. Though it would be ironic to see Shildt win the award after getting axed by the Cardinals.</p>
