Nobody’s holding a knife to you to go be his lover…” at which point the father interjects: “It’s not a ‘he’, Mom. It’s a ‘she’.”</p><p>The clip ends with Elyse’s dad telling her: “If you choose this path then you’re going to need to speed up being an adult really fast, OK?” before suggesting that he plans to cut her off financially.</p><p>He can then be heard storming off, as he tells her: “I would never have thought you would do this to me.”</p><p>Elyse’s recordings garnered more than 2.5 million views in just two days on TikTok alone, as users shared their admiration for her – and sadness at her parents’ response.</p><p>“The fact that [your father] is making it seem like you have to choose him or your family is horrible. Your dad chose that, not you,” one commented.</p><p>“Blood can be family, but family isn’t always blood. It took me a long time to come to that realisation but I finally learned and I’ve never been happier,” said another.</p><p>Quoting Elyse’s mum, a third wrote: “‘Did you really think we would support it?’ YES! YES! Because when you have children you sign up for loving them unconditionally.”</p><p>And a fourth added: “Leave that home. Find your family. [Your dad] has a lot of growing up, reflection and acceptance to go through.</p><p>“You are so true to you and so loved.”In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@enoblehere/video/6969770878624222470?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">separate video</a>, Elyse revealed that her parents had kicked her out of the house, with her mum giving her just five minutes to gather her belongings.</p><p>She added that her dad doesn’t want to “see me or talk to me” and that, rather than speak to his daughter as she left their home, he got in his car and drove away.</p><p>Elyse said her mum then told her: “You don’t have to pack as though you’re moving out,” to which she responded: “You’re not giving me a choice.”</p><p>She stressed: “If you think it’s a choice for me to be who I am, you’re not giving me a choice.”In a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@enoblehere/video/6969425745865084166?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1" target="_blank">happier clip</a>, Elyse filmed herself with boyfriend Ash, as the pair looked loved-up and content.</p><p>Confirming that she’d been kicked out of home for “being with a trans man,” she smiled defiantly and said: “Happy <a href="/topic/pride" target="_blank">Pride</a> month, everybody!”</p>]]></description><guid>2656196445</guid><dc:creator>Vicky Stephens (Admin)</dc:creator><author>Vicky Stephens (Admin)</author><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 15:48:17 GMT</pubDate><dc:date>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 15:48:17+00:00</dc:date><dc:modified>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 15:48:17+00:00</dc:modified><media:content url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28594337&amp;width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C382&amp;height=700" type="image/jpeg" medium="image"><media:credit><![CDATA[<p>@enoblehere/TikTok</p>]]></media:credit></media:content><category>Identities</category></item><item><title>Couple breaking up</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/couple-breaking-up</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Couple breaking up </p>]]></description><guid>2656215510</guid><dc:creator>indy 100</dc:creator><author>indy 100</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:22 GMT</pubDate><dc:date>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:22+00:00</dc:date><dc:modified>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:22+00:00</dc:modified><media:content url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/couple-breaking-up-alt.png?id=28724964&amp;width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C17&amp;height=700" type="image/jpeg" medium="image"><media:credit><![CDATA[<p>Couple breaking up credit</p>]]></media:credit><media:text><![CDATA[<p>Couple breaking up caption</p>]]></media:text></media:content><category>News</category></item><item><title>Heartbreaking - they are getting a divorce!</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/top-100/heartbreaking-they-are-getting-a-divorce</link><description><![CDATA[<p>oh no!</p>]]></description><guid>2656209960</guid><dc:creator>indy 100</dc:creator><author>indy 100</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:21 GMT</pubDate><dc:date>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:21+00:00</dc:date><dc:modified>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:21+00:00</dc:modified><media:content url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/getting-a-divorce-alt.png?id=28699792&amp;width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C17&amp;height=700" type="image/jpeg" medium="image"><media:credit><![CDATA[<p>Getting a divorce credit</p>]]></media:credit><media:text><![CDATA[<p>Getting a divorce caption</p>]]></media:text></media:content><category>Top 100</category></item><item><title>They are so cute - getting married!</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/top-100/they-are-so-cute-getting-married</link><description><![CDATA[<p>blah</p>]]></description><guid>2656209942</guid><dc:creator>indy 100</dc:creator><author>indy 100</author><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:21 GMT</pubDate><dc:date>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:21+00:00</dc:date><dc:modified>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:51:21+00:00</dc:modified><media:content url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/getting-married-alt.png?id=28699792&amp;width=1245&amp;coordinates=0%2C17%2C0%2C17&amp;height=700" type="image/jpeg" medium="image"><media:credit><![CDATA[<p>Getting married credit</p>]]></media:credit><media:text><![CDATA[<p>Getting married caption</p>]]></media:text></media:content><category>Top 100</category></item><item><title>couple in love</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/couple-in-love</link><description><![CDATA[<p><br/></p>
