        <![CDATA[<p>When it comes to the hotly contested world of battle royale brawlers, few have as much universal appeal as <a rel="noopener" href="/fortnite/" target="_blank" title="Fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. Epic Games' third-person shooter has been shooting up the competition since 2017, and as we continue Chapter 2 Season 7, it shows no signs of slowing down.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>With so much hype surrounding <em>Fortnite</em> - and a constant stream of updates - fans might be asking how old they need to be to participate. The most popular mode of <em>Fortnite</em> is the classic 100-player battle royale mode when you go solo or team up in squads to score Victory Royale.</p>
<p>Considering there are so many players in each match, Epic tries to safeguard its younger players. As parents ask whether <em>Fortnite</em> is suitable for their children, they'll want to know how old gamers need to be to play <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>How old do you have to be to play Fortnite?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/oc3bwney/fortnitemarvelskinsjpg.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Fortnite Marvel Skins" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="Epic Games"></p>
<p>While the likes of Activision's <a rel="noopener" href="/call-of-duty/" target="_blank" title="Call of Duty"><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></a> has a higher age threshold due to its gratuitous violence, Epic Games puts a cartoon spin on taking out your opponents. With this in mind, Epic has put a lower age bracket of 12 on most <em>Fortnite</em> matches.</p>
<p>As outlined on the Pan European Game Information (PEGI) site, <em>Fortnite</em> has an age rating of 12. The official PEGI blurb reads, "This game was rated PEGI 12 for frequent scenes of mild violence. It is not suitable for persons under 12 years of age.” </p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em> is rated 12 on the PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Android versions of the game. <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/epic-and-apple-trial-wraps-up-but-what-is-the-likeliest-outcome/" target="_blank" title="Epic And Apple Trial Wraps Up: But What Is The Likeliest Outcome?"><em>Fortnite </em>isn't currently available on Apple</a>, however, it was rated 12 before the game was pulled from the store.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>How old do you have to be to play Fortnite at a competitive level?</h2>
<p>In regards to how old you have to be if you want to play <em>Fortnite</em> at a professional level, the game's <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-c75/competitive-prizes-c95/how-old-do-i-have-to-be-to-be-eligible-to-compete-in-a-fortnite-competitive-event-a3929" target="_blank">FAQ site </a>confirms you have to be 13 to take part in a competitive event.</p>
<p>The FAQ reads: You have to be at least 13 years old (or such other age, if greater, as may be required in your country of residence) to be eligible to participate.  In addition, if you are between the ages of 13-17, you must have permission from your parent or legal guardian to do so".</p>
<p>More and more young players are becoming famous through Twitch and YouTube, meaning there's a growing number of parents who are supporting their up-and-coming streaming stars.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Has Fortnite come under fire for its age restrictions?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/nhmlszyd/cancelfortnitecrewjpg.jpg?width=500&amp;height=254.43383356070942" alt="Fortnite Crew" width="500" height="254.43383356070942" data-caption="Epic Games"></p>
<p>Obviously, there have been some criticisms of how Epic handles <em>Fortnite</em>. Namely, it's been slammed for promoting microtransactions. Seeing videos of <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/angry-parent-v-bucks/" target="_blank" title="Angry Parent Goes Viral After Son Spends Hundreds On V-Bucks">kids spending hundreds of dollars</a> of their parent's money on skins might seem funny, but it's a growing problem for savvy kids that have access to accounts with credit cards linked. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, there are problems with the fact the 12-year-old guidelines aren't always stuck to. Last year, player <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/fortnite-ban-nine-year-old-player-zenon-for-1500-days-whilst-playing-arena-mode/" target="_blank" title="Fortnite Ban Nine-Year-Old Player Zenon for 1500 Days Whilst Playing Arena Mode">Zenon was hit with a ban for playing Arena Mode</a> at a competitive level. The 9-year-old player was associated with DETONA Gaming, but didn't meet Epic's age requirements and was banned. Although Epic states you can play at a competitive level if you are 13, you'll still need your parent's permission. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>How can you prevent problems with young players in Fortnite?</h2>
<p>Away from Epic's official stance, parents are advised to limit their child's abilities in-game. There are options for in-game voice chat, although they can be limited for younger players. Any adult or inappropriate behaviour that is picked up or reported by Epic will lead to a ban.</p>
<p>Finally, it's advised that parents keep a close eye on their children while playing <em>Fortnite</em> and make sure they aren't being subjected to potentially adult behaviours from rivals. Apart from that, enjoy <em>Fortnite</em> (if you're old enough) and make your way to the top of the Battle Pass in <a rel="noopener" href="/guides/what-are-the-most-popular-fortnite-skins/" target="_blank" title="What Are The Most Popular Fortnite Skins?">your favourite <em>Fortnite </em>skins</a>. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>As arguably the most important role in the game, with its ability to influence the map due to its position in the middle of Summoner’s Rift, the mid-laner can be a building block for any professional <a href="/league-of-legends/" title="LOL"><em>League of Legends</em></a> team. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>For North America, the <a href="/articles/lcs-reportedly-aiming-to-make-significant-changes-to-lcs-format/" title="LCS Reportedly Aiming To Make Significant Changes To LCS Format"><em>League of Legends</em> Championship Series (LCS)</a>, this role has been an issue when it comes to talent being cultivated for it throughout the years. This, in turn, has forced LCS teams to look elsewhere for a good building block — Europe has been the main culprit. </p>
<p>As it stands, the LCS currently houses five imported mid-laners, all from Europe. There’s Team Liquid with Nicolaj “<a href="/articles/jensen-record-breaking-contract-team-liquid/" title="Jensen 'Offered Record-Breaking Contract' To Stay With Team Liquid "><strong>Jensen</strong></a>” Jensen, <a href="/teams/team-solomid/" title="Team Solomid">Team SoloMid</a> with Tristan “<strong>PowerOfEvil</strong>” Schrage, <a href="/teams/evil-geniuses/" title="Evil Geniuses">Evil Geniuses</a> with Daniele “<strong>Jiizuke</strong>” di Mauro, <a href="/teams/cloud9/" title="Cloud9">Cloud9</a> with Luka “<strong>Perkz</strong>” Perkovic and now, recently added, Felix “<strong>Abbedagge</strong>” Braun with <a href="/teams/100-thieves/" title="100 Thieves">100 Thieves</a>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Whether it’s North American SoloQ or how fans, viewers and the general community view and treat them, all of the import mid-laners have their own story to tell. </p>
<p>We had a chance to speak to all five of the import mid-laners and asked them about their experiences in the North American scene, topics like SoloQ and the region’s reactions to their individual play came to mind. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Jiizuke has been in the LCS for around a year and a half. During <a href="/articles/2020-lcs-summer-split-playoffs-review/" title="LCS Summer Split Playoffs - Surprise Performers, Favourites, And Disappointments">2020’s Summer Split</a>, he was benched and had little to no chance to return as the team decided to go with North American native and now retired, Greyson “Goldenglue” Gilmer. Once in 2021, that changed. Evil Geniuses announced their starting roster for the season’s start and Jiizuke was named their starting mid-laner once again. </p>
<p>During spring, Jiizuke surpassed expectations. He, alongside the rest of the Evil Geniuses squad, started the season with a bang, particularly in the LCS Lock In tournament. Although the team’s overall performances didn’t roll over to the regular season as inconsistencies arose, Jiizuke’s did. According to him, it certainly did, but in his eyes, it felt like it was all for nothing, as one single play tainted it. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>“To be fair, not so good I’d say. To make an example would be the last split I played in LCS, this spring split 2021. To me, I played really good but the whole performance, all my stats — which I never played for stats, I’m just playing like I’m me every single game still, and I was like rank 1, rank 2 on every single stat. And all that was clouded by a single Lucian game that we were all inting a bit but the most famous was my dive but everyone inted on some team fights and that’s why we lost,” Jiizuke explained.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/GorgeousVenomousGoblinResidentSleeper-Zbt7uoSgo7kHyvGt" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<div class="artVideo"><iframe width="300" height="240" src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=GorgeousVenomousGoblinResidentSleeper-Zbt7uoSgo7kHyvGt&amp;parent=www.ggrecon.com&amp;autoplay=false" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>“Why I make that example is because if I did this in Europe or, let’s say I was in LPL or LCK, the thing is different because there are players like this everywhere. Caps in Europe, Rookie in LPL [...] even Chovy sometimes, he has bad games, but the important thing is what you do for the most part,” Jiizuke said, “To me [in] the split, I played good, for the most part — 80%, 90% and I had some bad games, but we’re human, right? Everyone can make mistakes. It was clouded so hard; to me my performance last split was worthy of top one, top two mid-laner. And if I did that in Europe, I would be treated as such but in NA, I was just ‘haha, he inted there.’ It sucks, you know?”</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Contrast this with PowerOfEvil, who’s been on a number of teams since his inauguration to pro-<em>League of Legends</em> play, playing on big-name teams such Unicorns of Live, Origen and Misfits in Europe to then join the likes of Counter Logic Gaming, FlyQuest and now Team SoloMid in North America. He has personally enjoyed his stay in the region so far. </p>
<p><img src="/media/a5nk0vnw/mid-laners-poe.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.40000000000003?width=500&amp;height=333" alt="" width="500" height="333" data-caption="Tina Jo/Riot Games via ESPAT" /></p>
<p>“I enjoy playing in North America a lot. I feel like you can learn a lot every time, when you have a change, let’s say from when I did my change from Europe to NA, I faced nine new mid-laners [and] had different teammates. I learned how North American teams communicate. I could help maybe bring on some of that European communication, some of that European playstyle into North American teams. I think this exchange between European and North American teams is really helpful. And, overall, I really liked playing on my old teams and I think my teammates are all great,” PowerOfEvil happily said. </p>
<p>Like the two players that were just mentioned, Jensen has had experience in the North American region. But unlike them, Jensen has a unique perspective. Although he’s from Europe, he didn’t quite get to play at the professional level in that region, thus making his experience different compared to all of the imported mid-laners. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Out of all of the five mid-laners, Jensen is by far the most tenured with over six years of play in the region. He first started out with Cloud9 where he came up short multiple times to later making LCS history with his joining of Team Liquid — becoming part of the legendary dynasty that won four LCS titles in a row. As the only import mid-laner who is a North American resident, Jensen had his own view on North America, particularly its SoloQ.</p>
<p>“Growing up I used to play strictly in EU and all that kind of things and then [...] I’ve been playing for six years in North America now, and it feels like a lot more chill in a sense. When you mess up in SoloQ and stuff, people don’t really type to you. Even if you’re having a bad game, it kind of feels like no one really cares too much,” Jensen said. “Whereas when I grew up playing EU SoloQ if you f---- up people will let you know you f--- up basically,” Jensen laughed. “I think people can get complacent here, so you kind of have to I guess be aware of how you’re playing yourself a lot and just focus on yourself if that makes sense. I never really played pro in EU, so I don’t really know too well how to compare it, but enjoy my life here in America. Playing pro has been a pleasure.” </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>As the two newest additions to the league — pertaining to imported mid-laners —, both Perkz and Abbedagge had more reserved answers. In a lot of people’s minds, Perkz was <em>the</em> offseason move this past offseason, and this is the player whose role swapped from mid-lane to AD Carry before it was cool to role swap. Having played in G2 Esports for five years, his sudden joining of the LCS brought in a new perspective. In many’s eyes, Perkz is the Western G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time), his resume of eight LEC (some of them in the former EULCS) titles, a World Finals appearance and a Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) championship show that. </p>
<p>As the most coronated player in the West, here’s what he had to say on his North American experience so far. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>“It’s been pretty not bad, it’s been pretty good. SoloQ is slightly worse than in EU, but I don’t think it’s that much of a difference. Honestly, it’s been good. I didn’t have any expectations really because I didn’t know what I was going into, but the level of play is definitely slightly lower than EU. It’s still not bad,” Perkz said. </p>
<p>Like Perkz, Abbedagge is new to the LCS this season. Having just joined 100 Thieves in the break between spring and summer, out of all of the mid-laners he’s had the least experience in the region so far. </p>

</div>
<p>“I think [...] it definitely feels different when you play <em>League of Legends</em> here against other teams. I think every region has their own playstyle and tendencies, so I’ve just been observing. I think other mid-laners are good as well. But, I’m still pretty new, and you cannot say that much when I’ve only been here for three weeks, not scrimming that long.” </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Each mid-laner has had their fair share of experiences, and due to the nature of each playing for a different team, it vastly differs. Success and failure are massive dictators for this, especially when it comes to a region like North America, who is subject to constant ridicule and criticism year after year. For a tenured mid-laner in the region like Jensen to a newcomer to Abbedagge, only time will tell how their experiences will culminate. </p>

<p>As we see gaming and esports develop worldwide, a range of marketing and exposure techniques have been applied to different business models, as seen in the FaZe and 100 Thieves mainstream content creation schemes and the huge <a href="/articles/tsm-signs-210-million-naming-rights-deal-with-crypto-exchange-ftx/" title="TSM Signs $210 Million Naming Rights Deal With Crypto Exchange FTX">partnerships from TSMFTX</a> and <a href="/articles/the-general-nrg-rocket-league-rename/" title="NRG Rocket League Team Rename To 'The General NRG'">NRG</a>.</p>
<p>The next minds that come through in esports determine our future, and one group of students look to be heading in the right way. </p>

<p>After catching the eyes of esports giants Dignitas, the organisation has now come up with a wholesome gift for the school.</p>
<h2>Dignitas Donate Free Jerseys To Esports School</h2>
<p>Having spotted the lesson on Twitter, Dignitas' Vice President of Talent Heather '<strong>sapphiRe</strong>' Garozzo revealed that she would be willing to donate a range of Dignitas jerseys to the school, which could help them learn about design, branding, and merchandising.</p>
<p>Two weeks down the line and the kids were all sporting the Dignitas apparel, in one of esports' most wholesome images.</p>

<p>SapphiRe also took to Twitter to say: "This makes me SO happy. I was in the middle of looking for charities to donate outdated Dignitas<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"> jerseys. I couldn't have found a better fit. These kids spending their summer learning about esports makes me SO emotional".</span></p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">Dignitas' branding may come as a perfect example to the young esports students, having revamped their look and logo on multiple occasions. Most recently, the European organisation switched back to their iconic alien logo, coming away from the owl that we had become accustomed to. Despite their change of mascots, the black and yellow combination is always associated with Dignitas.</span></p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">The students have also been studying a range of titles, such as <a href="/fortnite/" title="Fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em> </a>and <a href="/league-of-legends/" title="LOL"><em>League of Legends</em></a>.</span></p>

<p>The organisation currently has a <em>League of Legends</em> side who operate in the French League, recently achieving a top-four placement. As the season comes towards its climax, Team BDS will continue supporting their current team, until the World Championships end and they will officially acquire the Schalke 04 spot.</p>
<h2>What happens to the Schalke 04’s Roster?</h2>
<p>The Schalke 04 roster are currently under contract until the end of this season, where they will become free agents. Following the end of the Summer Split and Worlds in November, Team BDS could decide to sign the same players on a free transfer or look to build their own squad, depending on buyouts of other players in the market.</p>
<p>Should Team BDS look for a new roster, the current Schalke side will be allowed to sign for whichever team comes in for them, without any influence from Team BDS.</p>
<p>Frenchman Ilias "<strong>Nuclearint</strong>" Bizriken signed for Schalke in May (three months into the negotiations between Schalke and Team BDS), who could become the focal point for their organisation which has heavy French influence. </p>
<p>The org currently has two French stars in their <em>Rocket League</em> roster in Evan "<strong>m0nkey m00n</strong>" Rogez and Alex "<strong>Extra</strong>" Paoli, and a full <em>Rainbow Six</em> roster from the nation, all of whom compete from their compound.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>One of the greatest <em><a href="/counter-strike/" title="CS:GO">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</a></em>, Nathan "<strong>NBK-</strong>" Schmitt, players to ever grace the game has officially announced his retirement, confirming a switch to Riot Games' <a rel="noopener" href="/valorant/" target="_blank" title="VALORANT"><em>VALORANT</em></a>.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>The one-year-old title has already robbed some of <em>CS:GO's</em> greatest generational talents, but none more exciting than NBK. </p>
<p>Taking to Twitter, the 27-year-old Frenchman announced his "new beginning".</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/NBK/status/1409889405607763983?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>Claiming that he's "done it all" in <em>CS</em>, his venture into <em>VALORANT</em> does begin as a free agent, yet to announce which team he will be joining. </p>
<p>His 12-year long <em>CS</em> career saw NBK notch up over $800,000 in prize money, with lengthy stints at Team EnVyUS, G2 Esports, Team Vitality, and OG. NBK will now leave OG, after moving to the inactive roster in February of this year.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">

</div>
<p>NBK won eighteen major championships in his <em>CS</em> career, including multiple DreamHack's, ESL Series, and even a World Championship for France in 2015.</p>
<p>He now joins the likes of Spencer "Hiko" Martin, Sam "DaZeD" Marine, and Shahzeeb "ShahZaM" Khan, who have made the switch to VALORANT, the latter of who won the first international LAN and set down a foundation for <em>Counter-Strike</em> supremacy in <em>VALORANT</em>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The rumour mill has been churning away recently, especially when it comes to <a href="/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-fans-save-tsushima-island/" title="Ghost Of Tsushima Fans Raise Thousands To Save Real-Life Tsushima Island"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>. Talk of a new expansion coming to the game have been circulating due to a fresh leak, and in the wake of the game’s incredible success, fans are just about ready to return to Tsushima (or Ikishima, as the leaks have suggested the single-player DLC will take place).</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>And it looks like they might have the chance soon, as an ESRB listing has uncovered that a new version of <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>is on the way. </p>
<h2>Ghost Of Tsushima: Director’s Cut Leaks</h2>
<p><img src="/media/3qcifpbt/ghost-of-tsushima.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.33333333333337" alt="Ghosts Of Tsushima: Director's Cut Leaks" width="500" height="333.33333333333337" data-caption="Sucker Punch Productions"></p>

</div>
<p>Following in the footsteps of <em>Death Stranding </em>with its cinematic titles, <em>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut </em>looks to be on its way, thanks to a leak via an ESRB listing. The listing, discovered and publicised by popular leaker Nibellion, explains the reasons that the title has earned the rating of ‘M’ for Mature.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Nibellion/status/1409823930051796995?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>“This is an action game in which players assume the role of a samurai (Jin Sakai) on a quest for vengeance against Mongol invaders in 13th century Japan”, begins the rating summary. “Players traverse open-world environments, interact with characters, complete quests (eg assassinations), and infiltrate enemy strongholds”.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>This description sounds a lot like the previous game, but in the wake of the rumours of a <em>Ghost of Ikishima </em>single-player DLC, many fans expect the Director’s Cut to be the vessel for new single-player content in the world of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>This isn’t the only <em>Tsushima </em>leak, of course, as some new artwork has suggested that <a href="/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-pc/">the game could soon come to PC</a>. Perhaps the PC release could be the Director’s Cut?</p>
<p>Of course, we’ll have to wait and see, as there’s every chance that the latest DLC could still come to the base game and that the director’s cut will come a little later down the line. But of course, as pressure mounts on PlayStation to announce a <a href="/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel/">State Of Play</a> conference, who knows - we could find out these details shortly.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>China’s Royal Never Give Up have won their second <a href="http://www.ggrecon.com/league-of-legends" data-cke-saved-href="http://www.ggrecon.com/league-of-legends"><em>League of Legends</em></a> Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) as an organisation (and the third for the region), after they took series that went the distance versus Korea’s DAMWON KIA. The teams traded games up until the fifth and final game, in which RNG decisively took control from the start and never let go.</p>
<p>RNG and DK opened up their best-of-series with a highly contested game one, in which RNG had the upper hand for the duration. By the 10-minute mark, RNG had First Blood from earlier in the game and had accrued a gold lead passively. This prompted them to start the first Rift Herald of the game in which DK decided to contest. RNG’s positioning in the team fight was stellar, with their AD Carries getting to deal damage from the back — they separated DK’s members and focused them down accordingly. This netted RNG a team fight win and the first Herald of the game.</p>
<p>Nothing would happen for the next eight minutes until Kim "<strong>Canyon</strong>" Geon-bu decided to play the waiting game in the top lane for a gank. This long-awaited gank did net them a kill, but it was to the detriment of the Korean representatives as RNG took Infernal Soul point and mid-lane tier one tower. Shortly after this, at 20 minutes, DK once again find a play in the top lane after Heo “<strong>ShowMaker</strong>” Su solo kills Li “<strong>Xiaohu</strong>” Yuan-Hao. This gives DK the green light to utilise their numbers advantage in the mid lane and look for a fight. This goes poorly, as RNG turned it around.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Nearly three minutes later, Xiaohu finds the picture-perfect Gragas engage onto Canyon. A body slam plus cask combo was all that was needed to get RNG a two for zero and an Infernal buff. DK would later punch back at the 25-minute mark; although this fight started with no team biting the bullet, it ultimately concluded with DK getting a three for one team fight win. This meant that Baron was on the menu for DK, but a crucial pick from RNG’s Yuan “<strong>Cryin</strong>” Cheng-Wei stopped that in its tracks. </p>
<p>The closeness continued in the next team fight at 30 minutes for Elder Dragon. It had RNG’s Chen “<strong>GALA</strong>” Wei jump into the dragon pit and steal the buff. But in the end, Jang “<strong>Ghost</strong>” Yong-jun and Kim “<strong>Khan</strong>” Dong-ha lived to clean up the fight in DK’s favour. This didn’t discourage RNG, though, as they made the call to decisively take down Baron before DK could even act; this nets RNG the mid-lane inhibitor and eventually the game. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/ObliviousFrozenLEDLitty-JguHC6rqdN4VSdnP?tt_content=url&amp;tt_medium=clips_api" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>RNG took the lead early on in game two after a botched Herald attempt from DK. Although it seemed like a good start to the fight for DK, RNG still turned it around. RNG dogpiled onto a flashless Ghost, eventually cleaning up the fight and took the buff. This put DK down early. </p>
<p>Even in a big hole early in the game, DK managed to slowly claw back into the game with a number of plays. This all culminated with DK coming back to parody. Past this, RNG went for the third dragon, but ShowMaker steals it. This prompted a forced engagement from RNG with Shi “<strong>Ming</strong>” Sen-Ming, but DK had a great disengage. It ended up in a two for zero in favour of DK as well as a mid lane tower take.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>A few minutes later, with the lead that RNG had built up gone, DK went on the offensive. At the fourth dragon fight, DK get the perfect fight getting two kills and their second dragon of the game. This was quickly followed up by a Baron take in which RNG went to contest but ultimately conga lined to their deaths. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/BeautifulCloudyArtichokeBrokeBack-iFnzp3OECaI4_NxD?tt_content=url&amp;tt_medium=clips_api" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>This just broke the game wide open for DK; an insurmountable lead, a Baron buff, and a fed Tristana was all that DK needed to win the game.</p>
<p>Slower paced gameplay for game three, devoid of a huge explosive start. ShowMaker set the tone early, preventing a gank onto himself as well as preventing a gank onto Khan right after. Following this, DK get their first First Blood of the series with a gank from Canyon onto the bottom lane -- for the first time in the series, DK had a comfortable lead. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>At 17 minutes, RNG start the third dragon, and DK respond with a contest. The fight started off with GALA being sectioned off by a Khan Nocturne ultimate, but RNG’s superb team fighting came to the forefront. A good layering of CC from the Gnar and Leona helped them win the fight and get them their first dragon. </p>
<p>Then at the 24-minute mark, DK find the fight that gets them a pick onto Yan “<strong>Wei</strong>” Yang-Wei. With that pick in hand, they go for Baron. Even with a numbers advantage, DK was still refusing to turn on RNG’s contest; they stacked up behind the Baron. This sort of funnel created from Baron’s back spikes as well as RNG’s damage costed DK greatly. This gave a huge team fight win over to RNG as well as the Baron buff. After a reset, they went and got their second dragon.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/CogentAgitatedStarlingCclamChamp-uNcSDRleqeinQcZW?tt_content=url&amp;tt_medium=clips_api" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>What was once a DK game for the first time this series, was turned on its head in favour of RNG.</p>
<p>At 31 minutes, RNG find an engage onto DK that gets them a pick onto Canyon while having Wei narrowly live — this gives them Baron. In return for the Baron take, DK get soul point. Finally, with Baron buff in hand a huge play from GALA, RNG put themselves on match point after taking the base. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/AmericanObliviousPheasantDAESuppy-78p-I3D5vq1TDOpb?tt_content=url&amp;tt_medium=clips_api" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>For game four, DK decided to heavily favour the top side while RNG went for a slow slowball. This was DK’s most dominant game in all of the series, full control from start to finish. All to be topped off by a Ghost pentakill on the Tristana. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/ClumsyFamousBunnyPipeHype-_gEkGDA-qw4Bvf0a?tt_content=url&amp;tt_medium=clips_api" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>Lastly, in game five, RNG respond to DK’s dominating game four with a dominant game of their own. This time around, it was even more dominant. It took just three unanswered kills in the early game for them to take complete control of the game. A ten thousand gold lead 24 minutes in, and the dominant team fight win after team fight win; RNG came to play, and they had the wallets to do it. </p>
<p>RNG crowned themselves this year's MSI champions.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Griefing is an issue across many games, but it’s especially problematic in a battle royale like <em><a href="/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></em>.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p><em>Fortnite</em> as a whole is just prime for griefers. The game’s genre, the <a href="/guides/how-old-do-you-have-to-be-to-play-fortnite/" title="How Old Do You Have To Be To Play Fortnite?" data-anchor="#">average age</a> of the competitors, and the <a href="/guides/fortnite-lan-tournaments/">massive prize pools</a> all work together to create a recipe for disaster. The pressure and spotlight these young players have on them can fuel some truly <a href="/articles/does-the-fortnite-community-need-a-time-out/">abhorrent and toxic behaviour</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve probably heard the term griefing before, but what exactly does it mean to grief or be griefed in <em>Fortnite</em>?</p>
<p><img src="/media/f1pjizel/fortnite-crying.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="fortnite-what-is-griefing" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>What Is Griefing?</h2>
<p>The definition of griefing is somewhat ambiguous. At its core, griefing is an act performed by one player to harass or disrupt the game of another player. Think trolling, but more spiteful.</p>
<p>Basically, any action performed by a player that is to the determinant of both themself and the enemy player can fall under the umbrella of griefing. Rather than playing for one’s own best interest, a griefer will act with the intent to ruin someone else’s game.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>How Many Forms Of Griefing are There?</h2>
<p>The most prominent form of griefing in competitive <em>Fortnite</em> involves a losing player intentionally ruining a match for someone on top of a tournament’s leaderboard. Typically, the griefing player’s tournament is over. They haven’t performed up to their expectations and they no longer have a chance to win. So instead of taking their loss in stride, they go out of their way to sabotage another player.</p>
<p>This process usually involves the griefer dropping on top of the player they are trying to grief. The griefer may have been landing at a different location all tournament, and then suddenly they’ll change their drop spot to the same point of interest (POI) as another participant. The griefer does not care if they die because their own tournament is over anyway. Their sole mission is to eliminate their target, and ruin that player’s tournament standing.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Other minor forms of griefing include stuff like Storm fighting and kamikaze attacks on enemies with explosives. Most <em>Fortnite</em> players have probably had an opponent relentlessly chase them into the Storm. Griefers will pursue a kill endlessly, even if it ends with both parties dying. Finishing a kill is one thing, but chasing someone deep into the Storm to the detriment of one’s self is griefing.</p>
<p>Shooting an RPG at the ground to kill both you and another player could be considered griefing. You knew the RPG was going to kill you, but you didn’t care. If you're dying, you are going to take an enemy with you. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>These minor forms of griefing are not exclusive to <em>Fortnite</em> tournaments. Even casual players have likely run into this sort of griefing.</p>

</div>
<h2>Historic Examples Of Griefing</h2>
<p>The most recent example of griefing in a major <em>Fortnite</em> event occurred just a few days ago. An Australian pro by the name of LunR was in first place heading into the final match of the FNCS All-Star Showdown Solo Grand Finals. Another player, RIVLEE_, decided it was time to make LunR the target of a grief attempt.</p>
<p>RIVLEE_ followed LunR to Stealthy Stronghold and eliminated LunR off spawn, effectively ending LunR’s chances at first-place. RIVLEE_ had not visited Stealthy Stronghold a single time the whole tournament. It was only once RIVLEE_’s tournament hopes were squandered that he decided to contest LunR.</p>

<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>There’s no debating that this sequence was intentional. RIVLEE_ himself even took to Twitter to take responsibility for his actions. RIVLEE_ admits to griefing LunR, claiming that he was peer pressured by other players.</p>

<p>One of the most famous incidents of griefing in <em>Fortnite</em> history occurred between Dominick <strong>“Unknown”</strong> Green and Cody <strong>“<a href="/articles/fortnite-professional-clix-unbanned-amid-freeclix-movement/" title="Fortnite Professional Clix Unbanned Amid #FreeClix Movement ">Clix</a>”</strong> Conrad. Both of these competitors have prestigious resumes, so their beef obviously drew a lot of attention.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>It all started when Clix eliminated Unknown in the Chapter 2 - Season 2 FNCS Invitational. Clix got a little rowdy after the kill and performed an emote on Unknown’s corpse. This triggered Unknown, who stated afterwards that he would go for revenge on Clix in the next match.</p>
<p>Unknown followed through on his promise and followed Clix to Pleasant Park. Luckily for Clix, he got word of Unknown’s plans prior to the match and was able to avoid the sabotage attempt. Still, this did not deter Unknown. The vengeful controller pro swore to hunt down Clix again in the next match.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/ClixHimself/status/1264343150623154177?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360">

</div>
<p>As one may expect, Clix did not take Unknown’s attempts to grief him well. Clix booted up a live stream to vent his frustrations.  Clix stated, “this is a million-dollar tournament… first place is $100K. I'm in the top 15 going into the last game.” Clix carried on, “just cause I sniped this kid and danced as a joke... he has 30,000 viewers, and he’s teaching the kids that watch that it’s okay to cheat.”</p>
<p>After much online deliberation between the two parties, Unknown acknowledged the error of his ways and did not follow through on a second attempt to grief Clix. Still, the rivalry started a rift through the <em>Fortnite</em> community...</p>

<h2>Pros And Content Creators Speak Out On Griefing</h2>
<p>The prevalence of griefing in competitive <em>Fortnite</em> has sparked quite a discussion across the gaming community. Household names such as <a href="/streamers/ninja/">Tyler <strong>“Ninja”</strong> Blevins</a> and Jaryd <strong>"Summit1g" </strong>Lazar have taken to Twitter to voice their opinions on the matter.</p>
<p>Ninja released a short video to Twitter calling out the griefers. In it, Ninja states, “don’t grief players, because your tournament is over. Don’t land somewhere else and try to ruin someone else’s tournament because you choked or sucked, and now can’t qualify.”</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Ninja expresses the need for <em>Fortnite</em> competitors to show some empathy for one another. “You don’t even know what you’re doing. What if this person needs this money? Like, you don’t know what they’re going through, what their family is going through, especially in a time like this man. People aren’t even comprehending that.”</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Ninja/status/1264366016181817347?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360">

</div>
<p>Ninja’s statement could not be any more appropriate considering the reaction we saw from LunR, the most recent victim of a public griefing scandal. LuhR brokedown on stream after the incident, discussing the affair while openly crying. The actions of one immature player cost LunR thousands of dollars along with his emotional wellbeing.</p>

</div>
<p><a href="/articles/summit1g-explodes-into-epic-rant/" title="Summit1g Explodes Into Epic Rant While Playing Tense Game Of Rust">Summit1g</a> took on the role of Devil’s advocate in the griefing debate. Speaking in regards to the Unknown vs. Clix situation, Summit1g asked the question: "So if I'm playing <em>Fornite</em> in an event. Someone kills me and dances on my body. I get heated and happen to know their preferred landing locations. I'm not allowed to go after him in the next round?" Actions some see as griefing, Summit1g simply sees as part of the game.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/summit1g/status/1264687506194194433?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<h2>Is Griefing Illegal?</h2>
<p>Everyone has their opinions, but Epic Games is the final judge and jury. And so far, it seems like they hold Summit1g’s view on griefing.</p>
<p>Griefing is technically not against the rules. If a participant does not flat-out admit to griefing, it is near impossible to prove or enforce.</p>
<p><a href="/articles/falls-guys-has-just-been-bought-by-epic-games/" title="Fall Guys Has Just Been Bought By Epic Games">Epic Games</a> would probably rather witness suspected griefing than the opposite. Epic Games has taken a firm stance on collusion, including actions like planned movement. This includes agreements by opposing players to avoid landing away from one another. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>In Epic’s eyes, contested drops are just part of the game. As tournament administrators, Epic cannot punish participants for where they land. This type of griefing is just an unfortunate side effect of competitive play in the battle royale genre.</p>
<p>In the end, griefing is not officially against the rules, but it’s an extremely frowned upon act. Competitors usually abide by the unwritten rule not to grief one another. However, there’s always the chance that a rogue villain will appear and break this player code.</p>
<p>No one likes to be griefed, but due to the nature of <em>Fortnite</em> and video games in general, the toxic act is here to stay. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Off the back of the <a href="/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></a> and <em>Warzone </em>Season 2 update, two brand-new weapons were added to the mix, offering even more diversity to Verdansk. Both the FARA 83 and the LC10 were added, with the former being a new rendition of the <em>Black Ops</em> classic AR: the Galil.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>The FARA 83, unlike its cousin that is the AMAX, boasts a much more similar build to the Galil, with an elongated body and a very horizontal overall style, perfect for precision.</p>
<p>After being a deadly force up-close in Season 3, replacing an <a href="/guides/best-smg-warzone-season-4/" title="What Are The Best SMGs In Warzone Season 4?">SMG</a> in most player's arsenal, the FARA 83 now poses a bigger threat in <a href="/guides/warzone-season-4-release-date-leaks-maps-weapons-zombies/" title="Warzone Season 4 Release Date, Leaks, Maps, Weapons, Zombies">Season 4</a> - as a long-ranged AR.</p>
<p>With many different ways to kit out your new Assault Rifle, we have you covered with a guide to the best long-range FARA 83 Warzone loadout attachments.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>BEST Long Range FARA 83 WARZONE LOADOUT ATTACHMENTS</h2>
<p>With an infinite amount of combinations, the best attachments come after levelling this AR up quite high. With the FARA 83, you will want to reduce its recoil as much as possible, as in <em>Warzone </em>it does come with a bit of kick. With that in mind, this blend of FARA 83 <em>Warzone</em> loadout attachments fully optimise the weapon to become a seriously contentious meta weapon.</p>
<p><img src="/media/ft5j5hd3/microsoftteams-image-12.png?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Long-Range FARA Warzone Loadout" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="" /></p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Muzzle - GRU Suppressor</li>
<li>Barrel - 19.5" Liberator</li>
<li>Underbarrel - Spetsnaz Grip</li>
<li>Ammunition - VDV 60 RND Fast Mag</li>
<li>Optic - Axial Arms 3x</li>
</ul>
<p>For most builds in <em>Warzone</em>, the GRU Suppressor is a fan-favourite, excelling in both damage range and secrecy by keeping you off the radar. The Liberator grip is the most effective for distanced gunfights, adding to its range and velocity.</p>
<p>After the Bruiser Grip's secret recoil control stats were nerfed, the Spetsnaz Grip has become popular for the FARA 83, with it reducing both vertical and horizontal recoil.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The final attachment is where this loadout is open to interpretation, although with its particular combat range this is the most effective. Most ARs come with reasonable iron sights, but for a more accurate shot, the Axial Arms 3x optic will contribute ten-fold.</p>
<p>A 2x magnification also works, although anything more than the 3x will have you struggling later in the game. The Axial Arms 3x is your best bet for a long-distance FARA 83.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2 class="editorH2">BEST FARA 83 WARZONE LOADOUT PERKS</h2>
<p>As per your <em>Warzone</em> stylistic this section is interchangeable, however, if this is from your first loadout of the match then this is what we'd recommend as your best FARA 83 <em>Warzone </em>loadout perk selection.</p>
<p><img src="/media/jkphz1af/microsoftteams-image-13.png?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Long-Range FARA Warzone Loadout" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary - SMG (<a href="/guides/black-ops-mp5-warzone-loadout-attachments/" title="The Best Black Ops MP5 Warzone Loadout Attachments">MP5</a>)</li>
<li>Perk 1 - Double Time</li>
<li>Perk 2 - Overkill</li>
<li>Perk 3 - Amped</li>
<li>Lethal - Throwing Knife</li>
<li>Tactical - Flash Grenade</li>
</ul>
<p>Amped is one of the more crucial perks to your FARA 83 <em>Warzone</em> loadout, with the likelihood that you'll be using a slightly faster secondary such as an SMG - this will allow for a quicker swap, and you can send a Throwing Knife flying in an instance to finish off a kill.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Should you have another weapon already equipped, Overkill can be easily substituted for Ghost. With it being favourable up close similar to the FFAR, Double Time works best for your FARA 83 <em>Warzone </em>loadout, to dart in and out of danger and slay your way through Verdansk.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It might seem from first glance that esports is a young man’s game, with so many players just scraping out of their teens performing in some of the biggest esports leagues on the planet. But, this couldn’t be further from the truth - while of course many of the grandest players in the top leagues are quite young, that doesn’t mean that competitive gaming is exclusively for the young.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>In fact, it makes more sense to be playing video games more competitively if you were around when they were first introduced, right? These are the competitive gamers who are bending stereotypes of how old players can be to be deemed an esports player.</p>
<h2>Who Is The Oldest Esports Player?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/pzcfn55a/diehardbirdie.jpg?width=500&amp;height=280.94059405940595" alt="Which Esports Player Is The Oldest?" width="500" height="280.94059405940595" data-caption="DirHardBirdie"></p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The man who is regarded as the oldest esports player in the world is Abbe Drakborg, known online as ‘DieHardBirdie’, a famous <a href="/counter-strike/" title="CS:GO"><em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive </em></a>player who picked up the game after he retired. He’s 78 years old, and keeps himself busy in retirement by streaming on Twitch, and is described in his Twitter bio as “esports’ oldest world champion”.</p>
<p>He’s earned quite a name for himself, even appearing on Prime Video’s <em>Gamebreakers </em>documentary series and flying the flag for older gamers everywhere. He earned his title of DieHardBirdie because he has “time to kill”, and he’s notorious for whistling after he scores kills in the game.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>He’s entered the ring of esports by joining the Silver Snipers team, the first professional senior <em>CS:GO </em>team in the world, who won the Dreamhack Senior League competition. In terms of age, Drakborg is also tied with fellow Senior Snipers' member Öivind “<strong>Windy</strong>” Toverund, a “vicious” <em>CS:GO </em>player.</p>
<p>Abbe is an icon of competitive <em>CS:GO</em> and is proof that esports isn’t just for the young. Keep an eye on the Silver Snipers too - they could be next to dominate the leaderboards of the next <em>Counter Strike </em>league.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Felix "<a rel="noopener" href="/streamers/xqc/" target="_blank" title="XQC"><strong>xQc</strong></a>" Lengyel is not only known as one of the <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/xqc-remains-most-watched-twitch-streamer-in-2021/" target="_blank" title="xQc Remains Most-Watched Twitch Streamer In 2021">most popular streamers around</a>, but as one of the mouthiest. We know the Canadian content creating superstar can hold his own, xQc has revealed he's been subjected to daily raids from the police. Things are so bad, xQc has apparently had to move out of his home.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>The likes of xQc and other big names like Imane "<a rel="noopener" href="/streamers/pokimane/" target="_blank" title="Pokimane"><strong>Pokimane</strong></a>" Anys, Tyler "<a rel="noopener" href="/streamers/ninja/" target="_blank" title="Ninja"><strong>Ninja</strong></a>" Blevins, and Nick "<a rel="noopener" href="/streamers/nickmercs/" target="_blank" title="NickMercs"><strong>NICKMERCS</strong></a>" Kolcheff intentionally put themselves in the limelight, but just like any celebrity, there's an argument they have a right to a private life.</p>
<p>It seems xQc's notoriety has gotten the better of him, with his home being subjected to multiple police raids. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Why has xQc had to move?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://clips.twitch.tv/HomelyBeautifulDragonfruitOptimizePrime-rZBzCk0-OolKxJE3?tt_content=url&amp;tt_medium=clips_api" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>Discussing the reasons behind a potential move back to Canada, xQc admitted, "The main reason why I wanted to move back to Canada a month ago, we were getting raided by the police station at rates that absolutely made no f*****g sense. Almost every day the police came to our house with the full squad. Because of f*****g idiots. I was genuinely scared that I was GOING to die". </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Although xQc didn't reveal what happened next, he said things got "way worse" and prompted him to seriously consider packing his bags. “It didn’t make sense to me", said Lengyel. "I just got so scared I just wanted to go home. I just wanted to go back to Canada. And then some other stuff happened that was worse, way worse, and I was just like I want to get the f**k out of here". </p>
<p>The reveal just comes after leaked DMs between xQc and Tyler "<strong>Trainwrecks</strong>" Niknam hinted Lengyel could move back to Canada in the midst of gambling sponsorship drama. xQc is keen to distance himself from any idea that gambling streams could see him move home - instead reiterating he's been having a tough time. </p>
<p>Lengyel said he didn't want to be branded a "victim", however allegations he was moving back to Canada for gambling gains put his "back against the wall". He's decided to come clean with his ever-growing fan base.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>How did xQc cover up his police raids?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/feralision/status/1409566699758800905?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360">
<p dir="ltr">this whole xqc house raid makes me so sad to hear hopefully everything is okay soon</p>
— giselle (@feralision) <a href="https://twitter.com/feralision/status/1409566699758800905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div>
<p>For sceptics questioning when these multiple raids took place, it turns out xQc had a novel way of hiding them from his viewers. Lengyel continued, "The police here are very professional. After the first raid, they would give us a heads up, and they would clear the house. And I found a way to remain on stream and not say anything at all. And nobody ever noticed, and the streams kept on going". </p>
<p>Apparently, his cue was looking off-screen and mentioning food. xQc clarified, "Any time I looked to my left, and I was like 'the food, yeah,' sometimes there were full f*****g police squads in my house". So there you have it, xQc's not-so-secret police raids have been exposed.</p>
<p>There were already questions when Lengyel moved in with Chance "<strong>Sodapoppin</strong>" Morris earlier this month. Although xQc brushed it off as "house renovations", it became more suspicious that he was battling something in real life. Now, it looks like we've got to the bottom of the mystery. It's unclear whether xQc still plans on moving back to Canada, however, he seems to be coping okay in Texas right now.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>There’s an heir to the throne that the AMAX left behind in the kingdom of <em><a href="/guides/warzone-season-4-release-date-leaks-maps-weapons-zombies/">Warzone</a></em> after it got continuously bobbed by nerfs. While a lot of players are looking towards the <a href="/guides/best-fara-83-warzone-loadout-attachments/">FARA 83</a>, there’s one weapon that appears to do a lot better by eye test, feel, and statistics. The C58 is likely to be the best primary weapon currently in the game and, together with the Cold War MP5, should at least statistically be played as the predominant meta loadout in <em>Warzone</em> at the end of June. That said, you rarely meet it on the battlefield, giving players who are early to the C58 train a real advantage.</p>

<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<h2>How do you unlock the C58?</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the reasons why the C58 isn’t in everyone’s hands right now is the relatively late unlock into the battle pass. Much like the <a href="/guides/mg82-best-attachment-guide-post-nerf/">MG82,</a> which unlocks at level 15, the C58 also is a battle pass weapon that unlocks at level 31. It’s also part of the floor loot table, so you should have some weapon progression done by the time you unlock the weapon. Even with just the early attachments, it’s pretty decent immediately, making it a relatively painless gun to level up.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>The Best C58 Warzone Attachments</h2>
<p>Much like with other guns, the C58 leaves you some options based on the queue size you go into, mainly around the size of your mag. Moreover, multiple scopes are feasible on it, as the effective range on the gun both lends itself to 3x and 4x scopes. With that said, here’s what the best players using the gun are currently playing.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p><strong>Optic:</strong> Royal &amp; Kross 4x / Axial Arms 3x</p>
<p><strong>Barrel:</strong> 18.5’’ Task Force<br /><br /><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Agency Suppressor</p>
<p><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Field Agent Grip</p>
<p><strong>Ammunition:</strong> 45 Rnd Drum / STANAG 55 Rnd</p>
<p>This setup beams opponents at usual AR ranges and has very similar applications to the one the AMAX once occupied. Most players who apply the C58 successfully appear to be running the AR with a capable SMG such as the <em>Cold War</em> <a href="/guides/best-mp5-class-cold-war/">MP5</a> to cover most effective ranges you will regularly encounter on the Warzone map layout, especially when avoiding long-range sniper fights. With that SMG + C58 combination, you stay agile in gunfights unlike MG83 setups otherwise would. From our experience, 45 Rounds are enough or at least two opponents, though three is possible. In quads, you may want to substitute the STANAG 55 Rnd to reliably be able to take three out while having the potential for a fourth one if you hit a streak.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>It’s highly possible that the C58 will receive similar nerfs as the AMAX did, so use it while you can and up in the rotation. While the FARA is all the rage right now, the C58 appears to be a sleeper pick that’s even better and is likely to take over for the FARA once it’s inevitably nerfed.</p>

<p>A<a href="/guides/apex-legends-ranked-predator/" title="How To Become An Apex Predator"> minimum of 72 games is required to become an Apex Predator</a>, although that seems a hefty feat when you realise that you'd have to win each of those with 5 kills. The average <em>Apex Legends</em> Predator (the top 500 in Ranked) will have to play approximately 200 games to enter the elite echelon, meaning a large chunk of players reside in Masters and below.</p>

<h2>Apex Legends Pros and Streamers Beg Respawn To Tackle Cheaters With #SaveApexRanked</h2>
<p>Taking to a TwitLonger titled "Empty Promises and False Hope", NRG content creator Chris "<strong>sweetdreams</strong>" Sexton has hit out at the Apex Legends dev team, claiming consecutive months of no efforts to tackle cheaters and 'ddosing' is ruining their ranked gameplay.</p>
<p>Within the rant, sweetdreams said: "Streamers ability to consistently make content while playing ranked, and the general quality of life of anyone who plays ranked at a high level across any region has been declining and fast.</p>
<p>"This issue stems from <em>Apex Legend's</em> general lack of enthusiasm when it comes to hiring or acquiring more people who can serve to ban cheaters either real-time (preferred) or after the fact (still decent)."<span> </span></p>

<h2>Respawn Entertainment Respond To #SaveApexRanked </h2>
<p>Respawn Entertainment's team have often been transparent in their opinions on the game, and have continued that trend. Ryan Rigney, Director of Communications at Respawn, was the first to respond, voicing support for the #SaveApexRanked campaign - although he was upset by some of the attacks on the devs.</p>
<p>Rigney tweeted: "There are very valid complaints in here - we've got to crack down on the cheating and make real progress. Actions are needed, not just words."</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you like blasting demon butts, there are few in the video game industry that do it as well as id Software. Known for its work on the OG <em>Wolfenstein</em>, <a href="/articles/female-quake-reboot/" title="Quake Reboot Will Reportedly Feature Female Lead"><em>Quake</em></a>, and <em>DOOM</em> games, id has sat comfortably under a great gaming umbrella alongside the like of <em>Fallout</em> and <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>With <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/microsoft-s-acquisition-of-zenimax-has-huge-implications-for-gaming/" target="_blank" title="Microsoft’s Acquisition Of ZeniMax Has Huge Implications For Gaming">Microsoft's recent acquisition of ZeniMax Media</a>, it means Bethesda, id, MachineGames, Arkane, and all the rest are looking ahead at a future with Xbox. While this year's <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/buy-xbox-after-e3/" target="_blank" title="You'd Be Foolish Not To Buy An Xbox After E3">E3 was a runaway success for Microsoft</a>, some studios were relatively quiet with what it's working on. Now, it sounds like an untitled id Software project could be on the way.</p>
<h2>What is the untitled id Software project?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/1409731781654368264?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360">
<p dir="ltr">BREAKING<br /><br />The Australian Rating Board has published a rating for an id Software title codenamed "2021B." This is rated far lower than any previous id product.<br /><br />This title is stated to have "online interactivity."<br /><br />/thread <a href="https://t.co/Z70qqBJWTN">pic.twitter.com/Z70qqBJWTN</a></p>
— Tyler McVicker (@Tyler_McV) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/1409731781654368264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div>
<p>As noted by numerous outlets, a currently untitled id Software project - using the codename Project 2021B - has been classified by the Australian Classification Board. There isn't much to go on, other than the fact Project 2021B is rated M for "violence" and "online interactivity". It's all pretty standard id fodder for the studio. Elsewhere, the untitled id Software project is confirmed as a multiplatform "computer game" that will be published by ZeniMax Europe. This suggests it won't be a VR port of a previous title. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Interestingly, this is the same board that revealed Project 2021A in January. This teaser spoiled the reveal of <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/doom-3-vr/" target="_blank" title="PlayStation Delivers Surprise Reveal Of DOOM 3 VR Remaster"><em>DOOM 3</em> on PSVR ahead of time</a>. The fact the latest entry is named in a similar fashion means it could be something else set in the <em>DOOM</em> subfranchise. Then again, we have our own theories. </p>
<p>Further distancing Project 2021B from <em>DOOM 3</em> in PSVR, remember the VR port was rated R18+ for "high impact violence". This is a whole two levels of violence higher than Project 2021B's Mature rating. Given that <em>DOOM</em> is known as one of the goriest franchises out there, the implication is that this mysterious game won't have you chainsawing demons from Mars in half.</p>

</div>
<p>The general consensus is that this is the long-rumoured <em>Quake</em> revival we've been hearing about. Only recently, we covered the news that <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/female-quake-reboot/" target="_blank" title="Quake Reboot Will Reportedly Feature Female Lead">id Software is tipped to return to <em>Quake</em></a>. Although this was reported to be a reboot of the long-running series that would swap the lead for a female protagonist, others think Project 2021B is a "remasterered collection" for <em>Quake</em>. </p>
<p>While the first <em>Quake</em> came out in 1996, the franchise has since spun out to have four main series entries and various spin-offs. It's easy to imagine a <em>Quake</em> quadrilogy, or at least a remastered trilogy of the first three games. Others have suggested it could be something set within the world of <em>Wolfenstein</em>, but given that id has long since handed over the reins of B.J. Blazkowicz to MachineGames, it seems highly unlikely.</p>
<p>E3 might bill itself as the gaming event of the year where all the big announcements, but alongside Sega's recent Sonic showcase and reports of a Sony State of Play, it's likely id is saving a big announcement for a later date. Remembering that QuakeCon is coming in August, we're guessing this is when the untitled id Software project will get its time to shine. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="/xbox/">Xbox</a> Game Pass has been identified as one of the most limitless ways to experience gaming, even without the prospect of playing anywhere. The subscription service offers players a wall of games that’d seem near-impossible to finish even for the most seasoned of gamers, and all of them are available to download whenever you like. There's even more goodies to claim when using the pass too, like the <a href="/articles/xbox-game-pass-users-can-get-30-days-of-disney-plus-for-free/">30 days of free Disney+</a> that Xbox recently offered users.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Not only that, but many of these games stretch both to the PC, and to mobile with the use of the cloud. Once upon a time, this was only available for Android users, but now, the cloud has spread vastly, and has changed the way that games can be played on mobile and PC.</p>
<h2>Xbox Cloud Gaming Available To Everyone On Xbox Game Pass</h2>
<p><img src="/media/rvqjomfk/xbox-cloud-gaming-2.jpg?width=500&amp;height=312.5" alt="Cloud Gaming Now Available On PC And Apple" width="500" height="312.5" data-caption="Xbox"></p>
<p>The cloud has evolved, and can now allow Game Pass users to play games from their Apple products, and now PC players can make use of the cloud by streaming their games rather than using their hardware to run games. </p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass’ evolution has now offered even more ways to play, whether it be on the go or on limited hardware, expanding its potential player-base hugely. If you’re a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, you can now play games on the cloud on PC and Apple devices, as well as the previously established Android devices. Supported web browsers also include the potential to run games on desktop, if you didn’t fancy downloading the app.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Streaming quality will remain at 1080p and have a framerate cap of 60fps, but considering the lack of hardware required to play, this seems like a fair trade-off.</p>
<p>Cloud on the PC will also be limited to Windows 10 PCs, which will change when the recently-announced Windows 11 comes around.</p>
<p>This change has opened the possibilities of the Game Pass, and will no doubt catch the eye of players without any impressive hardware. If your PC isn’t very gaming-oriented, and you’ve been meaning to get into PC gaming anyway, this might be a good place to start.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Great Britain has its fair share of icons. The cuppa, the Queen, the big red bus - all figureheads of our great isle. But none quite exemplify our culture quite like a good sausage roll. Greggs is a crucial part of our social consciousness, bleeding into our society as the place to get a solid sossy roll, or a fallback for a quick breakfast.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>It would seem that gamers agree too, as one player has put themselves to work immortalising the bakery by adapting it to the world of <em>Far Cry 5</em>.</p>
<h2>Player Recreates Greggs In Far Cry 5</h2>
<p>YouTube creator Mojo Swoptops has been hard at work bringing the UK’s greatest achievement to the world of video games. They have used the game’s arcade mode to bring the bakery to life, and we have to say, it’s remarkably accurate.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first time we’ve seen genius adaptations in the <em>Far Cry 5 </em>arcade mode - <a href="/articles/goldeneye-007-far-cry-5/">one fan even built <em>Goldeneye 007 </em>from the ground up</a> in the world-builder.</p>
<p><img src="/media/lguju1mc/arcade.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Player Builds Greggs In Far Cry 5" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="Ubisoft"></p>
<p>Mojo Swoptops nails pretty much every element of Greggs that makes it so iconic. The fridges along the sides and heaters in front of the desk are a familiar site for the inhabitants of the UK, and while the world builder might not have literal sausage rolls at its disposal, the creator makes do with burgers, breakfast muffins and baskets of fruit in their place.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>They even hit the nail on the head with the sign out in front, with those four little orange squares welcoming the player into the bakery. The creator even works on the outside of the bakery, really nailing its vibe, with rubbish littering the floor and an unconscious man with a bottle in his hand just outside. That’s the Greggs we know.</p>
<p>You can check out the full video here:</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/112TZpgluCk" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>The <em>Far Cry 5 </em>world builder looks like a whopper of a tool, and we’ve got our fingers crossed we’ll see some more icons of the British high street adapted in-game. We’ll be waiting patiently for the <em>Far Cry </em>interpretation of a WH Smith’s.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>The Boys</em> are back in town, as Amazon's foul-mouthed superhero series could be about to take flight in a whole new way. While the live-action adaptation of Garth Ennis and Darick Robertson's comic series has become one of the streaming service's big hitters, the ever-expanding world of these spandex-clad douchebags has teased an entry into the world of video games.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Although the boom in superhero movies and shows that was arguably kick-started by the likes of <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Spider-Man</em> in the early '00s, it really took off with the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2008.</p>
<p>With <em>The Boys</em> being a not-so-subtle riff on the Justice League and Avengers, mixing that concept with X-rated scenes of head-popping vaginas and exploding whales means <em>The Boys</em> has seen great success.</p>

<p>As fans sit and wait patiently for the upcoming Season 3 of <em>The Boys</em>, the show's official Twitter account sent tongues wagging with a simple tweet that read, "But what would a The Boys video game look like?" It's a long way off actual confirmation of <em>The Boys</em> video game, however, that didn't stop the idea taking off like Homelander himself.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">

<p>On happy gamer suggested that Naughty Dog, Insomniac, or Rockstar make this mythical <em>The Boys</em> video game. While Naughty Dog is known for the brutal world of <a rel="noopener" href="/the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" title="The Last of Us"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>, Insomniac has swung into our lives with <em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em> to give Rocksteady's <em>Arkham</em> games a run for their money. Out of the bunch, the idea of Rockstar tackling <em>The Boys</em> is arguably the most tempting. Given its runaway success with <a rel="noopener" href="/red-dead/" target="_blank" title="Red Dead"><em>Red Dead</em></a>, <a rel="noopener" href="/gta/" target="_blank" title="GTA"><em>GTA</em></a>, and <em>Bully</em>, it has <em>The Boys </em>written all over it.</p>
<h2>Do the cast of The Boys want a video game?</h2>

<p>In terms of how a video game version of <em>The Boys</em> would play out, the thread threw up ideas that suggested everything from a <em>Mortal Kombat</em>-inspired beat 'em up to an open-world spectacular in the vein of <em>Spider-Man</em>. It's easy to imagine an open-world game where you get play as various members of The Seven or even the Supe-kicking members of The Boys, but would this be overkill? We've already seen Crystal Dynamics struggle with the divisive <em>Marvel's Avengers</em>. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Still, superhero games are everywhere right now and show no signs of slowing down. Alongside WB Montreal's <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/gotham-knights-superman/" target="_blank" title="Gotham Knights Team Reportedly Working On Superman Game"><em>Gotham Knights</em> and rumours of a <em>Superman</em> game</a>, Square Enix is busy with <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> and the <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/guardians-of-the-galaxy-fans-furious-at-new-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" title="Guardians Of The Galaxy Fans Furious At New Gameplay Footage">recently announced <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a>. If that wasn't enough, Rocksteady has <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> and <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/insomniac-spider-man-2/" target="_blank" title="Insomniac Teases Marvel's Spider-Man 2">Insomniac is presumably hard at work on <em>Spider-Man 2</em></a>. <em>The Boys </em>could bring something new to the table by combining all of the above with the show and comics' X-rated style.</p>
<p>Ironically, the idea of <em>The Boys</em> getting a video game was floated by actor Jack Quaid (Hughie Campbell) last year. Speaking to <a rel="noopener" href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/jack-quaid-reveals-what-he-wants-in-a-video-game-of-the-boys/" target="_blank">Comicbook.com</a>, Quaid said, "I think I would turn to a video game only because there are... Okay. Let's just assume you could play as anybody. That's like so many different types of game wrapped into one. You can play as, essentially, Superman or you can play as one of us grunts on the ground and make it like a first-person shooter. There's just a lot of stuff you could do for the Boys."</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>He added, "I think you could make many different games out of The Boys franchise, because there's a game you can make it all about A-Train, you can make it all about The Boys and make it like a tactical, first-person shooter, third-person shooter type of thing. There's a lot of potential there, and it'd be cool as a tabletop RPG, too, but I just think the different kinds of gameplay you could get from a video game would be really cool....Get the guys that did Arkham Asylum, Arkham City, and all that stuff. Get them. Yes."</p>
<p>While we wait patiently for any official word on <em>The Boys</em> getting its own video game, we'll continue to dream up ideas that would undoubtedly give the franchise a licence to print money. We say, get this idea going quicker than A-Train. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>A Sonic the Hedgehog skin has a certain "ring" to it. Swapping the Green Hill Zone for Pleasant Park, Sonic the Hedgehog could be getting ready to spin his way into <a rel="noopener" href="/fortnite/" target="_blank" title="Fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a>.

<p>For those of us who are of a certain age, we'll be feeling our mortality that Sonic the Hedgehog officially turns 30 this year. Following in the footsteps of Zelda's 35th celebrations and Pokemon's 25th for Nintendo, Sega is making sure its mascot gets his time to shine.</p>
<p>If <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/sonic-mania-free/" target="_blank" title="Gamers Can Grab Sonic Mania For Free">picking up <em>Sonic Mania</em> for absolutely nothing</a> wasn't enough, how about playing as Sonic in <em>Fortnite</em>?</p>

<p>In typical <em>Fortnite</em> style, there's a lot of speculation and datamining. This time, noted leaker HYPEX posted on Twitter and pointed to "an unreleased contrail for a skin codenamed Sonic". It would seem strange to use a placeholder for something so specific and NOT have it related to Sonic the Hedgehog, but you never know.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>HYPEX dodged the Sonic the idea and admits they think the "Sonic" contrail relates to the Raz Battle Pass skin and some sort of variation. This still doesn't explain why Sonic was used as a codename - suggesting we should look out for more clues on this one.</p>
<p>Either way, fans were over the moon about the suggestion Sonic would come to <em>Fortnite</em>. Spiralling into suggestions for a whole host of <em>Sonic</em>-inspired skins, someone wrote, "Shadow and sonic in Fortnite would be so badass, imagine a Doctor eggman skin". Well, keep hoping. If Sonic did arrive in <em>Fortnite</em>, it would definitely be a unique skin. Can anyone else imagine a giant version of the hero running alongside Peely? At least it can't be worse than that <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-skin-terrifying-fall-guys-players/" target="_blank" title="Sonic The Hedgehog Skin Is Terrifying Fall Guys Players">haunting Sonic skin in <em>Fall Guys</em></a>. </p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire that a Sonic skin is zooming around in the <em>Fortnite</em> code, it just so happens he celebrated his 30th anniversary on June 23. Then again, wouldn't it have made sense to have a tie-in skin on the actual date and not over a week later? As the days go on, the introduction of a Sonic the Hedgehog skin in <em>Fortnite</em> look less likely.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>That being said, remember that Epic has been busy hyping the imminent arrival of <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/fortnite-loki-skin/" target="_blank" title="Loki Is Officially Coming To Fortnite In July">Loki as part of the Fortnite Crew</a>. Introducing two pop culture giants so close to each other would be too jarring. We're not sure how Sonic would be added to the game, but he's likely to be a limited-time addition to the shop. Fortnite Crew is a monthly subscription, and with some sure to restart their membership, players might not have enough dollar to splash out on Loki and Sonic. </p>
<p>Having a gaming legend like Sonic the Hedgehog in <em>Fortnite </em>would be great, but at the time of writing, we just don't see it happening. In the past, we've seen icons like Master Chief, Kratos, and Aloy make their mark, but for the time being, we're going to park Sonic in the maybe pile with that <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/fortnite-samus-skin/" target="_blank" title="Next Big Fortnite Crossover Has 'Been Revealed' ">long-awaited Samus skin for <em>Fortnite</em></a>. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Maybe it is the <em>Minecraft</em>-esque animated colour palettes and characters that doesn't give <a rel="noopener" href="/fortnite/" target="_blank" title="Fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em> </a>the respect that many believe it deserves in the esports scene. Maybe it is the demographic that play the game, in comparison to old-school esports like <em><a href="/counter-strike/" title="CS:GO">Counter-Strike</a></em> and <em><a rel="noopener" href="/league-of-legends/" target="_blank" title="LOL">League of Legends</a></em>. Or maybe it's the complexity of the elite players that make it difficult to follow. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>However, there's no denying that Fortnite's esports scene is littered with "cracked" players pulling off insane plays in seemingly impossible scenarios.</p>
<p>Now, OpTic Chicago content creator and former <a href="/halo/" title="Halo"><em>Halo</em> </a>professional Nick "<strong>MaNiaC</strong>" Kershner has claimed that Fortnite has the highest skill cap in the entire of esports, alongside Starcraft.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>OpTic MaNiaC On Fortnite's Skill Cap </h2>
<p>After discussing the recent <a href="/articles/world-series-of-warzone-how-to-apply-prize-pool-format-and-more/" title="World Series Of Warzone Announced: How To Apply, Prize Pool, Format, And More">World Series of Warzone</a> event with OpTic's leading Assault Rifle main Matthew "<strong>FormaL</strong>" Piper, the podcast quickly turned towards the mould of battle royales, and how they can improve.</p>
<p>With FormaL, ManiaC, Dylan "<strong>Envoy</strong>" Hannon, and Hitch "<strong>Hitchariide</strong>" Davidson all complimenting the battle royale logistics that was implemented in the WSOW, the comparison was instantly drawn to Fortnite. As the <em>Warzone</em> event had an emphasis on kills rather than placement, on a multiplier scale rather than points allocation, the OpTic cast identified this as the main reason that it didn't follow a camp-like Fortnite style of play.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>However, the cast was full of praise for the elite Fortnite players, applauding their awareness and ability, with MaNiaC stating "I feel like that has to be the most 'cracked', highest-skilled game ever," which was agreed upon by the two<a href="/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty"><em> Call of Duty</em></a> pros in Envoy and FormaL.</p>
<p><em><strong>Topic Starts At 3:25</strong></em></p>

<h2>Call of Duty pros discuss Fortnite Skill Cap</h2>
<p>OpTic's power duo of Envoy and FormaL took to discussing <em>Fortnite's</em> esports scene, having taken a short break from the rigid <a href="/cdl/" title="CDL"><em>Call of Duty</em> League</a> schedule.</p>
<p>Envoy started by saying: "It's crazy how well they keep track of where they are in each other's builds. Like when they're building through each other's structures too, nuts."</p>
<p>FormaL also praised the building mechanics, implying that it's that element that sees Fortnite as such a high-skill game, taking away from the core gunplay. He said: "I know. When they're trying to pay attention to what their [opponents] are doing, like countering and s**t. It's like a whole different game. Everyone can shoot when they're a pro, but like they're not even shooting, they're building and editing."</p>
<p>The OpTic guys also claimed that <em>Starcraft's</em> micro-management is also one of the highest-skilled techniques to master in esports, before going on to answer questions from fans about how they operate in the CDL.</p>
