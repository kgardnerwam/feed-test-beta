<p>The video for <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-weeknd/"><strong>The Weeknd</strong></a>&#x2019;s 2016 hit featuring Daft Punk, &#x201C;I Feel It Coming,&#x201D; has now reached one billion views on YouTube.</p><p>The song, which appeared on The Weeknd&#x2019;s third studio album, <i>Starboy</i>, peaked at No.4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Since then, over 60,000,000 copies of the song were sold in the U.S. alone. The track was originally released on November 24, 2016, the day before the LP arrived. It&#x2019;s the second most streamed song off <i>Starboy</i> on Spotify, currently boasting over one billion streams (as of now, &#x201C;Starboy&#x201D; is top-streamed song from that album on the music streaming platform, with nearly two billion streams).</p>
		<p>The music video, directed by Warren Fu, was released on March 9, 2017. It features Koko Mizuhara as The Weeknd&#x2019;s Starboy persona&#x2019;s paramour, Stargirl. The pair unite on a deserted planet but are turned into stone statues after an eclipse. At the end of the video, Daft Punk appear in cloaks, finding a mysterious, glowing purple rock under the snowy ground.</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFLhGq0060w?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">&#xFEFF;</span></iframe></div><p>In the years since <i>Starboy</i>, The Weeknd has released two albums: <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/listen-the-weeknd-after-hours/"><strong><i>After Hours</i></strong></a> and <a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/weeknd-new-album-dawn-fm-out-now/"><strong><i>Dawn FM</i></strong></a>.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/monterey-jazz-festival-gregory-porter-joel-ross-brandee-younger/">Joel Ross</a></strong> has shared a music video for his standout jazz cut, &#x201C;Guilt,&#x201D; one of many stunning epics featured on his new album <em>The Parable of the Poet</em>.</p><p>The stirring, cinematic visual makes allusions to the Bible as a man scatters flower pedals across a woman&#x2019;s torso in a body of water. The experimental video also features choreographed dance moves captured in black and white.</p>
		<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe name="YouTube Embed" title="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P9_f3q4F-6Y?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div><p>Ross released his critically acclaimed new album,&#xA0;<strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/joel-ross-the-parable-of-the-poet/"><em>The Parable of the Poet</em></a></strong>, in April.&#xA0;The album embodies his collaborative spirit and finds him exploring new territory with his eight-piece Parables band featuring <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/immanuel-wilkins-7th-hand-album-out/">Immanuel Wilkins</a></strong> on alto saxophone, Maria Grand on tenor saxophone, Marquis Hill on trumpet, Kalia Vandever on trombone, Sean Mason on piano, Rick Rosato on bass, Craig Weinrib on drums, and special guest Gabrielle Garo on flute.</p><p><em>The Parable of the Poet</em> was initially released on exclusive D2C color vinyl, CD, and digital formats, with a black vinyl released on May 20.</p><p>Ross&#x2019; vision for the music is at once explicit and mysterious. Each title of the sven-movement suite references an emotional decision or experience for Ross, and he seeks to express themes present in parable tellings and retellings, while leaving each story&#x2019;s particulars open to interpretation. Ross rarely includes narrative explanations of anything he plays. He leaves his own motivations unvoiced, allowing both listeners and bandmates their unique, experiential readings of the music. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m just so interested in what the listener receives, what they take from it,&#x201D; he says, &#x201C;the same as you would from any parable.&#x201D;</p><p>Ross recently discussed <em>The Parable of the Poet</em> with Blue Note President Don Was on a recent episode of &#x201C;First Look.&#x201D; In support of the new album, Ross hit the road for a large run of shows, which will continue through the fall.</p><p><strong><a href="https://joelross.lnk.to/ParableOfThePoet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy or stream <em>The Parable of the Poet</em>.</a></strong></p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/bts-new-album/">BTS</a></strong> will celebrate their ninth anniversary and the release of their new anthology album <em>Proof</em> in style next week with a special live event.</p><p>The Korean record-breakers are set to hold a <em>Proof</em> live performance, which will be streamed via their official YouTube channel, Bangtan TV.</p>
		<p><em>Proof Live</em> will take place on Monday (June 13) at 9pm KST (8am ET). According to a poster shared on <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/bts_bighit/status/1533826043915735040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the group&#x2019;s Twitter page</a></strong>, a &#x201C;special guest&#x201D; will also join the seven-piece for the event. No further details about the event have been shared at present.</p><p>The online performance will follow the release of the <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/bts-reveal-tracklist-for-forthcoming-anthology/"><em>Proof</em> anthology album</a></strong> &#x2013; which spans three discs &#x2013; on Friday (10). The record will reflect on BTS&#x2019; journey so far, collating some of their biggest hits from the last nine years, as well as demo versions of familiar tracks, previously unreleased songs, and the brand new single &#x201C;Yet To Come.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;The BTS anthology album that embodies the history of BTS will be released as they begin a new chapter as an artist that has been active for nine years to look back on their endeavors,&#x201D; BTS&#x2019; label, Big Hit Music, said in a statement. &#x201C;The anthology album Proof consists of three CDs [and] includes many different tracks &#x2013; including three all-new tracks &#x2013; that reflect the thoughts and ideas of the members on the past, present, and future of BTS.</p><p>In the lead-up to the release of <em>Proof</em>, BTS has also embarked on their own Apple Music radio show, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/bts-apple-music-bts-radio-past-present/"><em>BTS Radio: Past &amp; Present</em></a></strong>. In the first episode, titled <em>Beginnings</em>, the group shared songs that charted &#x201C;the rise of BTS and songs that shaped their sound and style.&#x201D;</p><p>Rapper Suga chose &#xA0;&#x201C;Intro &#x2013; The Most Beautiful Moment In Life&#x201D; as one of his picks, explaining: &#x201C;I remember working on this song and exactly how much I struggled with it. Thinking about it brings tears to my eyes right now. [There are] just so many memories with this song.&#x201D;</p><p>Singer Jungkook, meanwhile, selected &#x201C;I Need U,&#x201D; saying that the 2015 track &#x201C;is special to us in many ways.&#x201D; &#x201C;The album&#xA0;<em>The Most Beautiful Moment In Life</em>&#xA0;I think is just a great album, and &#x201C;I Need U&#x201D; got us our very first No.1 win on a Korean music show,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;I think back then was when we first got the feeling that we were finally being noticed, finally about to make it.&#x201D;</p><p><strong><a href="https://udiscover.lnk.to/BTS" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Listen to the best of BTS.</a></strong></p>

<p>UMe has unveiled a brand new playlist in tribute to artists born during the Gemini season (about May 21 to June 21). The collection is also celebrating Black Music Month, which runs throughout June.</p><p>The playlist features artists from all eras like Sage the Gemini, The Game, Jadakiss, Juice WRLD, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/lenny-kravitz/">Lenny Kravitz</a></strong>, Faith Evans, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/licence-thrill-glorious-voice-gladys-knight/">Gladys Knight &amp; The Pips</a></strong>, and more.</p>
		<p>The playlist also features the classic <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/commodores/">Commodores hit &#x201C;Zoom,&#x201D;</a></strong> which was included on their 1977 self-titled album. The group, led by Lionel Richie, were already an established name when their 1977 record hit shelves.&#xA0;<em>Commodores</em>, produced as usual by the band with regular confidant James Anthony Carmichael, displayed just the same flexibility. Its signature hits alone showed off their ability to mix it up. Richie&#x2019;s killer ballad, R&amp;B No.1 and pop Top 5 hit &#x201C;Easy&#x201D; contrasted with the ultra-funky &#x201C;Brick House.&#x201D; That also made the Top 5 in both genres. While those two are rightfully celebrated, &#x201C;Zoom&#x201D; is also a fan favorite.</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FFok7oW2sI?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div><p>Also featured on the playlist is <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/uptown-records-reissues-jodeci-guy-heavy-d-christopher-williams/">Heavy D and The Boyz&#x2019;s</a></strong> 1994 hit, &#x201C;Got Me Waiting.&#x201D; The track is featured on their fifth and final studio album, <em>Nuttin&#x2019; But Love</em>. <em>Nuttin&#x2019; But Love</em> proved to be the group&#x2019;s most successful release, reaching No.11 on the Billboard 200, No.1 on Billboard&#x2019;s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart (for one week), and was certified 2&#xD7; Platinum.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/the-game/">The Game&#x2019;s</a></strong> 2005 smash &#x201C;Dreams&#x201D; from <em>The Documentary</em> has also made its way onto the playlist. The record was released by Aftermath Entertainment, G-Unit Records, and Interscope Records. The record served as The Game&#x2019;s major-label debut, preceded by his independently released debut <em>Untold Story</em> in 2004. The hit project includes production from high-profile producers such as Dr. Dre, Kanye West, Scott Storch, and Timbaland.</p><div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" name="YouTube Embed" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2K0q74jtV8s?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div><p>Also included on the playlist is <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/stories/rae-sremmurd-sremmlife-debut-album/">Rae Sremmurd&#x2019;s</a></strong> 2016 viral smash &#x201C;Black Beatles.&#x201D; Described as a &#x201C;hood N&#x2019;Sync&#x201D; by producer Michael &#x201C;Mike WILL Made-It&#x201D; Williams for their pop-friendly energy, the brothers behind Rae Sremmurd &#x2013; Aaquil &#x201C;Slim Jxmmi&#x201D; Brown and Khalif &#x201C;Swae Lee&#x201D; Brown &#x2013; carved out their own lane in hip-hop with their single, which felt like it was played <em>everywhere</em> upon its release.</p><p>Also featured in the mix is <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/dave-east-mary-j-blige-know-how-i-feel/">Dave East&#x2019;s</a></strong> 2020 hit &#x201C;Handsome&#x201D; from <em>Karma 3</em>.

<p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/demi-lovato/">Demi Lovato</a></strong> has announced their new album <em>Holy Fvck</em>. The follow-up to 2021&#x2019;s <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/demi-lovato-dancing-with-the-devil-deluxe-album/"><em>Dancing With the Devil&#x2026;The Art of Starting Over</em></a></strong> is out August 19 via Island Records.</p><p>The lead single from the new album is called &#x201C;Skin of My Teeth,&#x201D; which is out this Friday, June 10. To celebrate the news, Lovato has unveiled the <em>Holy Fvck</em> album trailer and cover.</p>
		<div class="uD-YT-container"><iframe name="YouTube Embed" title="YouTube Embed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYSh1aTDLt8?rel=0" class="uD-YT-video lazyload" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></div><p><em>Holy Fvck</em> will include 16 songs. In a statement, Lovato said: &#x201C;The process of making this album has been the most fulfilling yet, and I&#x2019;m grateful to my fans and collaborators for being on this journey with me. Never have I been more sure of myself and my music, and this record speaks that for itself. To my Lovatics who have been rocking out with me since the beginning and those who are just now coming along for the ride, thank you. This record is for you.&#x201D;</p><p>&#x201C;Skin of My Teeth&#x201D; was produced by Warren &#x201C;Oak&#x201D; Felder. Lovato wrote the single with Alex Niceforo, Keith Sorrells, Laura Veltz, and Aaron Puckett aka Lil Aaron. They&#x2019;ll perform the new song on the June 9 episode of <em>The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon</em>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/demi-lovato-skin-of-my-teeth-teaser/">Lovato first began teasing</a></strong> their pop punk return earlier this year in a post wearing all black, captioning the image: &#x201C;A funeral for my pop music.&#x201D; In the lead-up to &#x201C;Skin of my Teeth,&#x201D; they shared a teaser visual that finds a mysterious man holding up a camcorder to the lens as heavy guitars kick in. &#x201C;Demi leaves rehab again,&#x201D; Lovato sings. &#x201C;When is this s__t gonna end?&#x201D;</p><p>The same lyrical verbiage appears as a headline on the front page of the newsletter the singer shared with fans. Designed as a newspaper called The Daily Journal, the paper is marked June 10, 2022. An image of Lovato sits front and center next to columns of nondescript text with headlines reading &#x201C;Freak Demi Lovato Screams Eat Me To Paparazzi&#x201D; and &#x201C;Demi Lovato, 29, Seen With Mysterious Substance In The City of Angels.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="https://presave.umusic.com/dl-skinofmyteeth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Pre-order &#x201C;Skin of My Teeth.&#x201D;</strong></a></p>

<p>During <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/artist/lorde/">Lorde&#x2019;s</a></strong> third <em>Solar Power</em> show at London&#x2019;s Roundhouse on June 3, she spoke to the crowd about writing massive pop songs, and reflected on the nine-year anniversary of her breakthrough smash <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/lordes-royals-one-billion-streams/">&#x201C;Royals.&#x201D;</a></strong></p><p>&#x201C;Over the years, I&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to share in those moments with you because, in my opinion, a banger is not created until the audience participates,&#x201D; Lorde said. &#x201C;You can write a good pop song but you are the ones that turn it into that thing that we all know to be a banger.&#x201D;</p>
		<p>She added, &#x201C;We&#x2019;ve had a really difficult, painful, lonely few years and artists take that, and they process it and they make something that&#x2019;s maybe quieter, or more private. But the banger will always be on the horizon. I want to say thank you for being so welcoming and wonderful on this tour. I&#x2019;m getting nearer to that zone again, where all I&#x2019;m going to write is those sort of songs for us all to dance to, and to feel in our hearts. Thanks for changing my life.&#x201D;</p><p>Last month, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/lorde-curated-station-sonos-radio/">Lorde launched her own curated station</a></strong> on Sonos Radio, called SOLARSYSTYM. The station saw the singer looking back throughout her life and career, from her youth to now, charting the pivotal moments and artists that impacted her along the way. Artists featured included J Dilla, Cocteau Twins, Radiohead, and more.</p><p>&#x201C;SOLARSYSTYM is like stepping into my brain, giving listeners a front row seat to the songs that have meant a ton to me and my life,&#x201D; Lorde said in a statement announcing the station.</p><p>&#x201C;It is a collection of forms, gravitationally bound, a handful of planets, dozens, more dwarf planets, and countless little rocks. All reflecting light from a sun. These are the forms that have altered my course for better.</p><p>&#x201C;Everything from the tunes my parents pulled from their super sick CD tower to the songs I ripped off YouTube as a pimply teen to the records I include in full because they were that shapeshifting for me as a thinker and feeler.&#x201D;</p><p><a href="https://lorde.lnk.to/SPAlbum" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Buy or stream <em>Solar Power</em>.</strong></a></p>
