<![CDATA[ <div class="content ps-gallery"> <section class="row article-intro"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-3"> </article> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end"> <p><strong>With sales of e-bikes soaring, and previously inaccessible off-road spots now easier for casual riders to access, Jim Cherrington, Senior Lecturer of Sport Sociology at Sheffield Hallam University, dives into the pros and cons. </strong></p> <p>Sales of electric bikes have increased dramatically recently. In 2020, 4.6 million e-bikes were sold in the EU and UK, a <a href="https://cyclingindustry.news/european-cycling-market-now-worth-e18-3bn-localised-e-bike-production-hits-80/#:%7E:text=E%2DBike%20sales%20leapt%20to,that%20has%20been%20gathering%20pace.">52% rise</a> year on year. In the UK, nearly one in three adult bikes sold are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/08/electric-bike-and-scooter-sales-boom-pushes-halford-back-to-growth-covid-19">now electric</a>.</p> <p>But they are also the subject of much controversy, as e-bikes allow riders to go much further and faster in the countryside. This has led to an intense debate between cyclists, horse riders and walkers about what constitutes acceptable levels of <a href="https://www.imba.com/press-release/early-data-released-impacts-emtb-use-trails">speed, noise and erosion</a> from this new technology.</p> <p>Indeed, on social networking sites and various internet forums, there is also a widespread perception that e-mountain bike riders are <a href="https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-columns/over-a-beer-why-ebikes-are-the-spawn-of-satan-mostly/">selfish, lazy and anti-social</a>. These riders are also accused of being overly reliant on the motor and of travelling at speeds that are unsafe for other users of the countryside &#x2013; which is said to result in damage to biking trails and the wider environment.</p> <h2>Environmental implications</h2> <p>The introduction of a motor and a battery to an all-terrain bicycle may create the potential for many more cyclists to access the great outdoors. But the heavier components, wider tyres and added torque raise <a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/outdoors/a470260/are-electric-mountain-bikes-legal/">concern among</a> many riders about the potential environmental impact.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02604027.2019.1698234">Our research</a> shows that traditional mountain-biking involves a <a href="https://theconversation.com/mountain-bikers-can-strengthen-the-connection-between-humans-nature-and-recreational-space-137206">complex relationship</a> between riders, bikes and terrain. Through careful experimentation and progression, riders learn to be attentive to the limits and abilities of their body and their bike. And in doing so, they gain a deep appreciation for both the feel of the trail and the topography of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213078016300391">the landscape</a>.</p> <p>This has been shown to influence their encounters with other user groups, as mountain bikers make concessions for walkers and horse riders based on a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718514000955">mutual understanding</a> of the terrain. Riders will often give way to walkers travelling uphill and may choose to wait before passing horses on rugged trails to avoid dislodging objects that may strike or startle the animal.</p> <p>The fear with e-bikes is that the addition of a motor makes users complacent about the demands of the terrain, and the needs of other people &#x2013; with riders prioritising getting uphill as quickly as possible, or going as far as they can on a single battery.</p> <p>But while a lot of these fears and complaints may well be valid, most are based on anecdotal evidence rather than any actual research. So as part of our <a href="https://www.ridesheffield.org.uk/sheffield-hallam-university-e-bike-study-volunteers-wanted/">latest project</a>, that hasn&#x2019;t yet been published, we&#x2019;ve spoken with 30 e-bike riders in England to find out more about why people choose e-bikes and how they actually ride them. What our findings indicate so far is that electric mountain bike users are often more responsible than perceptions might suggest.</p> <h2>The benefits</h2> <p>Participants we have spoken to so far have told us how they constantly ask other (non-e-bike) riders how tired they are or how difficult the terrain is to ride, to accommodate the pace and energy levels of the group.</p> <p>When cycling with non-e-bikers, participants also told us that they position themselves at the back to avoid &#x201C;rubbing other people&#x2019;s noses in it&#x201D;, while some have said that they have swapped bikes with others when they are too tired to go on.</p> <p>E-bikes also seem to have a wider social role in relation to crime, ill-health and social exclusion. One participant &#x2013; a disabled former soldier &#x2013; said his e-bike has been the springboard for a new social enterprise that tackles youth offending through cycling. We&#x2019;ve also heard from several older participants who said purchasing an e-bike has led to vast improvements in their physical and mental well-being.</p> <h2>Risks and gains</h2> <p>On the other hand, we&#x2019;ve also had reports of riders barging through groups of walkers. And one of our participants, who works in the bike industry, was aware of two instances where e-mountain bike riders had gone too far into the wilderness, run out of battery, and needed to call the air ambulance.</p> <p>This concern is further illustrated by some of the riders&#x2019; relationships with the battery and on-board computer. Even though our research is still ongoing, numerous participants have described how the Bluetooth link between their bikes and GPS tracking apps such as Strava allowed them to &#x201C;compete&#x201D; more effectively against their friends.</p> <p>These are isolated incidents, but they reinforce <a href="https://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/210443/?isxn=9781522543480">existing studies</a> that illustrate how tracking devices can be enrolled with other forms of technology in sport and physical activity to enable immoral, disrespectful and irresponsible forms of behaviour. The use of Strava to encourage fast and competitive riding has <a href="https://enduro-mtb.com/en/strava-opinion/">also been linked</a> with increased trail damage and surface erosion.</p> <p>To quote the popular mountain bike commentator Rob Warner, &#x201C;electric mountain bikes represent the most significant thing to happen to mountain biking since mountain biking&#x201D;. They allow people to overcome a range of social and physical barriers and engage in more outdoor exercise.</p> <p>But questions remain as to whether the risk to the environment outweighs the potential gains for culture, health and society. <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/mtbleadership/article/20210429-mtb-leadership-news-Major-new-research-project-launched--into-E-mountain-bike-use-in-Britain-0">More research</a> is needed to ensure that future conversations are informed by evidence, rather than anecdotes.</p> <p><strong>This article is republished from <a href="https://theconversation.com">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

<![CDATA[ <div class="content ps-gallery"> <section class="row article-intro"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-3"> </article> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end"> <p><strong>For Milanese chef Cesare Battisti, protecting the tradition and legacy of the region&#x2019;s risotto is something he takes very, very seriously. Rome-based reporter Silvia Marchetti investigates. </strong></p> <p>How many times have you had risotto? Chances are, it was a counterfeit. Because the one and only <em>real</em> risotto is made in Milan and the Milanese affectionately call it r<em>isotto alla milanese&#xA0;(</em>cooked the Milanese-way<em>)</em> or&#xA0;<em>risotto allo zafferano</em> (cooked with saffron). In local dialect, it&#x2019;s simply <em>risott giad</em> (aka &#x2018;yellow rice&#x2019;).</p> <p>They&#x2019;re all the same thing. Essentially, a plateful of locally grown rice cooked with a few key ingredients including saffron (the spice that gives it its distinctive yellow color) and veal or vegetable broth to help the flavors amalgamate and create a creamy, gold-colored risotto with a soft texture.</p> <p>But watch out. Milan&#x2019;s dining scene is facing a metamorphosis with thousands of fancy concoctions and twists. In order to taste the original recipe in all its glory, there&#x2019;s only one place you should head to: Ratan&#xE0;, the restaurant of chef Cesare Battisti. A chic 1800s Liberty-style villa overlooking a park, it used to be the lair of a shaman priest (who used the building to run a small tavern) back in the 1930s.</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse medium-uncollapse"><div class="columns medium-6 medium-offset-3 end featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg 1048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-334x500.jpg 334w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-scaled.jpg 1708w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> Milanese chef Cesare Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine. <span class="photographer override">Photo courtesy of Ratan&#xE0;</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Ratan&#xE0; is cozy and chic, and a place in which the old very much meets the new. The restaurant, which enjoyed another former life as railway storage facility, reflects what Battisti calls &#x201C;industrial archaeology&#x201D;. The tables are made with old melted steel from railway tracks, while the view from the restaurant takes in Milan&#x2019;s futuristic modern skyscrapers.</p> <p>Ratan&#xE0; is the temple of <em>risotto alla milanese</em>, and locals who are crazy for this iconic dish flock here. Battisti serves it old-style: With bone marrow, <em>gremolata</em> (a lemon zest, parsley and garlic sauce) and roasted meat sauce. He also makes risotto with <em>ossobuco</em>; that&#x2019;s risotto served with a succulent braised veal shank placed on top that enhances the flavor and melts in the mouth.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/tijuana-food-drink-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How did Tijuana become Mexico&#x2019;s go-to foodie city?&#xA0;</a></strong></p> <p><em>Ossobuco</em> is a delicious, ancient ingredient that was ditched in the early 1900s as it was considered too greasy and subsequently substituted with &#x2018;lighter&#x2019; ones such as extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese.</p> <p>&#x201C;At the beginning, risotto was made with a simple broth. Bone marrow was added at a later stage when families could afford a more nutritive, expensive meal,&#x201D; says Battisti. &#x201C;Then healthy habits kicked in, vegetable broth and so on, but I still like to add <em>ossobuco</em>. It&#x2019;s my signature.&#x201D;</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-500x375.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-768x575.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1536x1150.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Milan&apos;s Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Milan&#x2019;s Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Ouael Ben Salah</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Milan born-and-bred, Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine.

Michelin-starred experiments are mere culinary pornography. Those chefs see their own ego reflected in their dishes. Their cooking is a narcissistic, snob act meant to confuse and intimidate eaters.&#x201D;</p> <p>Considered an authority when it comes to risotto, Battisti is down-to-earth but can be provocative.

Because the Declaration commits signatories to measuring their emissions and reporting on their efforts to reduce them, it will make it much easier to see who is truly walking the talk.</p> <p>In the long term, over the course of this decade, it will also make it easier to find the most sustainable providers because signatories commit to collaborating with each other and supporting the SMEs and smaller destinations that make up the majority of tourism, which will accelerate their response to the climate emergency.</p> <p>I think it will also improve the quality of people&#x2019;s experiences. The Declaration is not only focused on direct decarbonization, but also on the role tourism can play in regeneration of ecosystems and communities, which means cleaner water, more flourishing wildlife, and societies with a better quality of life. And that makes for better holidays.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any concerns about the timing of the Glasgow Declaration post-pandemic?&#xA0;A lot of travel businesses will be doing it tough for a while to come, and&#xA0;climate action might not be a priority for them right now.</strong><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p> <p>The longer we leave climate action, the harder it will be. It&#x2019;s better we work to embed climate action into the recovery, than to &#x2019;recover&#x2019; unsustainably then have a bigger hill to climb even more quickly and after more harm is caused in the next few years. The purpose of the Glasgow Declaration is to support our industry, bring them together to collaborate, and share resources, so it&#x2019;s important that this is done together, equitably, now.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row expanded collapse small-up-1 medium-up-2 img-block-col-2 "><div class="column"><img class="gallery " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacek-dylag-SPpsFbCaN2A-unsplash-3-1920x1080.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacek-dylag-SPpsFbCaN2A-unsplash-3-1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacek-dylag-SPpsFbCaN2A-unsplash-3-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/jacek-dylag-SPpsFbCaN2A-unsplash-3-1180x664.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 3840) 100vw, 3840" alt></div><div class="column"><img class="gallery " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shlomo-shalev-GoPYSBvZ-QQ-unsplash-5-1920x1080.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shlomo-shalev-GoPYSBvZ-QQ-unsplash-5-1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shlomo-shalev-GoPYSBvZ-QQ-unsplash-5-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/shlomo-shalev-GoPYSBvZ-QQ-unsplash-5-1180x664.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 3840) 100vw, 3840" alt></div></div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">&#x201C;One of the reasons we created Tourism Declares was a frustration&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a mild word, but let&#x2019;s use it for now&#x2014;that the majority of tourism&#x2019;s response to the climate emergency was based on saying things like, &#x2018;For every return flight you book with us to Australia, we&#x2019;ll plant a tree&#x2019;,&#x201D; says Jeremy Smith. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s marketing and it&#x2019;s feeble.&#x201D; <span class="photographer override">Top: Jacek Dylag; Bottom: Shlomo Shalev</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><strong>When COVID-19 was declared a health emergency, the world responded immediately.

Cutting emissions in half by 2030 is too slow. We should be cutting emissions in half by <em>tomorrow</em>, but that&#x2019;s not going to happen without a huge number of other consequences. But what&#x2019;s happened this week in Glasgow is enormous&#x2014;a never-before-seen coming together of our industry and destinations and communities to commit to climate action and with a capacity to make it possible.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row expanded collapse small-up-1 medium-up-2 img-block-col-2 "><div class="column"><img class="gallery " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mika-baumeister-jXPQY1em3Ew-unsplash-4-1920x1080.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mika-baumeister-jXPQY1em3Ew-unsplash-4-1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mika-baumeister-jXPQY1em3Ew-unsplash-4-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/mika-baumeister-jXPQY1em3Ew-unsplash-4-1180x664.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 3840) 100vw, 3840" alt></div><div class="column"><img class="gallery " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/markus-spiske-z56L143KBvE-unsplash-4-1920x1080.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/markus-spiske-z56L143KBvE-unsplash-4-1920x1080.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/markus-spiske-z56L143KBvE-unsplash-4-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/markus-spiske-z56L143KBvE-unsplash-4-1180x664.jpg 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 3840) 100vw, 3840" alt></div></div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">For the global travel and tourism industry, the Glasgow Declaration is a line in the sand; a commitment to overhauling business to benefit of people and planet, and with decarbonization front and center. <span class="photographer override">Top: Mika Baumeister; Bottom: Markus Spiske</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><strong>Have any airlines declared a climate emergency yet?</strong></p> <p>One airline has bravely declared it; a Tanzanian airline called Regional Air. There&#x2019;s no getting around the fact that the easiest way to reduce emissions related to tourism is to reduce aviation, because that&#x2019;s where such a significant part of tourism&#x2019;s emissions come from.</p> <p>And I do think that where it is replaceable, we should totally be looking to replace it. But I&#x2019;ve spoken with airline groups and they find the framework extremely challenging&#x2014;and we can&#x2019;t change the science to fit them in.</p> <p><strong>Where do you see the balance between individual and industry responsibility for tourism&#x2019;s carbon emissions: Who should do more?&#xA0;</strong></p> <p>Obviously everyone has to play their part, but the onus for change should weigh most heavily on those organizations that profit from the situation we&#x2019;ve found ourselves in, that design the marketing to encourage us to take the flights, to do the holidays, that made us all believe that &#x2018;relaxation&#x2019; and &#x2018;status&#x2019; means &#x2019;one week on the other side of the world.&#x2019;.</p> <p>As an industry, we&#x2019;re very fond of saying we&#x2019;re responsible for one in 10 jobs and 10 per cent of global GDP. Well, surely that puts us in a position of responsibility to be a leader, if we&#x2019;re responsible for a tenth of everything? It&#x2019;s time to stand up and make some changes.</p> <p>Also, we are a unique industry because we can take people to places to experience what a better world could be like. I&#x2019;ve always felt that tourism has this ability to show people a vision of the future, to say, &#x201C;This is what it&#x2019;s like to stay in a building that&#x2019;s entirely sustainably built and run, to eat totally organic food, etc.&#x201D;</p> <p>Then people go home and think, &#x201C;That was amazing!&#x201D; and start making changes in their lives. That puts the travel industry in the most enormous position of opportunity and, I think, responsibility.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fear-of-flying-Plane-in-Molde-Norway-Photo-credit-Unsplash-dong-zhang-374830-1180x782.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fear-of-flying-Plane-in-Molde-Norway-Photo-credit-Unsplash-dong-zhang-374830-1180x782.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fear-of-flying-Plane-in-Molde-Norway-Photo-credit-Unsplash-dong-zhang-374830-1180x782.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fear-of-flying-Plane-in-Molde-Norway-Photo-credit-Unsplash-dong-zhang-374830-500x331.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fear-of-flying-Plane-in-Molde-Norway-Photo-credit-Unsplash-dong-zhang-374830-768x509.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Fear-of-flying-Plane-in-Molde-Norway-Photo-credit-Unsplash-dong-zhang-374830.jpg 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Fear of flying: A plane flying over Molde, Norway."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">A small plane soars above Molde, Norway. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Fancy Crave</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><strong>How concerned are you about the impact of &#x2019;revenge travel&#x2019;, the anticipated post-pandemic travel boom sparked by people wanting to &#x2018;get back&#x2019; at COVID-19?</strong></p> <p>It&#x2019;s a horrible phrase and in the context of the post-overtourism return, it is hugely concerning. Throughout COVID-19, I&#x2019;ve often been asked, &#x201C;Do you think we&#x2019;re going to change massively and everything in tourism is going to become sustainable?&#x201D; and I massively hope so. Do I think &#x2019;revenge travel&#x2019; is going to be a thing? I hope not.</p> <p><strong>What&#x2019;s one thing you&#x2019;d like all travelers to understand to help them travel more sustainably?&#xA0;</strong></p> <p>Beauty is nearby. We&#x2019;ve built this whole &#x2018;bucket list&#x2019; mentality of &#x2018;ticking things off&#x2019; and once you&#x2019;ve seen it, you move onto the next thing.</p> <p>But that&#x2019;s such a shallow way to see things. When one discovers incredible things relatively nearby, there&#x2019;s an enormous benefit obviously in not flying to the other side of the world, but the other benefit is you get to go back.</p> <p>And going back is what makes things better. I like to think one of the positives of COVID-19, &#xA0;is that we&#x2019;ve started realizing that the world we live in for work and school and whatever else is also a magical world we can visit for long weekends and return to again and again, and that changes our relationship with the world. That&#x2019;s what &#x201C;sustainable tourism&#x201D; means to me.</p> <p><strong>Now that the Glasgow Declaration is up and running, will Tourism Declares slowly fade into the sunset?</strong></p> <p>Not at all. This is the end of the first chapter in our story. Tourism Declares will now be the flagship climate action program of the Travel Foundation, which ensures we have the governance, the funding, the structure and the support network to do much more than we could as a group of committed volunteers.</p> <p>We&#x2019;re still going to be very much a part of it all, doing all we can to make sure the necessary changes happen. Because it&#x2019;s one thing to say we&#x2019;ve got to cut emissions in half by 2030, it&#x2019;s a whole other thing to arrive at 2030 and say, &#x201C;We did it.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x2014;</p> <p><strong>Read more&#xA0;</strong></p> <p>See the <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/programmes/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration/signatories">full list of Glasgow Declaration signatories</a> and find out more on the <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/programmes/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration">One Planet Network.</a></p> </article></section> <section class="row article-base"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> </article> </section> <section class="row"> <article class="columns small-12"> </article> </section> </div> ]]>

<![CDATA[ Action in Tourism at COP26, Intrepid Travel co-founder Darrell Wade explains why this moment matters.&#xA0;</strong></p> <p>Greta is right: the time for &#x201C;blah blah blah&#x201D; is over. The climate crisis is without doubt the issue of our times, and the travel industry, which is responsible for an estimated 8 per cent of global emissions, should be taking its contribution to this crisis very seriously.</p> <p>For long too long there has been too much talk and too much rhetoric when it comes to climate action&#x2014;whether that&#x2019;s in the travel industry or beyond. There has been action on a variety of fronts, sure. But while offsetting, tree planting, carbon credits and other such solutions have their place, they&#x2019;re ultimately not going to cut it. What the world needs is <em>actual</em> carbon reduction. Fast. And at scale.</p> <p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/glasgow-declaraton-tourism-explainer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glasgow Declaration explained: Climate action for tourism finally takes the spotlight</a></strong></p> <p>As an industry we need more measurable action, and we need to be able to hold organizations who claim to be taking climate action to account. We need decarbonization on a massive scale: less greenwashing, more green-doing.</p> <p>Sustainable travel advocates and industry insiders Jeremy Smith and Alex Narracott had the right idea when they founded <a href="https://www.tourismdeclares.com/">Tourism Declares a Climate Emergency</a> back in 2019. That incredible movement, which was run by volunteers, resulted in close to 400 travel organizations signing up to commit to climate action. It was clear that there was real appetite for change from small to medium sized companies all around the world. </p> <blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Travel companies have to take action. And show us you mean it: sign this Declaration, and prove you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.</p></blockquote> <p>But if we&#x2019;re looking to decarbonize as an industry, we need to get the big carbon emitters (think airlines, hotel chains, cruise lines) on board. And we need them to remain on board for the long haul.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s why the announcement of the Glasgow Declaration: A Commitment to a Decade of Tourism Climate Action at COP26 this week is so important. This industry-changing Declaration is an evolution of Jeremy and Alex&#x2019;s Tourism Declares work (and the work of many other brilliant and committed individuals), except now it has the backing of the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), among others.</p> <p>The Declaration&#x2019;s goals are clearly defined, and we will be able to measure and track signatories&#x2019; progress against their pledges. That framework and accountability is important: this is about action, not talk.</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021-1180x788.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021-1180x788.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021-1180x788.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021-500x334.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021-768x513.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Darrell-Wade-2021.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Photo courtesy of Intrepid Travel"></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Darrell Wade says the time for the tourism industry to take decarbonization seriously is now. <span class="photographer override">Photos courtesy of Intrepid Travel</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>I have this week signed the Glasgow Declaration as Vice Chair of World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC)&#x2014;a role I have held for the past year. Intrepid Travel, the company I co-founded 30 years ago, is also a signatory. The Declaration has two primary goals: the first is to commit signatories to reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, and the second is to commit them to becoming net zero by 2050. And beneath that, there are a number of other clear commitments, like releasing a climate plan within the first 12 months of signing as a way to validate your method towards decarbonization.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/jeremy-smith-glasgow-declaration-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&#x201C;A landmark moment&#x201D;: Jeremy Smith, co-founder of Tourism Declares, on the significance of the Glasgow Declaration</a></strong></p> <p>The second initiative to be unveiled at COP26 is the &#x2018;Roadmap to 2050&#x2019;, which has been prepared in conjunction with WTTC members and Accenture. The roadmap is an initiative by the WTTC, and it takes a sector-specific approach to reaching net zero for 2050. There are separate work streams for aviation, hotels, cruise, tour operators and destinations. This work is important, because when an organization comes to us and says: &#x201C;Sorry, that can&#x2019;t be done&#x201D;, we can show them the roadmap and say: &#x201C;Yes it can, and here&#x2019;s how.&#x201D;</p> <p>On top of that, Intrepid&#x2019;s very own Environmental Impact Specialist, Susanne Etti, in partnership with Tourism Declares, has authored an open-source <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/au/download-our-carbon-measurement-blueprint-for-tour-operators">Carbon Measurement Blueprint for Tour Operators</a>. It&#x2019;s designed to help other tour operators begin to measure their carbon emissions because if they can measure, they can begin to reduce.</p> <blockquote> <p>It&#x2019;s on us&#x2014;travelers and travel organizations alike&#x2014;to turn this climate moment into a climate movement. The decisions we make matter.</p> </blockquote> <p>The inconvenient truth, though, is that the travel industry is <em>way</em> behind where it needs to be, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to get our house in order and aligned with Paris obligations and a 1.5 degree world. It&#x2019;s true that some industries&#x2014;like aviation and shipping&#x2014;are harder to decarbonize than others, but one way or another the world will and must decarbonize, or we have no future at all.</p> <p>I can&#x2019;t say this plainly enough, but when it comes to the climate&#x2014;whether the travel industry or any other industry&#x2014;the time for talking is over. We must act now, we must act together, and we must <em>work</em> together if we&#x2019;re going to have a hope in hell of pulling this off. Travel companies have to take action. And show us you mean it: sign this Declaration, and prove you&#x2019;re willing to put in the work.</p> <p>Now this is all obviously very heavy and very serious stuff. But for me, and I think for all of us at Intrepid Travel, and certainly for my co-founder Geoff, this duty of care we feel towards this magnificent planet and all of the creatures on it is a direct result of the many experiences we&#x2019;ve been lucky enough to have all over it. We owe it to one another, and to future generations, to secure a truly sustainable future. And for individual travelers who care about this issue&#x2014;I know there are a lot of you&#x2014;you can now choose to use the services of more than 300 companies that have signed the Glasgow Declaration.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m moving into the final days of COP26 and beyond with a sense of cautious optimism. I think humans are capable of pretty incredible things when backed into a corner (even if it&#x2019;s a corner of their own making), but it&#x2019;s going to take all of us to get this right. It&#x2019;s on us&#x2014;travelers and travel organizations alike&#x2014;to turn this climate moment into a climate movement. The decisions we make matter. And what we do next is going to matter for a very long time to come.</p> <p><strong>Read more</strong></p> <p>You can view all of the Glasgow Declaration signatories and <a href="https://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/programmes/sustainable-tourism/glasgow-declaration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find out more at One Planet Network</a>.</p> </article> <section class="row article-base"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> </article> </section> <section class="row"> <article class="columns small-12"> </article> </section> </div> ]]>

Too large for our bookshelves, it lay below, covered by the paraphernalia that got piled on top. It was an undertaking just to pull it out.

No rights of way feature on Scottish maps, as most land is publicly accessible, but as a result, fewer paths are distinctly marked. And those that are, particularly on a rain-damp map, bear strong resemblance to the symbols for power lines, which are less fun to walk along.</p> <p>The easy-to-follow country lanes of the east erupt, with little warning, into entire mapsheets of pathless mountainside where you must switch from complacently following signposts to furiously scrutinising mapscape contour lines and crag lines for that optimum through-route.</p> <p>And inevitably, as I found only upon reaching the first serious highlands, the valleyside paths that are the main means of crossing them run overwhelmingly north-south. Heading westward-bound, it was over the top then down then up again, like a brutal multi-day rollercoaster ride.</p> <p>There were certain tricks to the trade. Estate tracks were among the few that went against the grain and in the direction I needed&#x2014;a ruined croft could have just enough sheep-nibbled grass to provide respite from the midges lurking in the heather-cloaked moor that dominated the route.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-1180x885.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-1180x885.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-1180x885.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-500x375.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-768x576.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Scotland-Orienteering-Camping-on-top-of-Cairn-Gorm-Photo-credit-Luke-Waterson.jpg 2400w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="A green tent alone on a barren hill."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Camping on top of Cairn Gorm. &#x201C;Orienteering like this, there are no worries about whether you make so-and-so flight, get a table at so-and-so restaurant,&#x201D; writes Luke Waterson. &#x201C;Only two things stand in your way&#x2014;the land and your ability to cross it.&#x201D; <span class="photographer override">Photo: Luke Waterson</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Equally, 12 days and nights of choose-your-own-adventure hiking across rough country and making camp wherever tiredness overwhelms at day&#x2019;s end is hard, despite the intense beauty.</p> <p>The dirt never really washes off, swamp always soaks through, and the rucksack straps always cut through.

<![CDATA[ <div class="content ps-gallery"> <section class="row article-intro"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-3"> </article> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end"> <p><strong>For <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/emily-thomas-341632">Emily Thomas</a>, Associate Professor of Philosophy at <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/durham-university-867">Durham University</a></em> in the United Kingdom, travel and philosophy are forever intertwined. Here, she makes her case. </strong><br><br>In 2019, there were <a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152">1.4 billion international tourist arrivals</a> globally&#x2014;and, given that the planet only holds <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/">7.7 billion humans</a>, this figure alone suggests that a lot of us are travelling. The World Tourism Organization <a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284421152">reports</a> two major motivations for this&#x2014;&#x201C;travel to change&#x201D;: the quest for local experiences, authenticity, transformation and &#x201C;travel to show&#x201D;: the desire for Instagrammable moments and destinations.<br><br>I think both trends are fuelled by curiosity about the unknown, the unfamiliar. Humans have always looked for new experiences, ways to live, things to show to others. Travel magazines are strewn with articles about visiting &#x201C;<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/travel/2020/01/why-travel-2020-experience-overlooked-destinations-want-your-attention">overlooked</a>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19095928-3eaa-11ea-b84f-a62c46f39bc2">unknown</a>&#x201D; places&#x2014;and this curiosity has a long history.<br><br>Throughout his <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14363">Antarctic explorations</a>, Apsley Cherry-Garrard yearns for &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; places. Mary Kingsley describes the &#x201C;sheer good pleasure&#x201D; of canoeing down an &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5891">West African</a> river by moonlight, and delights in places &#x201C;not down&#x201D; on maps. A character in Joseph Conrad&#x2019;s Heart of Darkness describes how &#x201C;inviting&#x201D; the &#x201C;blank spaces on the earth&#x201D; seem and tells us about his hankering for &#x201C;the biggest, the most blank&#x201D;.<br><br>Philosophy can also be about exploring the unknown. In one of his <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SM2AzN_ZlmIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=berkeley+dialogues&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_lfXolJznAhXqVBUIHePyBcEQ6AEIPjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">groundbreaking books</a> on idealism, 18th-century Irish philosopher George Berkeley likened his investigations to a &#x201C;long Voyage&#x201D;, involving difficult travel across &#x201C;wild Mazes of Philosophy&#x201D;. Scottish Enlightenment philosopher David Hume offers similar reflections halfway through his most radical sceptical work <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-L4IAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hume+treatise+of+human+nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi9p-bWlJznAhWRYsAKHeFOCmoQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">A Treatise of Human Nature</a>.<br><br>He imagines himself as a sailor who has struck shallow water, narrowly escaping shipwreck. Safety tempts him to remain perched on the rocks, rather than venturing out onto &#x201C;that boundless ocean, which runs out into immensity&#x201D;. Yet Hume decides he will put out to sea again, in the same &#x201C;leaky weather-beaten vessel&#x201D;.</p> <h2>Wild mazes of thought</h2> <p>The &#x201C;philosophy of travel&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t a thing. It isn&#x2019;t the subject of lecture courses, or conferences&#x2014;there are no lists of great philosophical travellers. But, as I argue in my book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/019883540X?pf_rd_p=f20e70b1-67f9-48d1-8c78-ba616030b420&amp;pf_rd_r=TDTYNR8TNG2J459STQ13">The Meaning of Travel: Philosophers Abroad</a>, travel and philosophy have enjoyed a quiet love affair for centuries.</p> <p>Travellers and philosophers can both aim at pushing the limits of their knowledge&#x2014;at seeing how the world is. Adventurous travellers covet new places&#x2014;even Earth&#x2019;s unexplored oceans and planets around distant stars. Radical philosophers crafts new questions and shake old assumptions. What is time? Or matter? Or goodness?</p> <p>You might think wishing for the unknown is the only thing philosophy and travel have in common. Travel involves trains, passports, luggage. Philosophy involves books, ethics, bearded Greeks. But despite their differences, travel and philosophy are tangled together. Travel has affected philosophy, and philosophy has affected travel.</p> <p>Travel can help philosophers develop new questions. For example, 17th-century European travellers began bringing home, en masse, reports of foreign customs and beliefs. John Locke, the &#x201C;father of liberalism&#x201D;&#x2014;and a voracious reader of travel books&#x2014;discussed practices that Europeans found shocking. His <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pDNIAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=locke+essay+concerning+human+understanding&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRgc7ClZznAhXSgVwKHas_DmsQ6AEIMTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=locke%20essay%20concerning%20human%20understanding&amp;f=false">Essay Concerning Human Understanding</a> describes cannibalism among peoples in Georgia, the Caribbean and Peru; the immodest sex lives of Turkish saints; and atheism running rampant throughout China and Thailand.</p> <p>Some of these reports were erroneous: reports of cannibalism <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Everyone_Eats.html?id=3xWt_kWk6L8C">were exaggerated</a>, while&#x2014;even then&#x2014;China and Thailand had long religious traditions. But it was becoming clear that people across the planet disagree about ethics and religion. Locke used these disagreements to raise a philosophical question. Are there any innate ideas that all humans are born knowing? (For Locke, the answer was &#x201C;no&#x201D;.)</p> <h2>New questions</h2> <p>Travel is still prompting new questions today. What are the ethics of doom tourism, to places affected by climate change? Can we imagine what other, non-human minds are like? How might space travel affect us?</p> <p>Just as travel has moved philosophy forward, philosophy has sometimes pushed travel practices in new directions. Every so often, a new philosophical idea impels travel to particular places, or in particular ways. For example, American literary scholar Marjorie Hope Nicolson&#x2019;s <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Aw8j8JZhxpYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Marjorie+Hope+Nicolson%E2%80%99s+book+Mountain+Gloom,+Mountain+Glory&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjXx9_NlZznAhXhUBUIHe_RDUgQ6AEIKzAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Mountain Gloom, Mountain Glory</a> argues that, from the late 17th century, a new theory of space incited tourists to visit mountains. On this &#x201C;<a href="https://theconversation.com/what-is-space-the-300-year-old-philosophical-battle-that-is-still-raging-today-85628">Absolute</a>&#x201D; theory, space is God&#x2019;s immensity or infinite presence.</p> <p>Nicolson argues this led to people perceiving big, infinite landscapes such as mountains as divine. &#x201C;Great cathedrals of the earth&#x201D;&#x2014;as the Victorian thinker John Ruskin wrote of the Alps&#x2014;&#x201C;altars of snow&#x201D;. Once mountains had become cathedrals, everybody wanted to visit them.</p> <p>Similarly, the philosophy of wilderness set out in American philosopher Henry Thoreau&#x2019;s <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B_pKAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Henry+Thoreau+Walden&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjF4O7xlZznAhXJUBUIHSgxDRgQ6wEILDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">Walden</a> started a craze for solitary wilderness travel&#x2014;and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/what-it-means-that-urban-hipsters-like-staring-at-pictures-of-cabins/254495/">cabin porn</a>.</p> <p>What counts as unknown depends on your starting point. For British sailor James Cook, Alaska and Australia were &#x201C;new&#x201D; lands&#x2014;but their indigenous inhabitants knew them well. Roman Syria would have been unfamiliar to Chinese explorer Gan Ying, but not to the Syrians. Sometimes journeys explore places unknown to all human beings: the depths of <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/son-doong-cave-vietnam-expedition/index.html">Son Doong caves</a>, the under-snow <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/feb/24/antarctica-mountains">mountains of Antarctica</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/05/space-race-moon-mars-asteroids-commercial-launches">Moon and Mars</a>.</p> <p>Philosophers can also venture into areas of thought that are new to them but familiar to others. I would have this experience if I began researching medieval German philosophy, or contemporary Chinese philosophy. And philosophers can attempt to strike out into wholly new areas of thought. I think this is when philosophy and travel are at their most fascinating: when they look to the borders of what humans do not know.</p> <p><strong>This article is republished from <a href="https://theconversation.com">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

I&#x2019;ve been invited to stay with 37-year-old Italian-American Francesco Piattelli and his partner, Francesca Gambato to experience and document the harvest of their 4.5 hectares of olive trees in the heart of the Toscano IGP denomination. They&#x2019;ve spent the last two years nurturing these olives to produce their organic, sustainable olive oil, <a href="https://agricolamaraviglia.net/">Agricola Maraviglia</a>, and they lead harvesting retreats on the side. They grow and harvest their olives using traditional Tuscan techniques&#x2014;small batch, hands-on and organic. With over 85 per cent of production coming from their restoration of local family-owned groves, they&#x2019;re helping to regenerate the local environment and keep the Tuscan olive oil economy and legacy alive.</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-1180x787.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-1180x787.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-1180x787.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-500x333.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-768x512.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Olive-Oil-katie-mcknoulty-agricola-maraviglia-monte-san-savino-tuscany-9464-countryside-surrounding-olive-grove-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="The countryside surrounding the olive grove."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">This view has barely changed in generations.

But, asks Tracey Croke, when disaster or difficulty strikes, and we&#x2019;re at home, how can we use our resources to the best effect? </strong></p> <p>In her book Beyond Guilt Trips: Mindful Travels in an Unequal World, <a href="https://www.anutaranath.com/">Dr Anu Taranath</a> asks: &#x201C;We need not necessarily have to travel to think about equity and making a difference. But if we are given the privileges to experience other societies and meet new people, then what good is learning from our global travels if you&#x2019;re not going to put it to use when you get home?&#x201D;</p> <p>This question looped my brain as the events unfolded in <a href="https://adventure.com/tag/afghanistan/">Afghanistan</a> recently; a place close to my heart after trekking through the Pamir Mountains with the Wakhi and Kyrgyz people in 2013.</p> <p>Travelers now more than ever see themselves&#x2014;and their tourist dollars&#x2014;as a force for good. But when a humanitarian crisis strikes anywhere in the world, we feel distraught and completely helpless. What good can we do from afar for the places we visited and the people we met&#x2014;or are yet to visit and meet?</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Afghanistan-five-years-on-The-Wakhan-Photo-credit-Tracey-Croke-6-1180x787.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Afghanistan-five-years-on-The-Wakhan-Photo-credit-Tracey-Croke-6-1180x787.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Afghanistan-five-years-on-The-Wakhan-Photo-credit-Tracey-Croke-6-1180x787.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Afghanistan-five-years-on-The-Wakhan-Photo-credit-Tracey-Croke-6-500x333.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Afghanistan-five-years-on-The-Wakhan-Photo-credit-Tracey-Croke-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Afghanistan-five-years-on-The-Wakhan-Photo-credit-Tracey-Croke-6.jpg 2864w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Mountains rise up from the valley floor in the Wakhan, Afghanistan."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Mountains rise up from the valley floor in the Wakhan, Afghanistan, where writer Tracey Croke has visited. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Tracey Croke </span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>Helping in the short term</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>If you&#x2019;ve previously traveled to a country that&#x2019;s gone into crisis, it&#x2019;s likely you&#x2019;ll have contacts who can give you sound information about which organizations are still operating effectively and where aid is getting through.</p> <p>In Afghanistan, for example, the adventure community rallied to <a href="https://fundly.com/support-afghan-guides-and-fixers-1">Support Guides and Fixers</a> who worked with&#xA0;international tourists&#xA0;and small-scale media creators but were omitted from&#xA0;governments&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x2018;priority lists&#x2019; crucial for evacuation.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/afghanistan-taliban-perspective/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Now I&#x2019;ve left Afghanistan, will I ever have a home to return to?</a>&#xA0;</strong></p> <p>Among them,&#xA0;Afghanistan&#x2019;s first female professional tour guide, Fatima Haidari, who is a&#xA0;well-known outspoken activist for women&#x2019;s&#xA0;rights, has recently reached safety&#xA0;in Europe.&#xA0;They continue&#xA0;to assist and advise many others who&#x2019;ve been left without an income facing an&#xA0;uncertain future.</p> <p>Asking governments to increase resettlement visa quotas is an immediate need in any humanitarian crisis.

In the 19th century, the British Raj and Soviet Tsarist empires came face to face in Central Asia. Afghanistan was the tug-of-war country that separated the two imperial forces. In 1889, Lord Curzon, a British statesman said: &#x201C;Our relations with Afghanistan in the 40 years between 1838 and 1878 were successively those of blundering interference.&#x201D; You could copy and paste this quote to any country with an ongoing crisis.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s confronting to think that colonization is where modern-day travel sprouted from.</p> <p>We love to travel for all kinds of reasons; to relax, to have fun, to learn, to find ourselves, to have mind-blowing experiences, and&#x2014;my favorite&#x2014;to make those fuzzy-moment connections with people.</p> <p>Travel can do good, but let&#x2019;s be honest, it&#x2019;s still an extractive act. We may love travel, but how can travel truly love us back while the relationship is still so lopsided? And if pent-up &#x2018;<a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/revenge-travel-future_l_6052b724c5b638881d29a416">revenge travel&#x2019;</a> has its way, when we&#x2019;re back in full throttle, we&#x2019;ll be blundering across the world again like it&#x2019;s 1869.</p> <p>Another genius stroke of 19th-century &#x2018;civilizing&#x2019; (removing all rights, displacing and dispossessing) is how easy it&#x2019;s been throughout history to blame oppressed populations for the instability created. Demonization starts early in life with &#x2018;goodies and baddies&#x2019; and thrives well among today&#x2019;s politicians so they can put the fear of the &#x2018;other&#x2019; in us. Keeping us &#x2018;safe&#x2019; from the &#x2018;axis of evil&#x2019; was a sure-fire vote winner. We can analyse historical events until we glaze over, but the bottom line is always profit and power&#x2014;for one half.</p> <p>Longer term support for the people and places you care about means narrowing the wealth gap. And at 10 per cent of the world&#x2019;s GDP, travel has the clout to make a difference.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse medium-uncollapse"><div class="columns medium-6 medium-offset-3 end featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-1047x1570.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-1047x1570.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-1047x1570.jpg 1047w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-333x500.jpg 333w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sustainability-Photo-credit-ocg-saving-the-ocean-cyxRGU7keTw-unsplash-scaled.jpg 1707w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="People collect plastic waste from a beach"></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">A team from Indonesia&#x2019;s OCG Saving the Ocean collects plastic waste from a beach. <span class="photographer override">Photo: OCG Saving the Ocean</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>Well-researched choices can make a difference</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Tourism is a USD$9 trillion global industry, but many local businesses and communities never see a cent of it.

<title>Celebrating K’gari: Why the renaming of Fraser Island is about so much more than a name</title>

<![CDATA[ <div class="content ps-gallery"> <section class="row article-intro"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-3"> </article> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end"> <h5></h5> <p><strong>After a decades-long campaign by the Butchulla Traditional Owners of Australia&#x2019;s Fraser Island, the World Heritage-listed island has been formally returned to its original name, K&#x2019;gari. <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/rose-barrowcliffe-1155413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rose Barrowcliffe</a>, a Doctoral Candidate from the University of the Sunshine Coast, explains why that matters.</strong></p> <p>On the 19th of September, Butchulla dancers and community representatives came together at Kingfisher Bay Resort to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ButchullaAboriginalCorporation/posts/1201626620318442">celebrate the renaming of Fraser Island to the K&#x2019;gari (Fraser Island) World Heritage Area</a>.</p> <p>The renaming was the result of a decades-long campaign by Butchulla Elders and community members and was <a href="https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/93269">endorsed by the Queensland government and adopted by the World Heritage Committee</a>.</p> <p>This event is the latest in a growing number of Indigenous name repatriations across the nation. As a Butchulla person, and a researcher of the representation of Indigenous peoples in archives and historical narratives, I can appreciate the significance of something as seemingly small as a name change.</p> <h2>How common is it to revert to the Indigenous place name?</h2> <p>The reversion to the name K&#x2019;gari has happened in stages over a number of years. In 2011, the Bligh government added K&#x2019;gari as an alternative to the place name Fraser Island in the <a href="https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/qld/environment/land/place-names/search#/search=K&apos;gari&amp;types=0&amp;place=Fraser_Island__KGari_47533">Queensland Place Names Register</a>.</p> <p>The Fraser Island portion of the Great Sandy National Park was changed to <a href="https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/80891">K&#x2019;gari (Fraser Island) National Park in 2017</a>. This latest change is specifically in relation to the UNESCO World Heritage area.</p> <p>K&#x2019;gari is among a growing number of places around Australia that have returned to their Indigenous names. One of the most famous examples is Uluru.</p> <p>In Queensland, the National Parks First Nations Naming Project has been assisting in reverting national park names to Indigenous names where possible as a part of the government&#x2019;s commitment to the truth-telling process. North Stradbroke Island and Moreton Island National Parks have reverted to Minjerribah and Gheebulum Coonungai, respectively.</p> <p>According to then-minister for environment and the Great Barrier Reef, <a href="https://statements.qld.gov.au/statements/90294">Leanne Enoch</a>: &#x201C;This project is a positive step in our truth telling around First Nations Peoples&#x2019; significant and ancient connection to country.&#x201D;</p> <h2>Not renaming, reclaiming</h2> <p>Changing a place name will not fix racism in one fell swoop. No one is claiming it will. But name repatriation speaks to the importance of language in both culture and sovereignty.</p> <p>Indigenous place names link Traditional Country to the history, culture and people that have been a part of that land long before colonisation. Overwriting Indigenous names with colonist names is an attempt to deny this deep, pre-existing connection and the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples.</p> <p>The renaming of Butchulla Country was one of the first things Captain James Cook did as he first sailed the east coast of Australia.</p> <p>In 1770, as Cook&#x2019;s ship sailed close to Tacky Waroo, a large basalt headland on the east side of K&#x2019;gari, it was met by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=878H2fkw3L8">party of Butchulla warriors standing on the headland</a>. In the lexicon of the day, all dark-skinned people were called &#x201C;Indians&#x201D;, so Cook renamed Tacky Waroo &#x201C;Indian Head&#x201D;.</p> <p>In other cases, colonial place names were, and still are, blunt reminders of colonial violence. Places like Murdering Creek, Massacre Bay, Skull Creek and many more litter the Australian landscape and indicate <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/mar/17/so-many-australian-place-names-honour-murderous-white-men-and-their-violent-acts">violent acts that occurred in those places</a>.</p> <p>The name Fraser Island is named after a Scottish woman, Eliza Fraser, who was shipwrecked on the island in 1836. Fraser lied about being mistreated by Butchulla people after being shipwrecked. Even in those days, her account of her time on K&#x2019;gari was <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/kgari/">thrown into doubt</a>.</p> <p>Fraser was known to be a sensationalist who made her story more and more salacious as time went on, in efforts to garner more money from sympathetic supporters. Her accounts of her time on K&#x2019;gari were syndicated as far as the Americas, and reinforced the narrative that Indigenous peoples were &#x201C;savages&#x201D; and &#x201C;cannibals&#x201D;. These classifications led to <a href="https://www.uqp.com.au/books/finding-eliza-power-and-colonial-storytelling">Indigenous peoples being vilified around the globe</a>.</p> <h2>Colonial history is not Indigenous history</h2> <p>Language plays an important part in reinforcing the notion that history in Australia began with the arrival of Cook and his fleet.</p> <p>Colonial place names are another subtle yet persistent reinforcement of the notion that this land only has a place in history once it intersects with the narratives of colonists.</p> <p>K&#x2019;gari was the name chosen by the Butchulla because that is the sky spirit the island was created from. The name goes back to the very creation of the island, and yet the name that stuck was the name of a woman who spent not more than two months on the island.</p> <p>Re-adoption of Indigenous place names signifies the increased recognition of history and culture that predates colonisation. More importantly, these name repatriations recognise that history and culture continue today.</p> <p>The history of colonisation is not Indigenous history. Indigenous history and the history of this continent predates, pre-exists and will eventually override colonial history. Indigenous place names are evidence of that.</p> <h2>Bringing our past into a shared future</h2> <p>Repatriation of Indigenous place names is a part of the process of reintroducing Indigenous perspectives into the narratives of our modern society.</p> <p>Repatriation of Indigenous place names reaffirms that First Nations have always existed, and still exist in Australia today. Moreover, they are a source of distinction that sets Australia apart from the rest of the world for the one thing no other country in the world can come close to: being home to the oldest living cultures in the world. That should be a source of pride for all Australians.</p> <p>Always was, always will be K&#x2019;gari.</p> <p><strong>This article is republished from <a href="https://theconversation.com">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

It was an odyssey spanning six-days, 65 kilometers, one blister and several mid-trek epiphanies.&#xA0;</p> <p>When Hippocrates said &#x2018;walking is a man&#x2019;s best medicine&#x2019;, he was definitely onto something. After the year we&#x2019;ve had, getting out into Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park made me feel more alive, recharged and energized than sinking three espressos at my local Melbourne cafe ever could.&#xA0;</p> <p>I hadn&#x2019;t realized how much I&#x2019;d missed open spaces until I was bouncing across a boardwalk, button-grass as far as the eye could see.

I&#x2019;d overlooked what a day spent walking in nature can do to quiet a busy city brain.&#xA0;</p> <p>And while I&#x2019;m not the first writer to go on a really long walk and return with a few life lessons tucked into their hiking belt, I&#x2019;d be doing the track a disservice if I pretended that it&#x2019;s magnificent wilderness didn&#x2019;t inspire at least a little bit of introspection.&#xA0;</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1180x665.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1180x665.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1180x665.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-500x282.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-768x433.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-2048x1154.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Hikers on the Overland Track."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Six days of &#x201C;outdoorsy reflection&#x201D; helped travel writer Tayla Gentle process the last pandemic-ridden year. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Tayla Gentle </span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>A long walk is the best therapy session</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#x2019;m not saying you should break up with your therapist but I do believe there&#x2019;s something to be said for mulling things over on the trail.

Who wants to wait in a customs queue when you&#x2019;ve got heritage wilderness just over the Bass Strait?</span></p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-500x282.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-768x433.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2048x1154.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Be-prepared-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Hands hold a map of the Overland Track."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">For undertakings like the Overland Track, pre-trip preparation makes a big difference. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Tayla Gentle </span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>You can never be too prepared</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like, take your normal hiking packing prep and double it.

I didn&#x2019;t pack this many thermals when I hiked to Everest Base Camp, let alone on a Tasmanian jaunt in the middle of February. But when it proceeded to rain, non-stop, for the first 24 hours on the trail I was exceptionally grateful for that extra thermal. And that beanie, and the gloves. So invest in your gear, you&#x2019;ll be thanking me later. I certainly was thanking Stan. </span></p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1180x665.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1180x665.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1180x665.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-500x282.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-768x433.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-2048x1154.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Mulling-things-over-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Three travellers look out at the view on the Overland Track."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">As far as Tayla is concerned, &#x201C;group hiking is the rare social activity that manages to perfectly blend extroversion with introversion.&#x201D; <span class="photographer override">Photo: Tayla Gentle</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>Group hiking is the ultimate social experience</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#x2019;t agree? Hear me out. Group hiking is the rare social activity that manages to perfectly blend extroversion with introversion. It gives you the opportunity to make new friends but it also gives you an excuse to spend five hours a day walking in silence.&#xA0;</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the most part, the Overland Track is a single file march. You&#x2019;d be hard pressed to fit two trekkers abreast the boardwalk and the forested trails are narrow and thick with tree roots. So there&#x2019;s no pressure to make small talk when you&#x2019;re concentrating on scrambling a granite boulder or zig-zagging through a glacially-carved valley.&#xA0;</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when you make camp in the evening you can debrief with your trekking mates over hot chocolate and compare the day&#x2019;s blisters. Group hiking gives you a lot of &#x2018;me time&#x2019; and enough camp banter to make it a fulfilling social experience. It&#x2019;s the best of both worlds.&#xA0;</span></p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x885.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x885.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x885.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-500x375.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-768x576.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Adventure-is-right-here-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="The writer smiling to camera, backed by mountains."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Tayla poses for a photo along Tasmania&#x2019;s Overland Track. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Tayla Gentle</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>I realized that &#x2018;this too shall pass&#x2019;</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know it&#x2019;s a clich&#xE9;, but I&#x2019;ve never leaned into a clich&#xE9; more than I did this week.

Or when I could feel a blister brewing after a 10 kilometer downhill through eucalypt forest &#x2014;this too shall pass (so long as you deal with the hotspot as soon as you get to camp). Or when it was so windy atop Marion&#x2019;s Lookout that I thought it would slice right through my windbreaker&#x2014;this too shall pass.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this clich&#xE9; wasn&#x2019;t just reserved for the strenuous moments. It applied to the good stuff too. Like, when I was eating the best salad sanga of my life and looking out over vast Lake Windermere&#x2014;this too shall pass. Or when I was sitting underneath the biggest and brightest milky way I&#x2019;ve ever seen&#x2014; this too shall pass. The clich&#xE9; reminded me to stop and be grateful for those moments, because those, too, shall pass.&#xA0;</span></p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-500x282.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-768x433.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2048x1154.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-wildlife-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="A kangaroo among shrubs."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">A wallaby spotted while hiking Tasmania&#x2019;s Overland Track. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Tayla Gentle </span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <h2 class="none"><span>Never leave your snacks unattended</span></h2> </article> </section> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, did you know that possums don&#x2019;t like tea bags but they will happily spend two hours trying to open your backpack to get at your scroggin mix?

Besides &#x2018;people food&#x2019; not being good for animals, feeding them can make these wild animals lose their innate fear of humans and risk becoming both a nuisance and a safety issue. </span></p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1180x665.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-500x282.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-768x433.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1536x866.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-2048x1154.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-1920x1080.jpg 1920w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tassie-Overland-life-gratitude-and-snacks-Group-hiking-Photo-credit-Tayla-Gentle-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="A group of hikers walk in single file on the boardwalk."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">With much of the Overland Track spent walking single-file, there&#x2019;s plenty of time for reflection.
