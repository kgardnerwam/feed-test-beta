        <p>Fans have lined the streets of south London to pay tribute to The Wanted&apos;s Tom Parker, as his private funeral took place today (20 April).</p>

        <p>His wife, Kelsey, encouraged fans to come along for the procession, as they would be able to watch the service on screens outside.</p>
        <p>The singer passed away following his battle with a rare form of brain cancer on 30 March.<br></p>

          <p>A male podcaster is sparking debate after saying that women in relationships shouldn&apos;t have Instagram - or it counts as cheating.</p>
          <p>Myron Gaines from the
            <em>Fresh &amp; Fit</em>
            podcast is known for his divisive opinions, and also added that &quot;for women, attention is like sex for men.&quot;</p>
          <p>&#x201C;I think a woman having an Instagram is 100% cheating, especially if she has scantily clad photos of herself on the internet if she&apos;s not making money off it,&quot; he said, as he was greeted with shock from female guests.</p>

          <p>A deserted island house dubbed the &apos;world&apos;s loneliest home&apos; has gone up for sale for $339,000 (&#xA3;260k).</p>
          <p>Located on Duck Ledges Island in Maine, the tiny cottage is just 540 square-feet, and has just one bedroom and one bathroom - except the latter is located in an outhouse on the porch to maximise inside space.</p>
          <p>As it was only built in 2009, the decor is modern enough too.</p>
          <p>That being said, you&apos;re not going to be disturbed by neighbours, and it has some pretty incredible views of the ocean.</p>
