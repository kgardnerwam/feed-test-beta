There is no greater honour, none as a sports person than representing your country. The coverage is completely tinged with racism.&#x201D;</p><p>His comments came after a journalist was criticised for asking African Ajax striker Sebastien Haller if he was leaving the Dutch league to take part in the tournament.</p><p>Haller replied: &#x201C;This shows disrespect for Africa. Would this [question] ever have been asked to a European player towards a European Championship? </p><p>&#x201C;Of course, I will go to represent Ivory Coast. That is the highest honour.&#x201D;</p><p>In his broadcast, Wright praised Haller, saying: &#x201C;I have got to give a shout out to the players like Sebastien Haller who are taking a stand against the media backlash, plus Patrick Vieira for coming out and speaking about this. </p><p>&#x201C;This is why it is important to have a black manager who can let people understand where his roots are and how important this tournament is for African people.&#x201D;</p><h5>Speaking up against knife crime</h5><p>Wright used his platform to speak out against knife crime and said cuts to youth centres were linked to the many &#x201C;lives being wasted&#x201D; to knives.</p><p>He made the comments as his former club Arsenal launched an initiative alongside actor Idris Elba called &#x201C;No More Red&#x201D;.</p><div class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a5b339dff60343ef18e00cbdaa8456c3" id="54dfa"><div class="rm-embed-container rm-embed-twitter rm-loading"><span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-mobile" style="padding-bottom: 178%"></span><span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-desktop" style="padding-bottom: 135%"></span><div class="rm-embed-holder"><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-custom-tweet" data-partner="rebelmouse" data-twitter-tweet-id="1480218698136883211"><div style="margin:1em 0">\u201c&quot;30 kids died last year - one of those kids could be on that pitch&quot;\n\n\u26aa\u26aa\u26aa @Arsenal are wearing a special white kit this evening to shine a light on the epidemic of knife violence in London\n\n@idriselba explains all\n\n#NoMoreRed | @EmiratesFACup\u201d</div> &#x2014; ITV Football (@ITV Football) <a href="https://twitter.com/itvfootball/statuses/1480218698136883211">1641746613</a></blockquote></div></div></div><p>The initiative saw Arsenal wearing white shirts, instead of their usual red home kit, in a game to raise awareness of the issue and to call for &#x201C;no more bloodshed&#x201D;.</p><p>Speaking about the campaign, Wright said: &#x201C;Being a dad, granddad, great-granddad coming up to be honest, but the fact is I was fortunate when I was younger to have the spaces, have the youth workers.</p><p>&#x201C;When you look at the last 10 years, 750 youth centres closed down, 4,500 people out of work, youth workers, people you build relationships with, people that know you, and then when you look at the lives that are being wasted, this campaign is about inspiration and action.&#x201D;</p><p><strong><em>Have your say in our news democracy.

So we agree with his point.</p><p>But note his distancing language. <em>Inflation</em> is the &quot;enemy,&quot; not government decisions that have arguably led to it. Yes he wants to &quot;grip&quot; it now, but why has he let it get to this stage when he was chancellor for over two years?</p><p><strong>&quot;My experience means I&apos;m the best person to lead the economy into that future&quot; 2/10</strong></p><p>Your experience has shown you are a person who has already led our economy, and it isn&apos;t going gangbusters is it?</p><p><strong>&quot;This is not about what shoes I wear or what suit I&apos;m wearing this is about what I&apos;m going to do for the country&quot; 6/10</strong></p><p>Sunak was quizzed on his lavish lifestyle. He&apos;s a very wealthy man indeed and some people have suggested he is the wrong person to lead the country for that reason, claiming it means he will not be able to connect with ordinary working people.</p><p>Of course there is no such thing as an ordinary person and everyone lives in their own bubbles to some extent, influenced by their work, family, culture, geography - the list goes on.</p><p>So Sunak had a point and handled the awkward question with grace but there&apos;s a bit out of touch and then there&apos;s Rishi Sunak and if you need us to expand further, <a data-linked-post="2657706965" href="https://www.indy100.com/politics/rishi-sunak-out-of-touch">just look at all the times he really struggled to be a man of the people.</a></p><p><strong>&quot;We should move away from the very expansive ECHR definition&quot; 2/10</strong></p><p>Speaking about asylum, Sunak claimed the current system allows people with &quot;spurious&quot; reasons to come to the UK.</p><p>&quot;We must have control of our borders,&quot; he added and we aren&apos;t pleased about this policy at all.</p><p><strong>&quot;I&apos;m the most Northern chancellor this party&apos;s had for something like 70 odd years&quot; 1/10</strong></p><p>This is one of the most odd things we&apos;ve heard in 70 odd years, as Sunak defended his record in investing in the North of England.

We&apos;re not sure what the best plan of action is but at least she&apos;s principled.</p><p><strong>&quot;I was completely horrified&quot; 0/10</strong></p><p>In a very random segment of the interview, Truss was asked about her experiences watching <em>Love Island</em> and she revealed she wasn&apos;t a fan, only managing to get through 10 minutes of the show.</p><p>This might have been her most divisive statement yet, and given it is watched by so many people in the country, reveals her to be utterly out of touch!</p><p><strong>&quot;Not every country in the world has the same standards as the United Kingdom&quot; 2/10</strong></p><p>Questioned over whether Britain should boycott the World Cup, hosted by Qatar, over the country&apos;s human rights record, Truss disagreed and said we need to be &quot;practical and pragmatic&quot;. If we only did business with countries with the same standards as the UK, she said, we wouldn&apos;t be doing business with many.</p><p>Hmm.</p><p><strong>&quot;I was a teenage controversialist&quot; 3/10</strong></p><p>Truss was quizzed on her support for abolishing the monarchy when she was a member of the Liberal Democrats in her youth. She fobbed it off and blamed it on her youth but we&apos;d now say she&apos;s a middle-ages controversialist, but has just chosen new controversial policies to support.</p><p><strong>&quot;We&apos;ve still got a lot of economically inactive people who are not taking the opportunities of work&quot; 1/10</strong></p><p>What&apos;s that, you cry. Why it is the sound of victim-blaming rhetoric from the noughties about &quot;workshy benefits scroungers&quot;.</p><p>Ah, how nostalgic...</p><h3>Verdict</h3><p>While we didn&apos;t agree with the bulk of his policies, Sunak came across as competent and on top of the detail of his plans. He answered tough questions on his previous policies like furlough and Eat Out To Help Out well, and when he engaged with the audience he managed to connect to them, while just about avoiding looking like a smarmy Tony Blair tribute act.</p><p>Just about.</p><p>Meanwhile, Truss opted to strike populist chords at every turn, declaring that &quot;a woman is a woman&quot; apropos of nothing and reviving tired stereotypes about people who claim benefits.</p><p>It was like someone had got a ouija board and summoned Margaret Thatcher...</p><p>Nevertheless, she had some charm to her and managed to crack a few jokes.
