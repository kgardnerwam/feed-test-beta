rugby player is carrying a Christmas tree up the UK’s highest mountains to raise money for charity.</p><p>Ed Jackson was a keen outdoor enthusiast when he fractured multiple spinal vertebrae in 2017 as doctors warned him he may never walk again.</p><p>But the former rugby union star has defied the odds and, along with fellow climber Ross Stirling, is tackling the “12 Peaks Of Christmas” over six days, raising more than £12,000 so far for the Millimetres 2 Mountains Foundation and War Child’s Afghanistan emergency appeal.</p><p>The two started in Scotland on December 19 where they climbed to the summit of the UK’s tallest mountain, Ben Nevis.</p><p>They plan to conclude their challenge on the top of Snowdon on Christmas Eve.</p><p>The men are using a special rucksack from British outdoor brand Berghaus, modified by Sam Strong on the company’s product development team, to carry their tree up 11,490 metres of ascent in six days across Scotland, England and Wales.</p><p>The bespoke piece of kit allows Mr Jackson to climb despite his severe disabilities as he has tackled the country’s most challenging terrain, including the ascent of two 4,000 metre Alpine peaks in 48 hours.</p><p

39, will have climbed thousands of metres across the course of six days, from Skiddaw, Helvellyn, Scafell Pike and Great Gable in the Lake District to Yorkshire’s three peaks: Whernside, Ingleborough and Pen-y-Gent.</p><p>The 12 Peaks Of Christmas will conclude in Wales with Tryfan, Glyder Fawr and finally, Snowdon, the first major mountain Ed ascended after he was able to walk again.</p><p>The two are fundraising for the Millimetres 2 Mountains Foundation, founded by Mr Jackson to improve the lives of those facing mental health challenges following adversity in their lives through outdoor adventure.</p><p>The other 50% of money will be donated to War Child’s Afghanistan emergency appeal, to help more than 400,000 fleeing their homes in the wake of the country’s takeover by the Taliban.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Mr Jackson (left) and Mr Stirling have said they are

time for gratitude, cheer and hope, but for some it instead puts the spotlight on what was and could have been.</p><p>“Trauma, be it physical or psychological, can steal hope from anyone.</p><p>“Ross and I were well aware that carrying a tree while attempting the 12 Peaks Of Christmas is going be very hard work, but we’re determined to make it to the summit of Snowdon on Christmas Eve, which is where my post-accident journey in the outdoors really began!”</p><p>“As always, I’m hugely grateful to Berghaus for making some brilliant adaptations to kit that will help keep me moving in the mountains, and to everyone else who is supporting us,” he added.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add

teams.</p><p>He won the Four Nations title in 2006 with the England U18 team, before making his senior debut as a number 8 for Bath in 2007 and captaining the team at the Middlesex Stevens.</p><p>Mr

to air on Christmas Day</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/lost-morecambe-and-wise-episode-to-air-on-christmas-day</link><description><![CDATA[<p>A lost episode of Morecambe and Wise is set to air on Christmas Day after being discovered in an attic by Eric Morecambe’s son.</p><p>Dating from 1970, the 45-minute show was the comedy duo’s first for BBC One and dates from October that year after they moved from BBC Two.</p><p>Gary Morecambe discovered seven canisters in the attic of his mother’s house in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, while searching for old scripts last year.</p><p>His agent sent them off to be examined by experts who found they contained film.</p><p>One featuring part of a BBC sticker contained the lost episode, which was then colourised by the BBC.</p><p>The episode had originally been wiped from the BBC archive by the broadcaster so the tape could be reused for other programmes.</p><p>Gary Morecambe said the newly unearthed episode, which contains a sketch about a radio call-in challenge, represents “a golden era of television”.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Morecambe and Wise with the Prince of Wales (PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit...">PA Archive/PA Images - PA</small></p><p>He told BBC News he was “staggered” when he received a phone call confirming the episode had been found and was salvageable.</p><p>He added: “But I didn’t realise at that point how far the BBC would go to present it.</p><p>“That it would then get colourised, which is fantastic, so it’s been brought bang up to date.</p><p>“And also what’s really good is the quality of the show itself, you can see the embryonic Morecambe and Wise come through.”</p><p>He added: “It’s a bit like when they found something of Tony Hancock and Dad’s Army, these are important pieces from the golden era of television so to find something that was presumed wiped, and has been sitting in an attic for 50-odd years, that is very exciting and very important.”</p><p>Eric Morecambe, who died in 1984 aged 58, and Ernie Wise, who died in 1999 aged 73, are among the most popular and enduring comedy stars in British TV history.</p><p>The lost episode will air on BBC Two at 7.45pm on Christmas Day.</p><p>It will be preceded at 7pm by the pair’s 1971 Christmas show, featuring Andre Previn, Glenda Jackson and Dame Shirley Bassey.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 08:10:26

The treatment we received has meant that Emily is free from limits and the fear that the tiniest mistake could put her life at risk, and it has removed all the tension and worry that the simple act of eating loomed over us every day.</p><p>“It was particularly noticeable at special occasions like birthdays, Christmas and on holidays where there are often special foods like cakes, ice cream and treats that invariable had warnings, ‘may contain peanuts’ or menus not in English.</p><p>“Since the trial, Emily can go to parties and playdates with confidence, eat in restaurants without us having to call ahead to check the menu, and we’ve managed to have her first holiday abroad to New York and even taken part in feeding animals at zoo experiences – which is Emily’s passion.</p><p>“We could not be more grateful.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Emily and her family (NHS England)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>The Artemis study found that around six in 10 four to 17-year-olds who reacted to around 10g of peanut protein at the start of the trial were able to take a dose of 1,000mg of it by the end, which is well above the amount of accidental exposure.</p><p>Up to 600 children aged four to 17 are expected to be treated this year, with those in England to be the first treated in Europe, because of a deal struck by the NHS.

2022</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/snow-white-apples-and-bold-colours-forecast-to-brighten-up-gardens-in-2022</link><description><![CDATA[<p>“Snow White” apples, bold flower colours and planet-friendly gardening are among the trends expected for 2022, according to the Royal Horticultural Society.</p><p>The charity has drawn up its predictions for what will be popular next year based on gardener inquiries and views from experts.</p><p>Among the expected trends are a taste for more confident colours such as reds, oranges and purples, with plants such as crocosmia, salvia, canna and varieties of echinacea expected to prove popular.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Echinacea with strong colours could prove popular (Helen Yates/RHS/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>Houseplants will also become more colourful, with low-maintenance plants in brighter hues, such as the red succulent x Semponium “Sienna”, expected to overtake sales of green-leafed varieties.</p><p>The appetite for colour will even extend to fruit trees, the RHS forecasts, with red-fleshed “Snow White” apples, high in anthocyanins thought to be anti-inflammatory and anti-viral, becoming more common in gardens following the success of newly-introduced varieties “Tickled Pink” and “Surprise”.</p><p>Gardeners are also expected to try out growing more exotic fruits such as pomegranates, chokeberries and serviceberries.</p><p>After lockdown, a return to more office working means time in the garden has felt the squeeze – prompting a rise in labour-saving kit such as pre-planted baskets and troughs, self-watering pots and battery-powered pruners.</p><p>But for those with time to spare, learning a new skill is on the agenda, with many gardeners keen to lessen their impact on the environment, the RHS said.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Many gardeners are tipped to compost at home next year (Georgi Mabee/RHS/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>That could spur a resurgence in home composting techniques, and even a focus on scything which is easier than a mower on wildflower patches and reduces the need for petrol or diesel powered tools, the charity said.</p><p>Flowers could also share the vegetable patch with food crops in 2022, as people respond to the carbon footprint of shop-bought cut-flower bouquets by growing their own.</p><p>Plants such as cosmos, dahlias and zinnia that repeatedly flower could be grown for summer displays, while sea lavender and everlasting flower work well for winter in dried flower arrangements.</p><p>Guy Barter, chief horticulturist for the RHS, said: “Many of the new recruits to the ranks of gardeners and, indeed, those that have long tended to houseplants and outdoor plots are embracing new ways of growing as their skills and interest develops.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">The bright colours of Crocosmia will be on trend next year (Nicola Stocken/RHS/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>This, he said, could include “investing in cold frames, raised beds, conservatories, greenhouses and sheds in order to grow more efficiently, tools that make light work of seasonal tasks such as pruning, and concentrating their efforts on reducing, reusing and recycling”.</p><p>“That might include putting leftovers and waste to better use in the form of composting – the perfect season to get started with leaf litter still to be found – and own-grown bouquets for indoor and outdoor enjoyment all year long.</p><p>“With a return to more normal weekday patterns in 2021, the UK’s gardeners are adapting their approach to tending their plants; drawing on quick fixes where necessary but all the time working to ensure their plots are planet friendly and an inspiring place to work and play.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 00:01:00 GMT</pubDate><guid>2656110613</guid><media:content

hoard</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/mystery-bishops-name-found-on-rare-rock-crystal-jar-in-viking-age-hoard</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Conservators have found the name of a bishop inscribed on a rare rock crystal jar that was part of a Viking Age hoard discovered by a metal detectorist.</p><p>Experts discovered the words “Bishop Hyguald had me made” on the base of the jar, which is around 5cm high and resembles an ornate perfume bottle.</p><p>When it was discovered with the hoard in a field in Dumfries and Galloway in 2014, the jar was wrapped in textiles and when first examined it could not be seen clearly.</p><p>However, 3D X-ray imaging produced in partnership with the British Museum allowed the object to be investigated within its wrapping without damaging it and revealed that there was a Latin inscription on the base.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">The inscription was on the base of the jar (Neil Hanna/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>The words, spelled out in gold letters, translate as “Bishop Hyguald had me made”.</p><p>Experts said it is the clearest evidence that some of the material in the hoard may have come from a church in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which included Dumfries and Galloway, and stretched as far north as Edinburgh and as far south as Sheffield.</p><p>However, so far nothing is known about the mystery bishop.</p><p>Professor Alex Woolf, a senior lecturer in history at the University of St Andrews, said:  “The inscription is in Latin, which was the universal language of the Western Church in those days.</p><p>“The sources and records of the period are incomplete, but what we do know from them is that there were several ecclesiastics in early Medieval Northumbria with the name Hyguald.</p><p>“We don’t know of a Bishop Hyguald, specifically, but our lists of Northumbrian bishops are incomplete after 810.</p><p>“It is accordingly – and frustratingly – difficult to be more precise but it may well be that what we’re looking at is an otherwise undocumented mid-9th-century bishop of either Whithorn or Hexham.”</p><p>The jar is thought to have had an ecclesiastical function and the rock crystal part could have been 500 years old by the time it was wrapped in gold in the late 8th or early 9th century.</p><p>Buried at the start of the 10th century, the Galloway Hoard comprised more than 100 objects, including gold, silver, jewellery, a rare Anglo-Saxon cross and textiles. It was acquired by National Museums Scotland (NMS) in 2017.</p><p>Most of it is on display at Kirkcudbright Galleries (until July 10, 2022) in an NMS touring exhibition supported by the Scottish Government.</p><p>However, some material that was wrapped in extremely fragile, rarely surviving textiles is undergoing careful conservation and meticulous research  as part of a three-year, £1 million Arts and Humanities Research Council-funded project led by NMS in partnership with the University of Glasgow.</p><p>Dr Martin Goldberg, principal curator of Medieval Archaeology and History at NMS, said: “It looks, from the carved surface of the Galloway Hoard rock crystal, that this was once the capital of a Corinthian-style crystal column.</p><p>“This is unique in early medieval Britain but there are parallels within the Roman Empire for objects of this type. The ones that I have seen are in the Vatican collection, where there are different forms of carved crystal columns.</p><p>“And so it was maybe 500 years old by the time it was transformed in the late 8th or early 9th century into a gold-wrapped jar.”</p><p>After leaving Kirkcudbright the exhibition will tour to Aberdeen Art Gallery from July 30 to October 23, 2022.</p><p>Dr Leslie Webster, former Keeper of Britain, Prehistory and Europe at the British Museum, said: “Rock crystal is unusual in itself. It is one of those materials that was greatly prized in the antique world, for its transparency and translucency, and so it’s associated with purity. So it was, I think even in its time, very, very special.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:32:40 GMT</pubDate><guid>2656110612</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image" url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/the-rock-crystal-jar-was-discovered-in-2014-neil-hanna-photography.jpg?id=28250841&amp;width=1200&amp;coordinates=3%2C0%2C3%2C0&amp;height=800"><media:text>The rock crystal jar was discovered in 2014 (Neil Hanna Photography)</media:text></media:content><dc:creator>Lucinda Cameron</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:16:54+00:00</dc:date><category>News</category></item><item><title>All I want for Christmas – children’s letters to Santa reveal most-coveted toys</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/all-i-want-for-christmas-childrens-letters-to-santa-reveal-most-coveted-toys</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Royal Mail has revealed this year’s most-wanted presents after receiving thousands of letters from children to Santa.</p><p>Favourites such as Lego, Playmobil and Barbie are all in the top 10, as well as board games and Scalextric.</p><p>The Playmobil range tops this year’s list, with the Barbie Dream House taking second spot.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">The Barbie Dream House is the second most-wanted toy this Christmas, according to Royal Mail (Hamleys/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit...">PA Media - Hamleys</small></p><p>The findings come from Royal Mail’s analysis of many of the thousands of letters sent to Santa.</p><p>The top 10 most requested toys of 2021 were listed as:</p><p>1.

There are many forms, from ballet to hip-hop, so the way in which you dance isn’t as important – I can dance as a deaf wheelchair user, even if that’s different to some of the mainstream dancing techniques.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Deaf dancer Jasper Williams says Rose Ayling-Ellis has shown society that deaf people can thrive in the right dancing environment with appropriate access in place (Jasper Williams/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>Mr Williams said her victory would prove that “with the right partnership, such as Rose and Gio, deaf and hearing people can work together”.</p><p>“Not in spite of being deaf, because deaf is a positive thing, but that their deafness will actually help them, to think in creative ways and work around society obstacles,” he added.</p><p>The show has boosted the public’s interest in learning British Sign Language (BSL), and Mr Williams said many of his friends have recently signed up for a course too.</p><p>Paige Parsons, 29, from Redcar and Cleveland in North Yorkshire, was born profoundly deaf and has been taking part in dance classes from a young age.</p><p>She said it has been difficult in the past to explain to hearing people that she used vibrations to listen and later became able to hear music and lyrics through years of practice.</p><p>“Now whenever people do ask, I direct them to the videos of Rose and Gio dancing and just say ‘exactly like that’,” she said.</p><p>Ms Parsons said she had a soft spot for Ayling-Ellis because “we’ve come from the same place, we’ve gone through pretty much the same kind of struggles, likely heard the same kind of ableism or hate thrown at us just for being deaf.”</p><p>Her victory would “prove to the haters that they’re wrong – deaf people can hear music and goddamn, we can dance too”, she added.</p><p>Charlotte Joyce, 35, an administration officer at a further education college from Watford in Hertfordshire, said Ayling-Ellis has inspired millions of people to consider how to adapt communication through BSL at an important time.</p><p>She said: “Deaf people have really struggled in everyday life with communicating due to masks being worn and being unable to lipread or see facial expressions, which are so important to facilitate communication.</p><p>“Seeing Rose and Giovanni incorporate BSL into their dance routine as part of the storyline felt euphoric because that has never happened before and millions of deaf people were able to understand the context without any words being spoken at all.</p><p>“The ‘silent moment’ was such an incredibly beautiful and poignant moment, because my family and friends turned to me and said ‘I didn’t know what you go through with your hearing loss and now I understand’.”</p><p>Paula Garfield, the founder of Deafinitely Theatre – the UK’s first deaf-led theatre company that runs the youth theatre Ayling-Ellis trained at, said her achievement will “open doors to many more young deaf people”.</p><p>She said: “My hope is that this will also inspire parents of deaf children to learn sign language to communicate directly with their children. Deaf children and young adults encounter so many barriers everyday, and this must change.”</p><p>Sam Caiels, deaf studies coordinator at Hamilton Lodge – a school for deaf children in Brighton, said: “The Deaf Community has always valued BSL but now more and more people are realising this too. Hopefully the new interest in learning BSL will grow and grow.”</p><p>She said Ayling-Ellis has given deaf people “the confidence to believe in ourselves”.</p><p>Ms Caiels added that it was “such a proud moment” to see a video message from pupils and staff at Hamilton Lodge broadcast on Strictly.</p><p>Liam O’Dell, 24, a deaf freelance journalist and campaigner from Bedfordshire, told PA: “Throughout this series, Rose has completely smashed stereotypes around deafness and delivered stunning dances in the process.</p><p>“As well as casually illustrating what life is like as a deaf person – a ‘joy’, to use her words – she’s shown that with the right support, deaf people can achieve anything.</p><p>“If Rose wins tonight, it won’t be ‘because of’ her deafness, it will be because of the incredible teamwork between her and Giovanni, to take down any barriers and challenges which came their way during the competition.”</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Disabled rights campaigner Michaela Hollywood says she sees herself reflected in Strictly’s first deaf contestant (Michaela Hollywood/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p>That sentiment was echoed by disabled rights campaigner Michaela Hollywood, 31, from Crossgar, who has the congenital muscle wasting condition spinal muscular atrophy and was born with no inner or outer ears.</p><p>She said: “What I’ve loved most is the fact it hasn’t been what we call ‘inspiration porn’ and making Rose inspiring because she’s deaf. But inspiring through dance which is something very big.”</p><p>Ms Hollywood added that seeing Ayling-Ellis use sign language and talking had spoken to her as someone with an “unusual identity within the community”.</p><p>“This is the first time in my 31 years I’ve seen someone remotely like me on Strictly and we need more of it in the diversity revolution.”</p><p></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption..."></small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit..."></small></p><p></p><p>Danielle Hudson, a phlebotomist from Great Yarmouth, said: “I’ve been partially deaf since I was five, I’m now 40 – I wear hearing aids and have had surgery.</p><p>“It’s been amazing watching rose she is inspirational for those with disabilities proving that you can do or be anything and it doesn’t hold you back.</p><p>“I work in the NHS as a phlebotomist and I’ve proved that it doesn’t hold you back.”</p>]]></description><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 18:26:10 GMT</pubDate><guid>2656110609</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image" url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/deaf-dancer-jasper-williams-says-rose-ayling-ellis-has-broken-stereotypes-jasper-williams-pa.jpg?id=28255147&amp;width=1200&amp;coordinates=0%2C240%2C0%2C240&amp;height=800"><media:text>Deaf dancer Jasper Williams says Rose Ayling-Ellis has broken stereotypes (Jasper Williams/PA)</media:text></media:content><dc:creator>Sophie Wingate</dc:creator><dc:creator>Edd Dracott</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:16:49+00:00</dc:date><category>News</category></item><item><title>In Pictures: Sandy santas race along beach for annual pudding chase</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/in-pictures-sandy-santas-race-along-beach-for-annual-pudding-chase</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Santas and elves of all ages raced into Christmas celebrations in Weymouth with the annual Chase the Pudding beach run.</p><p>Mr and Mrs Pudding were chased along Weymouth beach by hundreds of sandy Santas in a fundraising event for the Will Mackaness Trust.</p><p>Adults could take part in a 5km run, while a Chase the Elf race of 2km was put on for under-14s.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">(Ben Birchall/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit...">PA Wire/PA Images -

Faulkner.</p><p>The first two cards show off her famous anthropomorphic style of illustrating animals – one from the V&amp;A’s collection depicts a rabbit inspired by her pet, the “charming rascal” Benjamin Bouncer delivering Christmas post, while one on loan from the National Trust features guinea pigs dressed in school uniform, chasing after their mother.</p><p>Going on display for the first time in 20 years, the third card is a hand-drawn prototype for an “elaborate” card requested by Hildesheimer &amp; Faulkner showing an autumnal scene of a field mouse in a nest of leaves.</p><p>It was never printed widely after publishers instead selected an illustration of mice in a coconut.</p><p>Annemarie Bilclough, the museum’s curator of illustration, and Frederick Warne, curator of the exhibition, said: “We are delighted to be able to include an original design and two examples of Christmas cards printed from designs by Beatrix Potter, her first commercially sold illustrations.</p><p>“The cards such are an important part of the story of Beatrix’s journey to becoming an author- illustrator and the success of the cards speaks to her practical mind and business acumen.”</p><p><em>– Beatrix Potter: Drawn To Nature runs from February 12 2022 to January 8 2023.</em></p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 08:14:27 GMT</pubDate><guid>2656110605</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image" url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/a-christmas-card-designed-by-beatrix-potter-in-the-early-1890s-showing-three-guinea-pigs-in-schoolboy-suits-chasing-after-their-mother-frederick-warne-co-pa.jpg?id=28261758&amp;width=1200&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0&amp;height=800"><media:text><![CDATA[A Christmas card designed by Beatrix Potter in the early 1890s, showing three guinea pigs in schoolboy suits chasing after their mother (Frederick Warne & Co/PA)]]></media:text></media:content><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:16:42+00:00</dc:date><category>News</category></item><item><title>Rose Ayling-Ellis hopes Strictly win ‘changes perception’ of hearing people</title><link>https://rebel.indy100.com/news/rose-ayling-ellis-hopes-strictly-win-changes-perception-of-hearing-people</link><description><![CDATA[<p>Rose Ayling-Ellis has said she hopes her Strictly Come Dancing win “changes the perception” of hearing people, after making history as the BBC One show’s first deaf champion.</p><p>The EastEnders actress said her victory on Saturday night “didn’t feel real” the following morning, and that she is still coming to terms with it.</p><p>The 27-year-old appeared alongside professional partner Giovanni Pernice on BBC Breakfast on Monday morning, after defeating Great British Bake Off winner John Whaite and his partner Johannes Radebe, the first all-male pairing on the show, in the weekend’s closely-fought grand final.</p><p>Showing off her trophy via video call, she said: “It is so lovely because I didn’t have that when I was growing up. I didn’t have anyone to look up to.</p><p>“But also it is important to inspire hearing people to think about what they are doing and to change their perception, so when a deaf person comes for a job interview they don’t have to panic or freak out.</p><p>“They can be like ‘They are just deaf, that’s all’ and making it accessible, like how Strictly did.</p><p>“I am really excited and I am looking forward to seeing what happens next and how it will carry on.”</p><p>Ayling-Ellis said her Sunday had been “very weird” after lifting the Glitterball trophy.</p><p>She added: “It was very quiet and I felt like ‘What just happened?’ It didn’t feel real.”</p><p>Italian pro Pernice, who joined Strictly in 2015 but had not previously won a series, told the programme he had slept with his trophy.</p><p>The 31-year-old said the pair had enjoyed “a fantastic journey from the beginning”.</p><p>He added: “I think we put out there a big, big statement.</p><p>“Every time I say to Rose the same thing.</p><p>“Obviously it is nice to win the show but I think we managed to put a statement – very important for Rose, very important for the deaf community.</p><p>“Every week we would go there, we would smash our dance and we just proved everything is possible.”</p><p>Pernice said he is “beyond proud” to have danced alongside Ayling-Ellis and, speaking about accessibility, added: “We all should start to push ourselves to include the deaf community and not just the deaf community – anything else.</p><p>“If I did it for 13 weeks, everybody can.”</p><p>Following her win, Ayling-Ellis was pictured sharing an emotional embrace with her mother and said she had supported her throughout her life.</p><p>“When I won it I was so shocked I couldn’t speak,” she said.</p><p>“And then, after, everyone came up to me and said ‘Well done’ and when my mum hugged me I just burst into tears. I just couldn’t stop crying.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"><small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="add caption...">Rose Ayling-Ellis beat John Whaite in the final (BBC/PA)</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="add photo credit...">PA Media - Guy Levy/BBC</small></p><p>“I was proper sobbing and I think it is because, at primary school and nursery school – it goes way, way, way back – where my education was difficult, and my mum had to fight a lot to make it accessible for my education right from the start. So I had that right from the beginning.</p><p>“Everything I do was constantly fighting, constantly a battle, to get what I needed. We just didn’t expect it would end up with me on Strictly Come Dancing and end up with me winning it. I can’t word how much that means because we have come far.”</p><p>Addressing her plans for the future, the actress said she will embark on the Strictly live tour with Pernice and then return to EastEnders.</p><p>During the live final – which went ahead without contestant AJ Odudu, who pulled out on Friday due to an ankle injury – both couples performed three dances.</p><p>Both pairs ended up with matching scores from the judges, with both receiving a perfect 40 for their revisited favourite dances and their showdances.</p><p>However, the panel’s marks did not count towards the final result, which was solely down to the public vote.</p><p>An average of 11 million people watched the final, giving BBC One a 57.8% share in the overnight ratings.</p>]]></description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 09:24:37 GMT</pubDate><guid>2656110604</guid><media:content type="image/png" medium="image" url="https://rebel.indy100.com/media-library/giovanni-pernice-and-rose-ayling-ellis-with-the-glitterball-trophy-guy-levy-bbc-pa.jpg?id=28261756&amp;width=1200&amp;coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C1&amp;height=800"><media:credit>PA Media - Guy Levy/BBC</media:credit><media:text>Giovanni Pernice and Rose Ayling-Ellis with the Glitterball trophy (Guy Levy/BBC/PA)</media:text></media:content><dc:creator>Alex Green</dc:creator><dc:date>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:16:41+00:00</dc:date><category>News</category></item>
