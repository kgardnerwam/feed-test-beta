<h1 class="fl-title">Stop moaning about how commercial Pride is</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">There’s a crucial difference between pink pound marketing – however tacky or cynical it may be – and pinkwashing. It’s time to pick our battles</h3>

<p><span>Complaining about Pride being too commercial has become a June tradition in its own right. Which is understandable: corporate Pride is unequivocally bad. But much of this criticism is so glib and superficial that it ends up conflating real problems with inane nonsense that we simply don’t need to care about. And while I’d never dream of telling anyone to stop complaining, if you’re not doing anything to support the many cooler, cheaper and more fun alternatives to Pride, which already exist all over the country, then there might be better uses for your time.</span></p>
<p><span></span><span>Corporate Pride sucks, but the discourse around it is often muddled. Take the concept of ‘</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/opinion/pinkwashing-and-israels-use-of-gays-as-a-messaging-tool.html"><span>pinkwashing</span></a><span>’. The term was coined in 1985, as a way for women with breast cancer to critique companies which claimed to support them while profiting from their illness. It was then used in relation to LGBTQ+ issues by the Palestine solidarity movement: in this context, it referred to Israel’s cynical exploitation of gay rights to present a progressive image and conceal its oppressive policies. As time went on, the term became more widely deployed to refer to the practice of violent governments or corporations appropriating LGBTQ+ issues to launder their reputations. The crucial component of pinkwashing is that it’s a smokescreen used to deflect attention from something else. This could apply to </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/opinion/pinkwashing-and-israels-use-of-gays-as-a-messaging-tool.html"><span>Israel</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2021/06/04/big-oil-is-awash-in-rainbows-for-pride-month_partner/"><span>oil companies</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://tribunemag.co.uk/2021/06/theres-no-place-for-arms-companies-in-lgbt-liberation"><span>arms dealerships</span></a><span>, but doesn’t really make sense as a framework to discuss Marks amp; Spencers releasing an <a href="https://www.marksandspencer.com/ie/c/food/not-just-any-food/food-news/pride-sandwich">LGBT-themed sandwich</a>.</span></p><p><span>Yet, nowadays, the term ‘pinkwashing’ is regularly used to disparage any LGBTQ-related marketing campaign – from black-and-white Skittles to food delivery apps offering tips for a bottom-friendly diet. We can dislike these PR stunts on the basis that they are corny and pandering, but it’s unhelpful to collapse them together with the more insidious ways that Pride month is exploited. Burger King releasing –</span><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2022/06/15/ad-agency-apologises-over-burger-king-top-and-bottom-pride-whoppers-16834422/"><span> and having to apologise for</span></a><span> – a set of burgers where both buns are ‘tops’ or ‘bottoms’ isn’t the same thing as the Israeli government presenting itself as a queer utopia to distract from its brutal military occupation, nor is it equivalent to the Home Office adding a rainbow to its Twitter profile at the same time it’s </span><a href="/politics/article/53165/1/the-gross-grim-irony-of-the-uk-home-offices-pride-rebrand"><span>deporting queer asylum seekers</span></a><span>. There’s a crucial difference between pink-pound marketing, however tacky or cynical, and pinkwashing. The first category is annoying and patronising but ultimately merits little response beyond an eye-roll; the second is actually important and worth devoting energy to fighting. Eliding the difference between the two leads to a trivialising effect, where a taco chain posting a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/chipotletweets/status/614503885500231680?lang=en"><span>gauche tweet </span></a><span>is afforded the same significance as an </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/"><span>apartheid regime </span></a><span>marketing itself as a gay travel destination in order to bolster its image. We don’t have to care about these things equally.</span></p>
<p><span>It’s fine to be against corporate Pride, but we should endeavour to be actively for something too. P</span><span>eople often pine for a bygone era when </span><span>Pride</span><span> was radical, which is all well and good but you can’t expect a counterculture to be handed to you on a plate by corporate-sponsored events. All over Britain, groups of people have responded to a lack of diversity in mainstream Pride events by starting something new. </span><a href="/life-culture/article/50800/1/lady-phyll-charts-history-of-uk-black-pride-movement-black-lives-matter-video"><span>UK Black Pride</span></a><span>, which was launched in 2005, is now Europe’s largest celebration of African, Asian, Middle Eastern, Latin American and Caribbean-heritage LGBTQ+ people. There are also several </span><a href="/life-culture/article/53337/1/see-how-london-turned-it-out-for-a-joyful-trans-pride-march"><span>Trans Pride</span></a><span> events, most notably in London and Brighton: when you recall Pride in London’s</span><a href="/politics/article/40635/1/pride-in-london-anti-trans-protestors-remember-its-history"><span> failure to prevent </span></a><span>a gang of transphobes from hi-jacking its parade in 2018, it’s clear that these alternatives are sorely needed. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.freepride.gay"><span>Free Pride</span></a><span>, based in Glasgow, was started in 2015 after the city’s mainstream event began charging people to attend (including a £60 VIP ticket), as well as being strictly policed, corporate-focused, and overwhelmingly white and cis. “Transness, gender variation, spaces for Black or disabled LGBTQ people weren’t being taken into consideration at all,” the organisers tell Dazed. “We decided to offer a space for celebration, partying and fun, but also for learning. We introduced workshops about sex work, police abolition, and different aspects of trans identities.”</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

                </div>
<p><span>Free Pride, and other events like it is, is an attempt to repoliticise the tradition. “It’s always been important for us to take positions on issues like Palestine or migrant detention, and to draw attention to how those struggles intersect with queer liberatory politics,” they explain. In contrast, Glasgow Pride’s 2015 slogan was “#BeHappy”. “However political we are, it’s not all doom and gloom,” say the Free Pride organisers. “There’s a lot of righteous anger but it’s primarily a space to connect, learn from and party with other LGTBQ people.” Alongside the focus on organising and activism, club nights have always been a key part of what Free Pride does, with a major focus on accessibility. All of their parties are pay-what-you-can (starting from free), held in accessible venues, and offer quiet spaces and taxi funds. “I’m not claiming by any means we’ve managed to achieve full accessibility,” they say, “but we have tried to make parties more accessible for disabled or trans people.”</span></p>
<p><span>Free Pride does what it does extremely well, but it’s not an isolated case. There are events like this happening in most British cities, and many of them offer the exact spirit which people claim to be hankering for when they bemoan Pride’s commercialism. At this point, the mainstream event feels like a lost cause, which isn’t to say it’s a space we should abandon entirely: protesting the presence of police is worthwhile, and we should absolutely care when the language and aesthetics of the LGBTQ+ movement are used as a PR shield by repressive governments and corrupt corporations. But if what we are objecting to is a more generic commercialism, our energies might be better directed towards building and supporting alternatives, instead of just… tweeting. “The feeling that we all have at Free Pride is that the corporate event is always going to exist and we’re not opposed to the idea of it existing. That’s fine… well, I don’t think it’s fine but it does exist and c’est la vie!” says one of the organisers. “And while things like that do exist, it’s imperative that we have an alternative. We can bitch about corporate Pride all day long, because it sucks, but there are better options available.”</span></p>
<p><span>It’s fair enough to have a principled objection to rainbow capitalism in all its forms, but we shouldn’t allow ourselves to be too distracted by marketing campaigns. A lot of this stuff is just profoundly trivial and not worth our attention. “To determine whether a movement genuinely challenges the structures of economic and political power, one need only measure how affected it is by the goings-on in the fashion and advertising industries,” writes Naomi Klein in </span><em><span>No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies</span></em><span>. “If, even after being singled out as the latest fad, it continues as if nothing had happened, it’s a good bet it is a real movement. If it spawns an industry of speculation about whether movement X has lost its edge, perhaps its adherents should be looking for a sharper utensil.” Complaining about corporate Pride might be justifiable, but don’t deprive yourself of the pleasure of going to something that’s actually good.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>Annie Lord speaks before she thinks. That’s not a dig, by the way: it’s an observation she makes of herself in her debut book </span><em><span><a href="https://www.orionbooks.co.uk/titles/annie-lord/notes-on-heartbreak/9781398705487/">Notes on Heartbreak</a>, </span></em><span>a memoir about the disintegration of a five-year relationship, and it’s something she helpfully demonstrates within seconds of us meeting at her home in south London. “I was on a night out recently and I saw a guy who works out at my gym. I pointed at him and said, ‘you go to my gym!’ Obviously now I see him all the time when I’m there and it’s embarrassing – like why did I say that?” she says, shaking her head as she makes me a cup of tea.</span></p>
<p><span>While some confessional writers limit their candour to the written word, Lord’s writing – which has gained a cult following around her fortnightly dating column at Vogue.co.uk – is a refinement of her impulsive and self-deprecating approach to conversation. Our interview is littered with sentences that open with “you know when you… ” which have the gradual effect of creating identification. I find myself merging my own experience into Lord’s particular take on something; it’s as if you try her perspectives on for size, regardless of whether you think they’ll actually fit you. The creation of a shared experience is evidently key to her success in gaining a readership who see their own anxieties, triumphs and losses in love reflected in Lord’s words. </span><span>At other points in the conversation, she offhandedly delivers witheringly honest statements about herself (“I think I idealise men and put them on pedestals”) that I find myself</span><span> asking her to explain further as they’re perhaps not the things women are supposed to say out loud in an age of pastel Instagram infographic feminism.</span></p>
<p><em><span>Notes on Heartbreak </span></em><span>is her most exposing work yet and I am keen to learn about how a young writer, who has effectively turned her love life into her career, found the experience of offering up something as confusing, devastating and unedifying as heartbreak for public consumption.</span></p>
<p><strong>In flashback scenes in the book, you’re still in a long-term relationship and you’re a young, freelance journalist trying to break into the industry. You couldn’t have known then that the end of that relationship would drive you into writing about relationships and dating, from the perspective of a single woman. Do you ever find the turn your career has taken surprising?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord: </strong>It’s really weird because when I was at uni, I had a column in the uni paper about sex and relationships, which I haven’t re-read because I think they’d be mortifying to read now. I’d rattle on about the </span><em><span>Kama Sutra</span></em><span> in the student paper. Then when I got into journalism I was told not to use ‘I’ and go out and talk to people and find interesting angles so it’s funny it’s gone back to writing about myself. It feels like something I haven’t actively chosen. But then I think, with writing, you can’t pick what you’re good at writing about. When I have written about myself and love, it seems to resonate with people. It’s a complicated thing to be good at, though.</span></p><p><strong>The idea for the book and the </strong><strong><em>Vogue</em></strong><strong> column both came from a viral </strong><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a35nw8/getting-over-a-long-term-relationship-break-up"><strong>essay</strong></a><strong> you wrote about your breakup in the immediate aftermath. Why did you decide to write that at the time?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord: </strong>I think, at that point, all I could think about was the breakup. I write in the book about how distraction from a breakup doesn’t help at all. You just end up feeling like you’re thinking about it even more. So I could only write about the breakup, basically. Writing about it really helped because it felt like I was still sitting in bed crying all day, but now it was also work. It wasn’t something I consciously thought about like, ‘I will be open about this and help people.’ But I was really surprised when loads of people were enjoying it. Because I guess when you’re in a breakup, you always think whatever you’re going through is so unique and romantic and special and different. It was nice because everyone was saying, ‘oh my god, I felt exactly the same!’ but it was also frustrating: I was thinking, ‘did you [feel the same]? Because I think I was feeling it more!’</span></p>
<p><strong>In the book you quote Joan Didion’s famous line, ‘We tell ourselves stories in order to live.’ Though people often forget that in the essay it comes from she adds, ‘at least we do for a while.’ </strong><strong>I think breakups are often about repeated attempts to draft and redraft a satisfactory narrative of why a relationship played out the way it did until, ultimately, you just stop caring.</strong><strong> Your book dramatises this and plays with literary form: for example, you intersperse the narrative with passages written in the second person, addressed directly to your ex. How did that come about?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord: </strong>I genuinely make sense of things by writing them down. When it [the breakup] happened, I did that really classic thing of writing a love letter. It was about 3,000 words and it was just a stream of consciousness of memories, a crazy mind map of what had happened so that I could make sense of it. I never sent my ex the letter but I feel like those parts of the book evolved out of that. The person I’m speaking to directly [in those sections] is a really idealised version of someone and as time passes my view of them becomes a bit more realistic as I was able to handle the truth of it and see the situation as a three-dimensional thing. The stories I would tell myself at the start to stop it hurting, like  ‘oh, I was just too much for him. He wants someone easier,’ or ‘oh, he’s just going through a personal crisis and he’s taking it out on me because I’m the easiest thing to let go of.’ I’d almost repeat those stories to myself as affirmations. But by the time it comes to the end of the book, I instead have a real conversation with him as he actually is rather than a version that’s all romantic and sepia-toned.</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><strong>I think we don’t take the grief of heartbreak particularly seriously as a society, relative to how devastating it actually is. I noticed a lot of the literary references you cite in the book to express your feelings were originally written about grief as we traditionally understand it – linked to bereavement. Perhaps some will think that’s overdramatic. Do you think grief is the right framing for how a breakup feels?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord: </strong>I am someone that really likes to sit in a feeling and so after my breakup I really only wanted to read or watch things about breakups and every book I read was either a self-help book, like ‘let’s get you back on the horse,’ or began so long after the fact – maybe because the pain is so hard to describe. Otherwise, it ends with them getting back together – which makes you feel so shit if you’re not able to. Whereas I would resonate more with books about grief. I’m not saying they’re comparable but people tend to sit in the exact feelings of grief more. For example, I really liked a bit in CS Lewis’ book about grief [</span><em><span>A Grief Observed</span></em><span>] where he says that grief is like suspense because you’re constantly looking around to see or hear them. I remember thinking, ‘that’s what I’m going through.’ Unlike grief, though, heartbreak feels awful but it goes. You only grow around the grief that comes from death, it doesn’t get any smaller. Whereas it’s mad how terrible heartbreak is and you feel you’re never going to get through it but you do.</span></p>
<p><strong>Heterosexual women often have a cultural script to follow about breakups – one your book perhaps contributes to – where it’s like men instigate them either directly or by bad behaviour and then women process them – often with other women – and gradually recover a sense of lost agency. Do you think it’s easier, in some ways, for women to deal with breakups than men? Because there is almost like an archetype for what we’re supposed to think and feel and the process that we’re supposed to go through?</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord:</strong> Definitely. Even thinking about my male friends… I was actually listening to an episode of </span><em><span>The Receipts</span></em><span> podcast where Tolly says something like, ‘A relationship’s only over when the woman’s done with it.’  I feel like that’s quite true. Because men never do that processing of it. They never get any closure. So for them, the door never shuts. I think eventually women just hit this point where they’re sick of it.</span></p>
<p><span>I definitely think being a woman and being on the ‘dumped’ end of a breakup means you can get so much sympathy and support. Even when I said, ‘I don’t think I was very sympathetic to things he was going through,’ people would be like, ‘no, he’s a bellend,’ or whatever. And I don’t think that’s helpful sometimes because if you are just a victim and you’ve done absolutely nothing wrong, it does remove any agency because then you can’t do anything to make it right. It’s quite nice knowing that you were part of it ending. I was conscious of that when writing the book. I didn’t want to write a revenge story. I think it’s more interesting that way. I did try to really confront ways in which I fucked things up: like not setting boundaries or cutting myself off from friends or being needy. I wanted to confront those things.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“I think, with writing, you can’t pick what you’re good at writing about. When I have written about myself and love, it seems to resonate with people. It’s a complicated thing to be good at, though” – Annie Lord</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Confronting yourself in that way raises the question of whether you think there’s a risk in writing about relationships and dating when it necessarily involves interpreting men’s behaviour!</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord:</strong> It’s weird actually, a couple of times I’ve spoken to male friends for the column and quoted them [about why men might behave a certain way in dating]. And when they say stuff, I’m never satisfied with what they’re saying. Sometimes I feel I’m like, ‘no, I get you more than you get you,’ or ‘yeah, that’s not it.’ It just feels like the explanation a lot of men use for stuff feels very simple. Maybe they are simple but it feels like it can’t be that. But sometimes you are making yourself feel better via a very complex explanation for [men’s] actions that make out that you’re still hot and desirable, and they still want to have sex with you, and go out with you. It's just these external factors [preventing it].</span></p>
<p><strong>Finally, you’ve managed to make a success of writing about the highs and lows of love using your own life. Do you feel like you’ve chosen to avoid serious relationships for the sake of this writing? Do you foresee a point where you might stop?</strong><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Annie Lord: </strong>There is a weird thing that happens where something bad [in dating] happens and you’re already thinking about how you might write about them and your life feels like a story. It feels like not being in your life but seeing it as a spectator and recording it. I don’t feel embarrassed when I’m writing about myself because I’m a massive oversharer even in person, but it does affect how other people see me which is crap. I don’t want people to think I’m writing about them all the time. If men read the column they know what I think about so many things. It’s not very sexy because I can’t be mysterious. If you’re seeing a guy you want him to think you have loads of options, but that doesn’t work if he can read that you don’t. I think in the future I would still like to write about myself because I enjoy it but maybe it might be less dating-focused. That said, I’m obsessed with relationships and love. I think if I met the right person and they weren’t comfortable being written about I would give up the column, though that would be difficult because they’d probably say they were uncomfortable on about date three and I still wouldn’t know if I was going to fall for them enough to give it up? In your teens and early twenties, it feels like the career is the thing you should never give up on and nothing comes before that. Now I’m more established I think I could make something else happen if I didn’t have the column. Men are the disappearing, impossible thing now rather than work.</span></p>

<p><span>After two years of COVID delays, Primavera Sound made its triumphant return this month at Barcelona’s brutalist Parc del Fòrum. Celebrating its belated 20th anniversary, the festival was split across two successive weekends, with thousands of fans old and new keen to get in on the impressively stacked line-up that ranged from massive pop acts – <a href="/tag/dua-lipa">Dua Lipa</a>, <a href="/tag/megan-thee-stallion">Megan Thee Stallion</a> and <a href="/tag/lorde">Lorde</a> – to some of electronic music’s hottest DJs. For those who missed it, we’ve rounded up our favourite six moments from the festival – enjoy!</span></p><h1><span>GRIMES PLAYED A RAUCOUS DJ SET</span></h1>
<p><span>Packed out doesn’t even describe the turnout for <a href="/tag/grimes">Grimes</a>’ DJ set at the festival, the rest of the site must have been a ghost town for the hour she played. Bar a few hairy blends (we’ve all been there) and the questionable choice to drop Mariah Carey’s “All I Want For Christmas Is You“ in the middle of a 2AM techno set, she was a certified crowd-pleaser, jumping seamlessly from banger to banger as the audience regularly screamed in approval. She seemed to be having just as much fun as the rest of the crowd, climbing on the decks and mixing upside down, thrashing around in the wind machine and dancing around the stage to herself. <em>(NK)</em></span></p>
<h1><span>THE WHOLE NTS RAVE DUNGEON SET UP</span></h1>
<p><span>I think it’s safe to admit that sometimes the open-air set-up at festivals just isn’t conducive to the vibes of a more intimate, sweaty, bass-heavy DJ set. It’s hard to find dark corners to immerse yourself fully and drown out the commotion that might be happening around you. This year, Primavera succeeded in bringing the club to the festival in collaboration with NTS with a new stage addition that sought to remedy this. Nestled underneath the huge solar panel structure, the elusive dungeon setup saw DJs and artists like Anz, VTSS and Erika De Casier draw massive crowds and long queues. <em>(NK)</em></span></p>	<figure>

<h1><span>CAN’T GO WRONG WITH BICEP</span></h1>
<p><span>Less of a highlight, more of a mantra. If Bicep have a million fans, I am one of them. If Bicep have ten fans, I am one of them. If Bicep have only one fan, that fan is me. If Bicep have no fans, that means I am no longer on this Earth. If the world is against the Bicep, I am against the world. Jokes aside, the Northern Irish duo are a festival lineup mainstay at this point which can sometimes dim an act’s allure because it feels less “exclusive” somehow. But as crowds flocked to and filled up the entire Cupra auditorium and beyond, the producer-DJ’s proved exactly why they’re booked time and time again with a typically transcendent set. <em>(NK)</em></span></p>
<h1><span>BURNA BOY amp; THE TOPLESS AGENDA</span></h1>
<p><span>African music talent admittedly didn’t have an incredible showing on this year’s Primavera lineup, especially given its recent international commercial success with the likes of CKay’s Love Nwatiti and Wizkid and Tems’ Essence. Most of it ended up relegated to the stages at the far, far end of the festival, typically reserved for late-night electronic sets. Fortunately, though, the distance didn’t stop <a href="/tag/burna-boy">Burna Boy</a> from drawing a huge crowd of fans who were down to make the pilgrimage and the African Giant’s set was a welcome change of pace for a late Friday night. The Tous stage was overflowing as the Nigerian star delivered anthem after anthem including Killin’ Dem and Anybody before encouraging everyone in the crowd to follow his lead and take their tops off for the universally understood Ye. <em>(NK)</em></span></p>	<figure>

<h1><span>THE BOILER ROOM X CUPRA STAGE SHONE A LIGHT ON CLUB MUSIC PAST AND PRESENT</span></h1>
<p><span>The sheer range of dance music acts at this year’s Boiler Room x Cupra stage was so impressive that we’re struggling to choose one singular highlight. Festival-goers circled around the decks, located in the middle of the stage, which hosted a number of acts ranging from rap producer Kenny Beats to a five-hour courtesy of Glasgow DJ Optimo. On closing night, German producer Mechatok played a heady set featuring music from Chief Keef to Drain Gang and beyond. This was shortly followed by mysterious producer duo Two Shell, who trolled audiences with their signature chipmunk-style vocals and Kings of Leon samples. Makinera legends Pastis and Buenri also reunited for a mental hour of 90s hard trance and acid. <em>(GY)</em></span></p>
<h1><span>THE PC MUSIC SHOWCASE BROUGHT FUTURE POP TO THE FOREFRONT</span></h1>
<p><span>As part of its expanded Primavera a la Ciutat programme of club gigs, <a href="/music/article/47273/1/pc-music-a-g-cook-history-end-of-decade-2010s-retrospective">PC Music</a> held an Acid Angel showcase at Razzamatazz, featuring performances from the UK label’s stars as well as associated friends and family. Highlights included label head <a href="/tag/a-g-cook">A.G. Cook</a>, who played his signature synthesis of futurist pop and experimental electronic music. Elsewhere, <a href="/tag/100-gecs">100 gecs</a> performed their first-ever European show dressed in wizardly robes à la their </span><span>“</span><a href="/music/article/56121/1/100-gecs-shoot-for-the-stars-in-doritos-fritos-music-video"><span>Doritos amp; Fritos</span></a><span>” music video, whizzing through fan favourites like “Stupid Horse” and “Money Machine” at warp speed. Closing the night was <a href="/tag/dorian-electra">Dorian Electra</a>, whose crushing selection of fantasy hardcore and medieval samples proved for an ear-splitting finale. <em>(GY)</em></span></p>]]>

<p><span>Once upon a time, being convicted of grand larceny and theft of services would be enough to kill your prospects stone dead. But for the internet’s favourite scammer, <a href="/tag/anna-delvey">Anna Delvey</a> (aka Anna Sorokin), her conviction marked the beginning of what is now blossoming into a lucrative career.</span></p>
<p><span>With a Netflix series about her life and an </span><a href="/art-photography/article/56117/1/con-artist-anna-delvey-announces-her-first-solo-exhibition-allegedly"><span>art show</span></a><span> already under her belt, Delvey has announced her latest business venture: an exclusive collection of NFTs.</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m trying to move away from this, like, quote, unquote scammer persona,” Delvey told <em>NBC News</em>. “This is, like totally, has been pushed upon me by the prosecution and by the following media and by the Netflix show, but I’m trying to move away from that definitely.” Thank God NFTs aren’t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-wash-trading-scams-chainanalysis-report-202537095.html" data-ylk="elm:context_link;itc:0" data-rapid_p="19" data-v9y="1">a massive Ponzi scheme</a>!</span></p><p><span>To really hammer home Delvey’s pivot to a slightly more palatable form of scamming, the ten newly minted NFTs will be part of a collection called ‘Reinventing Anna’. The collection was created in collaboration with artist and animator Jonny Ryan.</span></p>
<p><span>The Reinventing Anna NFT will supposedly grant buyers access to “exclusive livestreams and other online and metaverse events.”</span></p>
<p><span>Buyers of three “ultra platinum” NFTs will also have the chance to meet Delvey in person </span><span>and have phone calls with her</span><span>, as well as </span><span>access coveted personal items from her time in prison (including <a href="https://pagesix.com/2022/06/16/anna-delvey-to-sell-signed-prison-panties-as-part-of-nft-project/">underwear</a>, according to PageSix) and some of her </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGhu2ljgEks/"><span>Louvre-worthy sketches</span></a><span>, which she currently sells for </span><a href="https://www.foundersartclub.com/shop"><span>$250 each</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Delvey served nearly four years in prison after she was found guilty of defrauding and attempting to defraud banks and hotels. </span><span>As of June 2022, she remains in ICE custody in Orange County Jail after overstaying her visa.</span></p>
<p><span>If for some insane reason you’re keen to buy into Delvey’s latest scam, you can check out her NFT collection <a href="https://www.theannadelvey.world">here</a>.</span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">WTF is happening between Mark Zuckerberg and Balenciaga</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Something Meta this way comes</h3>

<p><a href="/tag/mark-zuckerberg"><span>Mark Zuckerberg</span></a><span> is very upset! Last year he unveiled big plans to transform Facebook into Meta, including “digital outfits” for horrid little avatars. Beige slacks, yellow pantsuits, sensible blazers, and shin-length dresses, it was as if Zuckerberg had modeled the future of fashion off an episode of </span><em><span>The Apprentice</span></em><span> – only with less sex appeal and more pointed brogues. Unsurprisingly, people were left uninspired, with “</span><a href="https://twitter.com/jennyshalev/status/1488772346101919746"><span>Jenny</span></a><span>” even suggesting that whoever designed the clothes for Meta should take a styling course, and do so </span><a href="https://twitter.com/jennyshalev/status/1488772346101919746"><span>ASAP</span></a><span>!</span></p><p><span>And then – if only to make matters worse – the company’s attempt to curry favour with fashion was further thwarted when it tweeted “Hey @Balenciaga, what’s the dress code in the metaverse?” to absolutely no reply. Embarrassing! Eight months later, however, and it seems as though something, AKA a collaboration of some sort, may actually be in the works. This is what happened on Twitter yesterday afternoon:</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Can’t wait for Friday <a href="https://twitter.com/BALENCIAGA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BALENCIAGA</a></p>mdash; Meta (@Meta) <a href="https://twitter.com/Meta/status/1537443344413884416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2022</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p><span>And this is how Balenciaga replied:</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">👍</p>mdash; Balenciaga (@BALENCIAGA) <a href="https://twitter.com/BALENCIAGA/status/1537451819995041792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2022</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p><span>Someone (Eva Chen) has Demna in a headlock and they are set to make a fashion announcement that will “break the metaverse”, according to Chen’s stories. In an accompanying Instagram post, the fashion partnerships director asked her two million followers “who wore it better?” referencing a… grey t-shirt… that she has selected for an avatar that doesn't really look like her. “Going live tomorrow with @zuck to share some exciting news about avatar fashion,” the caption reads. So, it looks as though Balenciaga is now outfitting Meta, or hawking some kind of NFT, or selling a grey t-shirt. Who knows! But Zuckerberg got his way in the end. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<h1 class="fl-title">Can we talk about Beetlejuice bangs?</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Alexa Demie, Billie Eilish, Bella Hadid and now Beyoncé have been spotted rocking the jagged micro fringe</h3>

<p><span>Baby goth </span><a href="/tag/beetlejuice"><span>Lydia Deetz</span></a><span> and her spiky baby bangs and tousled, backcombed updo are turning out to be quite the beauty inspiration for the fashion girls. The look first began to creep into our lives back in February when </span><a href="/tag/alexa-demie"><span>Alexa Demie</span></a><span> sported a sharp pointy fringe for </span><em><span>The Cut</span></em><span>’s </span><em><span>Euphoria</span></em><span> cast shoot. Courtesy of </span><a href="/beauty/tag/evanie-frausto"><span>Evanie Frausto</span></a><span>, the jet black hair and jagged, separated fringe couldn’t help but be compared to the iconic </span><em><span>Beetlejuice</span></em><span> hairstyle.</span></p>
<p><span>Hot on the heels of Demie came </span><a href="/beauty/tag/billie-eilish"><span>Billie Eilish</span></a><span>, who swapped her platinum blonde hair for black at the <a href="/fashion/article/55835/1/red-carpet-grammys-2022-best-worst-looks-billie-eilish-dua-lipa-olivia-rodrigo">Grammys</a> in April. The piecey, blunt fringe and spiky 90s updo screamed Lydia Deetz, as did the hairstyle Eilish wore for the </span><a href="/beauty/tag/met-ball"><span>Met Gala</span></a><span> the following month. While the bangs were perhaps on the wispier side, the back was certainly spikey enough to draw comparisons to the Winona Ryder character – and many people </span><a href="https://twitter.com/eiffeltyler/status/1521277117815832578?s=20amp;t=RgY4FAswl-WVjrZoHwlVbA"><span>did just that</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The tributes don’t stop there though. Yesterday, </span><a href="/beauty/tag/beyonce"><span>Beyoncé</span></a><span> revealed her </span><a href="https://www.vogue.co.uk/fashion/article/beyonce-vogue-cover-new-music"><span>latest cover</span></a><span> with </span><em><span>British Vogue</span></em><span>, ahead of new music arriving next month. Photographed by Rafael Pavarotti, the shoot sees the regal singer pose on various props including a huge disco ball and a horse. In one image, hairstylist </span><a href="/beauty/tag/jawara"><span>Jawara</span></a><span> has given the singer a very uneven, zig-zag fringe. Amidst the absolute opulence of the gilded and crystal-encrusted Schiaparelli Haute Couture coat and earrings, the fringe brings a nice, edgier contrast. A mix between </span><em><span>Beetlejuice</span></em><span> and the haircut a toddler might give themselves if handed a pair of scissors. </span></p>
<p><span>While there has been a sudden influx of Lydia Deetz hair this year, the look has proved an inspiration for the fashion world before. For its A/W 2020 runway show, </span><a href="/tag/haider-ackermann"><span>Haider Ackermann</span></a><span> sent Bella Hadid down the catwalk in a huge black bouffant wig with a very spiky baby fringe. The look was completed with bleached-out eyebrows and a ghostly complexion.  </span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Listen to FKA twigs’ new heartbreak song, ‘Killer’</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">‘It’s dangerous to be a woman in love’</h3>

<div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="Ey8FAmFNAXI"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ey8FAmFNAXI" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><a href="/tag/fka-twigs">FKA twigs</a><span> has officially shared her latest single “Killer“.</span></p>
<p>The singer teased the release <a href="https://twitter.com/FKAtwigs/status/1533870508965502976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1533870508965502976%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nme.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D3241026action%3Dedit">on Twitter</a> earlier this month, describing it as a song “for baddies with a tear in their eye”.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous to be a woman in love,” twigs said. “When at its worst, the effects of heartbreak can define one’s trajectory much more than the beauty of the love itself, in my song ‘Killer’, I explore this concept.”</p>
<p><span>“The navigation, the hunt and the kill. The death of promises, dreams and the future that was once promised. But like the wildest plucked roses, I find myself more beautiful delicately wilted, in shadow, forced solace, darkened at the edges and achingly thirsting to be tended to again,” she added.</span></p>
<p><span>Twigs first premiered the song during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNodeNnXWy0amp;feature=emb_title">NPR’s Tiny Desk last week</a> while performing at London’s St. Matthias Church.</span></p>

<p><span>“Is this hell?” asks the blue-haired protagonist in digital artist LuYang’s work “The Great Adventure of Material World</span><em><span>”</span></em><span>. Set against an infinite sea of kawaii creatures, the game-film is a kaleidoscopic journey into the Shanghai-based artist’s subconscious, packed with floating Buddhas, disembodied heads and pixellated monsters. Skirting the threshold between </span><span>eternity and existence, the artwork is one of 30 games featured in </span><em><span>WORLDBUILDING: Gaming and Art in the Digital Age</span></em><span>, a gr</span><span>oup exhibition taking place at the Julia Stoschek Foundation in</span><span> Düsseldorf. C</span><span>urated by <a href="/tag/hans-ulrich-obrist">Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>, the exhibition takes an archaeological view of the medium, exploring the relationship between gaming and time-based art.</span></p>
<p><span>With computers and video games finding their way into popular culture in nearly every part of society, t</span><span>he exhibition raises questions about identity, society, autonomy, and the relationship between the physical and virtual. Featuring video, virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI) and game-based works from the mid-90s to the present day, there are e</span><span>arly works of art such as Peggy Ahwesh’s </span><span>feminist exploration o</span><span>f </span><em><span>Tomb Raider, “</span></em><span>She Puppet”,</span><span> and </span><span>Julia Stoschek’s existential take on </span><em><span>Pacman</span></em><span>, wher</span><span>e the omnivorous video-game character gets eaten by itself. </span><span>There’s also Lawrence Lek’s sinofuturist virtual world, “Nepenthe Zone”,</span><span> </span><span>and</span><span> Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley’s First Person Shooter, “SHE KEEPS ME DAMN ALIVE”, which reflects on the experience of Black and trans people, as well as Ed Fornieles’ static-soaked animation about surveillance anxiety and Thomas Webb’s dizzying AI portals.</span></p><p><span>Each artwork will evolve </span><span>over the course of the exhibition’s one-and-a-half-year run and will be accompanied by a varied programme of events, both online and on-site. “Interactivity takes a major role in many of these games, where the viewer is implicated in the way each work progresses, and how it is experienced,” says</span><span> Obrist. Below, we speak to him about the exhibition, the growing role of video games in our everyday lives, and how we can look at past interpretations of gaming to make sense of an increasingly artificial world.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>The role of video games, or more specifically online gaming, is becoming increasingly prevalent in our everyday lives, especially as platforms like Roblox and Fortnite take on a bigger role in online communication. What was the inspiration behind this exhibition and how is it relevant now?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>Last year, nearly a third of the world’s population played video games – that’s around 2.8 billion people – so obviously more and more artists are looking into this. Since the 80s, artists like Peggy Ahwesh and Rebecca Allen have brought videogames into art practice and critically looked at these videogames, which were developed by a small and intimate group of people coming mostly from an engineering perspective. Over the last few years, we’ve seen people going into existing videogames and using them less as videogames and more as a platform. </span><span>One example is the Serpentine’s exhibition on </span><em><span>Fortnite</span></em><span>, which was viewed by 100-150 million people. Many people then will never have been to a museum with that visit actually the exhibition physically. We’ve also seen Rosaliá do it with fashion and Ariana Grande with pop music.</span></p>
<p><span>But there’s another reason I wanted to do the show, which is that we now have artists inventing their own games. They’re making their own with rules and surrounding systems. This means that new worlds are emerging. Now, with technology being more accessible, we’re seeing a plurality of voices as games come from a wider set of experiences and present a wider range of perspectives. They’re not manufactured for a specific audience, but rather for the benefit of peers.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>How do you think the mainstream-ification of videogames is shaping artwork – and culture more generally?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>It brings completely new audiences to exhibitions. More and more exhibitions are becoming mixed-reality, because there’s the work we actually see in the show and other digital props like lighting in immersive installations and multiscreen installations, which function as almost an extension of the body. We will have a digital path and an analogue path in a similar way to how some AI glasses allow us to experience physical experiences but you also have the possibility to augment them. We’re only five to ten years away from having AI glasses embedded into our normal lenses.</span></p>
<p><span>The mainstream-ification of games means they can also be mission-driven. It’s interesting just how many of these artists are interested in multiplayer games in terms of participation, like what kind of mission is it, whether that’s the relation to human extinction or the environmental crisis.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does the exhibition take an archaeological look at video games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>There’s a lot of 3D involved and there’s also a lot of connection between the games and the metaverse. But, for some artists, there’s also a desire to look at the just past. Walter Benjamin describes that amnesia often happens in relation to the just past, so it’s interesting how some of the artists in the exhibition are interested in looking at the old games, 2D games, and revisiting them. That‘s contrasted in the show, so we have both. The future is somehow invented, sometimes using fragments from the past.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“The future is sometimes invented using fragments from the past” – Hans Ulrich Obrist</span><span></span><span></span></p>
</blockquote><p><strong>I’ve been noticing a lot of nostalgia for the early internet lately, especially post-pandemic. I suppose this will only increase as society gets more and more online. This also applies to gaming, as a younger generation discovers games from the 80s and 90s via the internet. Have you noticed this? Why do you think this is?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>Some of these early games remain really powerful. Some of these games appear very simple, but there are more complex structures involved that almost function as psychological devices, where you’re in a virtual or mental space that changes reality and transforms into something else.</span></p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on the metaverse given that nearly all metaverse tech is built on gaming infrastructure?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>There’s clearly a connection with video games. </span><span>Édouard Glissant </span><span>talks about the fact that you should think about it as archipelagos, which is why I’m quoting Anna Anthropy from the Rise of the Videogame Zinesters, especially in terms of the plurality of voices. </span><span>Glissant</span><span> talks about the archipelago as opposed to the continent, as continents are homogenised, whereas the archipelago is what we should learn from: what we can change in exchange with the Other, and through that, my reality becomes more complex. The question with the metaverse is: will it be a continent or an archipelago? Particularly with the commercial forces at stake, there’s a race that maybe one entity will win. Then we’ll have a continental metaverse, which I don’t think will necessarily be beneficial. What will be more relevant or productive to think about the metaverse as a very immersive virtual world that is an archipelago, where different parallel realities will be connected, rather than one homogenised continent.</span></p>
<p><span>The whole idea of the metaverse </span><span>comes from science fiction, with Neil Stevenson’s </span><em><span>Snow Crash,</span></em><span> and also the entire idea of virtual reality was pioneered by Jaron Zepel Lanier, who was a programmer and a writer.</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><strong>What you’re saying about continents makes me think of the corporate rat race currently taking place to colonise online forms of communication, where Web3 is trying to break free from that homogenised way of thinking.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>An archipelago is a relational reality. It is a place that is particular to us; a place where we are and also a place where we are bound.</span></p>
<p><strong>I saw that you have works by </strong><strong>Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley and LuYang in the exhibition – both artists who explore the role of identity and gender through technology. </strong><strong>What role do video games play in exploring identity?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>Danielle says that she uses technology to imagine our lives in environments that centre our bodies; those that are living, those that are past, and those that have been forgotten.  Her Black Trans Archive is a very important work; it's a video game that interacts in real-time. In history, black people have been erased and absent from archives, so in a way, this game is actually a game that centres on black and trans people and their stories, which is really important. With LuYang, through the Doku avatar, which is a digital incarnation that she’s been working on since 2020, that any form of binary thinking is radically challenged by the avatar. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“I was thinking about what would be the Rite of Spring of the 21st century – and maybe it’s going to be a videogame“ – Hans Ulrich Obrist</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How do you see the relationship between our digital selves and our Away From Keyboard selves?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>Elmgreen amp; Dragset’s book </span><em><span>Useless Bodies </span></em><span>just came out at the Prada Foundation, which is about the crash of the bubble in the digital age. Increasingly, we’re seeing exhibitions become mixed reality. We have an exhibition at the Serpentine with Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, </span><em><span>Alienarium 5</span></em><span>, with ‘Alienarium’ being the key figure in Dominique’s sculptures. She’s developed a multisensory sort of environment, where there are a lot of things we experience in front of a screen. She’s created all these different sorts of formats. We have a 360-degree panorama, there are five VR pieces where we can have encounters with extraterrestrials, and there’s also a room that’s disconnected from any technology. It’s combining many of these parallel realities in human experience, which is multi-sensory and that people can spend a lot of time.</span></p>
<p><strong>How do you kind of see the tools that we use for online gaming evolving within the art realm?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hans Ulrich Obrist: </strong><span>The question of authorship is changing. Videogames are a very interdisciplinary medium. I was thinking about what would be the Rite of Spring of the 21st century – and maybe it’s going to be a videogame. It’s only the beginning; there will be so much more in the future of video games. I think it’s important to think about games not only as games that can be mission-driven, but also games that address the problems of the 21st century. Maybe games can bring all the disciplines together, so we have games where all the artforms collaborate on one game. That idea of it being a collaborative practice brings a lot of potential.</span></p>]]>

<p><a href="/tag/dior"><span>Dior</span></a><span>’s resort show did not open with a gush of house music, but the rapping of steel-capped shoes outside the Plaza de España in Seville, where two stoney-faced flamenco dancers held court. As their taps began to swell into Rosalía’s </span><em><span>Di mi Nombre</span></em><span>, a phalanx of high-waisted matador pants, sombreros, Manila shawls, and equestrian uniforms made their way through the square’s arcades, which had been decked in thousands upon thousands of red carnations.

<p><span>There’s a certain thrill in dressing for a special occasion, whether it’s a white wedding dress, a graduation gown, or a first-day-of-work vintage suit. Garments like these play a significant role in modern life’s most transformative experiences. But what about the garments worn </span><em><span>after</span></em><span> life? Funeral wear (meaning, the outfit someone wears to their own burial, cremation, or another final service) may seem like a morbid branch of occasion wear. But these garments play a key role in the grieving process and like any product of fashion, they contain layers of material and symbolic meaning. </span></p>
<p><span>According to funeral director </span><a href="https://bijafscheid.nl/"><span>Susanne Duijvestein</span></a><span>, deceased today are dressed with comfort and individual expression in mind. “It feels natural to dress someone in their favourite clothes, like an outfit that made them feel comfortable when they were still alive.” She frequently spots deceased wearing hoodies, tracksuit pants, printed t-shirts and pieces like kimonos, which float between loungewear and ritual garments. To an objective onlooker, it might seem strange to dress the dead in something cosy. But it makes sense, counters </span><a href="http://www.piainterlandi.com/garments-for-the-grave/"><span>Dr Pia Interlandi</span></a><span>, a fashion and textiles academic and designer of funeral fashion. “We're trying to comfort them, and we're trying to comfort ourselves. It’s a symbolic gesture.” </span></p><p><span>Still, these comfortable t-shirts and tracksuits are still made for life, not death. Surely the two call for different dress codes? Up until recently, people wore a dedicated death outfit to their own funeral. Often taking the shape of a tunic or nightdress, these were sewn by women prior to their wedding and kept until needed. Some burial shrouds doubled as bridal nightwear or wedding dresses – like a uniform for someone’s most transformative moments. Although they are still common in an array of cultures and religions (the Islamic Kafan and Jewish Tachrichim come to mind), burial shrouds are no longer the norm in western funerals. Perhaps, like Y2K mini-bags and low-rise denim, it’s time to bring them back.</span></p>
<p><span>As a designer of bespoke funeral outfits, Dr Interlandi is already introducing the burial shroud into our modern time of self-expression and selfies. She reveals her inspiration came when dressing her grandfather for his funeral. “W</span><span>e put his shoes on and the material scientist in me, the part that understands materiality and durability, noted that these shoes were going to be around forever. But, he wasn’t going to be walking anywhere.” </span><span>With sustainability becoming an increasingly pressing issue on everyone’s mind, it seems only rational to dress the dead in biodegradable outfits. After all, they have no need for rubber-soled footwear or high-durability nylon tracksuit pants. </span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-vimeo" data-id="59317034"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/59317034?title=0amp;amp;byline=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>As a sustainable practitioner, Duijvestein urges families to dress their dead in natural fabrics. After analysing countless garments she’s </span><a href="http://www.piainterlandi.com/the-pig-project/"><span>recovered from graves</span></a><span> during her doctorate, Dr Interlandi crafts her biodegradable designs mostly from silk and wool. She explains that these are protein-based fibres, which is what the body is made out of as well. “Plant-based fibres, like cotton or linen, tend to go the quickest. Synthetics, including plastic buttons and most overlocking threads, will last hundreds of years.” But, as she also reflects: “Families aren’t that interested in thinking about their loved one’s body decomposing.” </span></p>
<p><span>The countless silk drawcords and intricate wrap-like silhouettes of her designs serve more than just an aesthetic purpose. Burial garments need to be easy to put on, either by a funeral director like Duijvestein or preferably by the families themselves. B</span><span>oth Dr Interlandi and Duijvestein recognise the therapeutic value in the </span><em><span>act</span></em><span> of dressing a deceased. Death can’t be controlled. But dressing the dead can. </span><span>“So, there has to be a point of ease of dressing, it has to be physically easy because emotionally it's already extremely heavy,” says Dr Interlandi. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>To some, dressing a dead loved one, a corpse, can seem </span><span>scary or even gruesome – to which Dr Interlandi shares a memory of dressing her grandfather in his shirt. “You have to weave your whole arm up the sleeve, hold their hand and pull it through. So by the time I’d pulled my grandfather’s arm out of the cuff, I was holding his hand. At that moment, I went from touching a dead body to holding my grandfather’s hand.” When it comes to burial garments, the act of dressing is perhaps more important than the piece itself. </span></p>
<p><span>As Dr Interlandi worked on her first commission, one by a spirited woman named Kaalii Cargill, the two were followed in an episode of ABC’s documentary series </span><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/tv/guide/abc1/201303/programs/AC1128V003D2013-03-26T220058.htm"><em><span>Anatomy</span></em></a><span>. Then in her 60s, Cargill wasn’t dying in the acute sense but came to Dr Interlandi after losing both her parents, making her acknowledge her own mortality. This wasn’t your off-the-rack shopping experience. As they met for the first time, Cargill mused: “It’s the process of bringing it into being that’s as important to me as the garment itself.” </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="13" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CMvlwnwsX-4/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
                </div>
<p><span>Together, they picked out fabrics and Cargill explained she wanted a light and unrestrictive feel. The result, a flowy silk tunic with a sunset-like gradient of burnt oranges and reds, Cargill hung in her living room like a ritualistic tapestry. She invited her family over. Reluctant at first, they discussed Cargill’s funeral with increasing intimacy, agreeing to dress her for it. “What’s kept in the pouch?” her daughter asked after a while, pointing at a golden-toned number dangling atop the tunic. “What you’d give me,” Cargill answered. Dr Interlandi was there for all of it, perhaps more of a ritual facilitator than a fashion designer. There in that living room, Cargill’s tunic was a proper conversation piece. </span> </p>
<p><span>In the initial shock accompanied by sympathy cards and bouquets that defines early grief, it’s logical to find solace in the ritual rather than the material. “The most human thing to do is to layer symbolic meaning onto things that are out of our control,” says Dr Interlandi. After all, burial garments are meant to decay or burn alongside the deceased, making them more fleeting than the fastest of fashion. It’s their connection to life, the act of selecting them, decorating them, dressing them and reliving the memories they hold, that gives them such a permanent meaning. So, Dr Interlandi’s designs are more of a communication tool than anything else. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="13" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CLpyGHEg3Wz/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
                </div>
<p><span>For the dying and their families, the Cargills included, addressing a burial outfit is a more accessible way to address death. It’s like the drawstrings on Dr Interlandi’s designs aren’t just there to connect the body to the garment, but to connect the living to death. Duijvestein, who hosts workshops on burial shroud creation, muses: “just like a funeral serves as a portrait of the deceased, a burial shroud can do so too.” She encourages her participants to use their shroud prior to death. “Let it be lived on, celebrated on, so it contains traces of life.” Fittingly, on that day in Cargill’s living room, her grandkids were armed with glitter and paint. Together, they transformed the silky white under-tunic that was part of Cargill’s death shroud, into a kaleidoscopic artwork. </span></p>
<p><span>When asked what they would wear to their own funeral, Duijvestein and Dr Interlandi gave surprisingly similar answers. Both mentioned a silk back-up outfit. Their respective outfits remain a work in progress. Duijvestein develops hers during her workshops, whereas Dr Interlandi has kept fabric scraps from clients’ garments to patchwork into a shroud of her own. And in that way, their respective outfits are as Duijvestein said: a portrait. </span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Fran#231;ois Ozon is still France’s most unpredictable filmmaker</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The arthouse icon talks to Nick Chen about death, working with Timothée Chalamet, and his darkly funny new film, Everything Went Fine</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1320/5/1325908.jpg" alt="Everything Went Fine 2#169;Carole BETHUEL_Mandarin_Pro" />
	</figure>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">France’s most unpredictable auteur has once again subverted expectations.<span> </span><em>Everything Went Fine</em>, the 21st film by François Ozon in 24 years, is a poignant drama about assisted dying that’s fast-paced, often laugh-out-loud funny, and, in its third act, a heist-thriller. Then again, that shouldn’t be surprising from Ozon, 54, a genre-shifting director who’s done an all-out musical (<em>8 Women</em>), a black-and-white period romance (<em>Frantz</em>), a gay fairy tale that defined the New French Extremity movement (<em>Criminal Lovers</em>), and a psychosexual horror that opens with a match-cut of a vagina and a tearful eyelid (<em>L’Amant double</em>).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“I wanted to make an action movie,” Ozon declares in the Sofitel Hotel, the week of the UK release. “Because the subject is euthanasia, everybody’s waiting for something very dark and about emotions. But, actually, it’s about organisation.” To bypass France’s laws against euthanasia, two daughters must smuggle their elderly father from a hospital bed in Paris to Switzerland. Is this Ozon’s version of<span> </span><em>Fast amp; Furious</em>? “It’s not like an American blockbuster! But the last 30 minutes have danger and the police. You want them to succeed, but at the same time, you don’t want him to die. These are the complex, opposite feelings I wanted to show.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ozon, as usual, penned the script, which he adapted from a 2013 memoir by Emmanuèle Bernheim, the late co-writer of Ozon’s<span> </span><em>Swimming Pool</em>,<span> </span><em>Ricky</em>,<span> </span><em>5x2</em>,<em><span> </span></em>and<span> </span><em>Under the Sand</em>. On-screen, Emmanuèle (Sophie Marceau) learns that her father, André (André Dussollier), has suffered a stroke and wishes to die. Moreover, the 85-year-old man wants Emmanuèle, not her sister, Pascale (Géraldine Pailhas), to organise the procedure. Several questions arise. Did André pick Emmanuèle as a punishment? Do they inform his estranged wife, Claude (Charlotte Rampling)? Given the legal obstacles, is euthanasia even an option? However, one question never posed by Emmanuèle, who’s heartbroken by the request, is whether André should reconsider his decision. It’s up to him, she insists.</p><p style="font-weight: 400;">The story seems so designed for Ozon, whose films like<span> </span><em>Sitcom</em><span> </span>and<span> </span><em>In the House<span> </span></em>satirise the nuclear family model, there’s even a surprise queer element – André has a secret boyfriend. “Some mean critics in France said I added the story of the father having a gay lover,” Ozon notes with a laugh. “But I didn’t invent it! That was real! I remember, one day, I told Emmanuèle I’d like to make a film about old, gay people, and she said, ‘I have so many stories to tell you about my father. It’s a nightmare.’”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Before Ozon and Bernheim could write about old, gay people or adapt<span> </span><em>Everything Went Fine</em><span> </span>together, Bernheim died in 2017, aged 61. Bernheim also cowrote Claire Denis’s<span> </span><em>Vendredi soir</em><span> </span>and is thanked in numerous Olivier Assayas features. “Some years after (when the film takes place), Emmanuèle had terminal cancer very fast,” Ozon says. “I think making this film was a way to understand why she had this cancer. I don’t know if there’s a link. But deep inside, I had this feeling she didn’t come out of it unhurt.” Did Bernheim ever mention who she’d want to be played by onscreen? “Her husband said to me she had Charlotte Gainsbourg in mind. But for me, it was Sophie Marceau... We grew up with her. She’s an actress of my generation. I wanted for a long time to work with her. This time she said yes because the story resonated with her own life.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="cadb_0xwt1Y"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cadb_0xwt1Y" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p style="font-weight: 400;">“She’s not like, for example, Isabelle Huppert, who wants to go into very dark things. Sophie needs to empathise with the character, and, after reading the book, she thought it was important to tell the story. She told me it was scandalous that the daughter couldn’t go with the father to Switzerland to spend the end of his life together.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rampling’s character, though, wasn’t mentioned in the memoir. Claude Bernheim was, in reality, a sculptor who worked with cement, and her art appears onscreen. “I asked the sister why the mother wasn’t in the book, and she said something shocking: the mother was already dead for her, because she was so sick, so depressed, so out of life. The father was sick, too, and wanted to die, but he was so full of life. But she was totally depressed and just gave up.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For the first two-thirds, the film follows Emmanuèle’s POV, including dream sequences shot sinisterly like snapshots from<span> </span><em>L’Amant double</em>. Then the narrative splits like an episode of<span> </span><em>24</em><span> </span>with parallel arcs. According to Ozon, he refined these rhythms in postproduction. “If you want the result to be exactly what you wanted at first, you have to take a lot of time, and you become mad like Stanley Kubrick. But I like the idea that the film doesn’t go in the direction you wanted it to go.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike Kubrick, Ozon is so prolific that he’s two films ahead of his UK release schedule. His 22nd film –<span> </span><em>Peter von Kant</em>, a gender-flipped remake of Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s<span> </span><em>The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant</em><span> </span>– premiered at Berlinale in February, and his 23rd,<span> </span><em>Madeleine</em>, just wrapped. “I spoke with Juliane Lorenz, Fassbinder’s last wife, and she confirmed to me that the story of<span> </span><em>Petra von Kant</em><span> </span>came from a love story with the actor Günther Kaufmann. So I adapted it this way.” Meanwhile,<span> </span><em>Madeleine</em><span> </span>will star Huppert and Dany Boon, who’s unknown in the UK but is the Adam Sandler of France. All Ozon will reveal is that it’s a “comedy”.</p><blockquote>
<p>“(Timothée Chalamet) has the schedule of American stars. It’s so complex. If you want to work with them, you have to organise yourself. Do they have time? I don’t know. Maybe it will happen” – François Ozon</p>
</blockquote><p style="font-weight: 400;">With Isabelle Adjani co-starring in<span> </span><em>Peter von Kant</em>, Ozon has seemingly worked with France’s biggest names: Huppert, Marceau, Rampling, Boon, Catherine Deneuve, and so on. In America, though, <a href="/tag/timothee-chalamet">Timothée Chalamet</a> has repeatedly named Ozon as his dream collaborator, and, in 2019, the pair were photographed together. “(Timothée Chalamet) speaks fluent French, which you don’t get often with American stars,” Ozon says. “But I think he has the schedule of American stars. It’s so complex. If you want to work with them, you have to organise yourself. Do they have time? I don’t know. Maybe it will happen.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As for what connects Ozon’s disparate films, he claims not to analyse his own work, and jokes that shooting<span> </span><a href="/film-tv/article/50830/1/summer-of-85-queer-coming-of-age-francois-ozon-interview" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/50830/1/summer-of-85-queer-coming-of-age-francois-ozon-interviewamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1655471344616000amp;usg=AOvVaw2UqY-mDOXhU5sLzf5dqfA4"><em>Summer of 85</em></a><em><span> </span></em>– a gay romance involving energetic teenage boys – was so physically demanding, he wanted the follow-up to involve an old man who lies in bed all the time. But<span> </span><em>Everything Went Fine</em>, he says, is an especially personal project, and is a tribute to Bernheim. “Many things were in the book. I just had to be faithful.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">He adds, “But her sister said to me, ‘I’m not sure Emmanuèle would have liked your portrait of (the father’s boyfriend) Gérard, because she hated him. And in the film, he’s nicer than in reality.’ But Emmanuèle was very warm. She would have been happy to see that the film is on the side of life and joy. Because the story is a paradox: it’s a man who loves life so much, and he wants to die. And I think Emmanuèle would have understood that. I hope so. We’ll never know.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Everything Went Fine <em>is out in UK cinemas and on <a href="https://homecinema.curzon.com/film/everything-went-fine/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://homecinema.curzon.com/film/everything-went-fine/amp;source=gmailamp;ust=1655471344616000amp;usg=AOvVaw0LGm14NI33_CrTGOVotNfF">Curzon Home Cinema</a> on June 17</em></p>]]>

<p><span>As <a href="/tag/perfume-genius">Perfume Genius</a>, Mike Hadreas has evolved from a contemplative singer-songwriter to an avant-garde visionary, pushing the boundaries of post-pop one delicate abstraction at a time. Originally created as a soundtrack for a modern dance performance with choreographer Kate Wallich in 2019, his sixth album, </span><em><span>Ugly Season</span></em><span>, the artist takes the focus away from his angelic voice, instead favouring loose and experimental song structures that swell operatically across swirling instrumental arrangements. These tracks oscillate in the space between binaries, mutating freely </span><span>across the album from delicate piano solos to grandiose organ solos, reggae pulses and a nine-minute psychedelic ambient epic.</span><span> The lyrics, too, are impressionist, often drifting into distorted sonics that seem worlds away from the direct confessionals that mark his earlier works. </span></p>
<p><span></span>Elsewhere, Machine Girl releases an epic game OST, Sound of Ceres <a href="/music/article/56296/1/marina-abramovic-sound-of-ceres-k-interview-space">team up</a> with <a href="/tag/marina-abramovic">Marina Abramović</a> on an interstellar album, and Yaya Bey’s record is a vivid contemplation of <span>heartache and joy.</span></p><h1>BÉBE YANA, SPACE MULAN</h1><h1>MACHINE GIRL, <em>NEON WHITE</em></h1><h1>PERFUME GENIUS,<em> UGLY SEASON</em></h1><h1>SOUND OF CERES, <em>EMERALD SEA</em></h1><h1>YAYA BEY, <em>REMEMBER YOUR NORTH STAR</em></h1>]]>

<p><span>When <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bornalongaroad/">Ode</a> saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmK_GNvCmjE">Marcinha do Corintho</a> for the first time </span><span>on TV at age 11 while packing up to go to school the next morning, she was instantly mesmerised by the vision on screen. A legendary Brazilian travesti (a transgender identity existing within Latin American culture), do Corintho had risen to fame in the 80s and 90s, and was considered an icon of trans beauty at the annual carnival in Brazil. </span></p>
<p><span>That evening, she was performing on the widely popular variety show </span><em><span>Programa Silvio Santos</span></em><span>, which was one of the first shows in the country to put LGBTQIA+ people on television without pejorative connotations. “</span><span>Marcinha was the only travesti among many drag queens in the lip-sync battle and, aesthetically, her performance was the most impeccable thing I had ever seen,” remembers Ode.</span></p><p><span>Years after that first encounter with do Corintho, </span><span>Ode, now a stylist and artist living in São Paulo, became engrossed with the performer’s persona while also beginning to understand her own identity. ‘I was </span><span>starting to feel dysphoric and gradually realising that I was also a travesti at the time,” explains the artist. “Diving into my childhood memories that would later become a recurring subject in my work, I spent days watching all of the videos I could find of Marcinha on YouTube. I became obsessed with her.”</span></p>
<p><span>That fascination led Ode to create a tribute to Marcinha in her new film </span><em><span>Divina</span></em><span>. </span><span>The short offers an intimate glimpse into do Corintho’s world, as she talks openly about starting her transition at age 14, having to stop her education because of being bullied by fellow students, and the joy of meeting another travesti, Patricia Costa, for the first time. She also proudly discusses her many victories and career highlights, including her move to Spain when she was just 16, where she was caught in a whirlwind of success as she began staging shows both in Europe and back in Brazil. </span></p><p><span>This colourful history is reflected in the space do Corintho now calls home. The film follows her through her house, where drawings and photographs of the artist are propped against walls, alongside newspaper and magazine clippings, pageant banners, innumerable trophies, costume sketches, and dolls made in her likeness that wear mini versions of her most recognisable looks. </span></p>
<p><span>Across </span><em><span>Divina</span></em><span>’s three chapters – which </span><span>allude to the bible verse John 14:6</span><span>, </span><em><span>The Way</span></em><span>, </span><em><span>The Truth </span></em><span>and </span><em><span>The Life</span></em><span> – Ode presents do Corintho in a way that stands against the usual rhetorics associated with the travesti identity. “I covered Marcinha in iconographies of saints that I saw around my hometown as a way to bring up the issue of how it’s common to see images of travestis and trans women in the news being beaten up, killed, and demonised,” she says. “I wanted to explore a different narrative: to show that travestis can be alive, grow old, leave a legacy, be victorious, and be seen as sacred.”</span></p><p><span>Through the saint-like depiction of do Corintho and a showcase of many artefacts from her life, as well as other sacral references such as a soundtrack inspired by Christian choirs and Afro-Brazilian religions, Ode makes a powerful statement about the value of trans lives. Do Corintho, representing all of her travesti family, is portrayed as a deity that is meant to be worshipped. “In the context of Brazil – the country in which the most trans people are being killed year after year – the possibility of having an eternal life, besides being a dream of mine, is the message that I want </span><em><span>Divina</span></em><span> to convey. I think that the possibility to dream fertilises life and avenges death.” </span></p>

<p><span>The Vauxhall railway arch that once housed the legendary gay sauna Chariots was the perfect location for </span><a href="/tag/martine-rose"><span>Martine Rose</span></a><span> to present her new</span><a href="/fashion/article/56305/1/london-fashion-week-men-ss23-ahluwalia-martine-rose-gay-spa-robyn-lynch-africa"><span> SS23 show</span></a><span>. Bubbling with sexual tension, the collection captured the spirit of awkward, lust-fuelled encounters, with clothing that looked like it had been put on in a hurry – think wonky shirt collars, wrinkled crotches and skew-whiff seams. Slinky satin minis and oversized leopard-print shirts enhanced the sensual atmosphere, as did the necklaces strung with keyrings depicting erogenous zones.</span></p>
<p><span>The beauty looks were also a bit lived in and messed up, courtesy of hairstylist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/garygillhair/">Gary Gill</a> and make-up artist <a href="http://www.instagram.com/marinabelfonrose/">Marina Belfon-Rose</a>. Striking eyeliner looks were smudged and imperfect, giving the impression of having been hastily thrown on or actively sweated off. Brows were drawn on pencil-thin and hair was mussed and grown out.  </span></p>
<p><span>For the beauty, the two longtime Martine Rose collaborators took inspiration from a deconstructed punk aesthetic, tailoring each look to the individual model and the character they were portraying. “The beauty look in terms of the hair was very character-driven which is always such a great thing about Martine’s show,” Gill says. The hair, he says, had a late 70s punk feel with a hint of what was to come in the 80s. “Granny punk, the beginnings of the mullet, mixed with natural textures, raw bleach and grown out DIY colour, provided by Bleach London.” </span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>When it came to the make-up, Belfon-Rose wanted it to look almost as if the models had done it themselves. “The make-up inspiration was very much focused on deconstructed punk from the late 70s,” she says, “appearing to feel somewhat self-applied and lived in.” A variation of different eyeliners, bleaching and recreating brow shapes could be found, all tailored to each individual. </span></p>
<p><span>The looks were created using Kat Von D make-up, while a natural-looking skin was achieved with CeraVe skincare. “It was important to keep the skin looking as natural as possible, using minimal skin make-up,” says Belfon-Rose. “So skin prep was our main focus for this.”</span></p>]]>

<p><span>In 2007, one of the most extraordinary photographic discoveries of the 20th century was made in an anonymous storage locker in Chicago. This archive of images would not only offer a window into the world of this hitherto unknown artist, but also provide glimpses of poignant moments in the lives of thousands of anonymous individuals immortalised by this unseen and unacknowledged woman moving among them.</span></p>
<p><span>This lone photographer was Vivian Maier. By that time, Maier was elderly and impoverished, having spent her life in obscurity working as a nanny for families in Chicago and New York. After the rent for her storage facility had fallen into arrears, everything inside was summarily seized and sold off at auction. The young real estate agent who happened to buy a box of her belongings began to sift through the contents and discovered the wondrous beauty of the never-before-seen images he found inside. In this improbable and precarious way, her life’s work came to light just two years before her death. </span></p><p><span>A new exhibition, </span><a href="https://mkgallery.org/event/vivian-maier/"><em><span>Vivian Maier: Anthology</span></em></a><span> (at Milton Keynes’ </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mk_gallery/"><span>MK Gallery)</span></a><span> presents Maier’s work in the UK for the first time. The show includes over 140 photographs – predominantly black and white but also her later experiments in colour as well as never-before-displayed Super 8 films. </span></p>
<p><span>Maier was continually on the periphery. As a nanny, she was part of the household but forever on the outside, once described as a “real-life Mary Poppins” – an apt observation for a magical but transitory presence who enters a home without being a member of the family.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>Her</span><span> life as a nanny also aligned with her habitual photography. She was known to take the children in her care on all manner of interesting and unusual day trips around the city as part of not only her pursuit of pictures but her innate and childlike curiosity. </span><span>The exhibition dedicates a whole section to her portraits of children. Her affinity for kids and their vision of the world around them is evident throughout her work and the subjects she’s recurringly drawn to –  details of the world around us that, as adults, we‘re often desensitised to while children are still receptive to. And her love of children was reciprocated by the kids she cared for during her 40-year-long career. She evidently became significant to the three Gensburg boys she looked after from 1956 until 1967. In her retirement, they bought an apartment for her and, later, paid for the care home she lived out her final years.</span></p>
<p><span>Rolleiflex in hand, Maier engaged with the world from her uniquely liminal perspective. Taking pictures of the street life of New York and Chicago, her images form an intricate narrative about American life with an ensemble cast of thousands. In her double life as a street photographer, she amassed more than 150,000 images alongside Super 8 and 16mm films, prints, audio tapes, and reems of undeveloped film… pristine uptown children in t-bar sandals holding their mothers’ gloved hands, urban cowboys, lovers, pavement detritus, lipsticked women wrapped in fur stoles, juvenile delinquents, the homeless, old ladies colluding as they cross the street. “Vivian’s images offer a unique view of genius in action,” Wisdom continues. “Each shot seems to have been watermarked with an unmistakable charm.” </span></p>
<p><span>“Vivian Maier’s story is an extraordinary one,” writes the gallery’s director, Anthony Spira. “The nanny who lived secretly as a world-class photographer whose remarkable work remained virtually unknown in her lifetime is now hailed as one of the greatest recorders of American life in the 20th century, cementing her place in the history of photography alongside Helen Levitt, Diane Arbus, and Robert Frank.”</span></p>
<p><span>Each photograph is totally absorbing, a vignette of humankind captured with her empathetic eye “Vivian had a gift for entering the privacy of the people she photographed,” writes photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lindawisdomphotography/">Linda Wisdom</a> in the exhibition’s accompanying text. “Her brilliance in reading human behaviour is undeniable. Like a movie trailer, her photographs leave us with more questions than answers.”</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">How young, religious LGBTQ+ people are reconciling their identities</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">There’s no ‘right way’ to be a queer person of faith</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/608/azure/dazed-prod/1320/5/1325819.jpg" alt="Alexander Balakrishnan" />		<figcaption>

<p><span>Coming out as LGBTQ+ can be difficult for many religious people. In fact, </span><a href="https://www.stonewall.org.uk/resources-lgbt-people-faith"><span>Stonewall research</span></a><span> shows that a </span><span>third of lesbian, gay and bi people of faith aren’t open with anyone in their faith community about their sexual orientation. This figure rises to one in four among trans people.</span></p>
<p><span>This is often rooted in the false belief that a religious and LGBTQ+ identities are mutually exclusive. W</span><span>ith religion often historically being used as a means of persecuting queer people, perhaps the LGBTQ+ community’s wariness of faith is not ill-founded. But many religious groups <em>have</em> shown progress in their attitudes towards queerness: for example, </span><a href="http://www.brin.ac.uk/figures/attitudes-towards-gay-rights/"><span>one study found</span></a><span> that the path towards acceptance among various Christian groups in the UK has largely mirrored that of non-religious people between 1983-2013. </span></p><p><span>Exposed to homophobia as a teenager, Amardeep, 27, struggled to reconcile their beliefs as a Sikh with their queer identity. They point to the double standards within the Sikh community and the argument against allowing queer people to marry within the gurdwara, the Sikh place of worship. “Often people say no, because they say queer people have a ‘deviant lifestyle’, or that sex is only for the purpose of procreation,” they explain. “But a lot of the heterosexual people who [can] get married in the gurdwara will drink, they will have had casual sex, they will have [recreational] sex in their marriage.”</span></p>
<p><span>As Amardeep grew up, they learnt that an open-minded, less orthodox approach to faith helped them find greater empowerment in their identity as a whole. With queerness still largely taboo, they decided to take advantage of their “non-respectable” status in their interpretation of scripture.</span></p>
<p><span>Hein, 24, a Burmese Buddhist, also grappled with homophobia in religious settings in his youth. Notably, he faced hurtful accusations that he had accrued bad karma in his past lives leading to him being reincarnated as a a gay man. Despite the trauma from his experiences, Hein recently decided to reconnect with his faith since moving to London and finding more openness from religious authorities.</span></p>
<p><span>He says that opening up about his sexuality in a religious setting was freeing. “I decided to go to a monastery and be open about my sexuality to the monks,” he says. While there, to his surprise, he found a connection with one of the monks. “He’s a Burmese Buddhist, and it’s been going well. He completely accepted [my identity]. He didn’t say anything about bad karma or that it’s a negative thing.”</span></p>
<p><span>Hein stresses that reconnecting with religion is still an ongoing process. “For me, it’s still hard to approach temples and monasteries because I hate, hate, </span><em><span>hate</span></em><span> having to explain my sexuality to a monk. But in a temple, all you have to do to take part is pray to Buddha and that’s it.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“The relationship between my faith and I is very personal and no one has the power to take that away from me” – Furgie</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Furgie, 29, is a non-binary Muslim, and like Hein, they believe that embracing faith on your own terms can be freeing. When they faced faith-based homophobia, they found themselves fielding accusations that they didn’t belong in the Muslim community, should stop labelling themselves as Muslim and repent. “It made me want to investigate what is the truth for myself, and what I learned really helped me get closer to my faith,” they say. “The relationship between my faith and I is very personal and no one has the power to take that away from me.”</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike Furgie, Meriem, 23, still identifies as a relatively orthodox Muslim. She recently came out as bisexual to her religious community, and has been touched by their efforts to understand and accept her identity.</span></p>
<p><span>“Everything is so black and white in our world right now [...] but being Irish and Egyptian, there were always two contrasting opinions in my house at all times,” she says. “I think it’s a really big step for someone who’s been so wired to believe that [being queer] is the biggest sin that you can commit to be on this path of learning. I think these are all really good steps in the right direction, and not all of us start from the same starting point. So for me, personally, it was massive, and I was really grateful to see those changes, even if, to someone else, those changes are really minor.”</span></p>
<p><span>However, Furgie disagrees and insists that acceptance isn’t enough. “Some of my religious friends tolerate my identity, but they don’t accept it. They use the justification that they are taught from religion not to judge, but to me, </span><em><span>tolerating</span></em><span> someone and </span><em><span>accepting</span></em><span> someone are two very different things,” they say. “I definitely feel a lot of religious folks aren’t allies. They tolerate our existence as LGBTQIA+ folks, but they wouldn’t fight hand in hand with us for our rights and our humanity.”</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>Others also find it hard to be so open about their sexuality. Merab, 23, a Pakistani Christian, has chosen to not tell her religious community about her bisexuality yet due to the threat of homophobia. Deciding to identify openly as religious and LGBTQ+ can be difficult: “historically, Christianity has excluded the LGBTQ+ community,” Merab says, and there are myriad connections between religion and anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span>However, that’s not to say that these identities can’t co-exist. “The Church has evolved as an institution and I want those who are LGBTQ+ to know that they are welcome in the Church and that Christianity is a faith that loves and accepts everybody,” Merab adds. “This hasn’t changed my own view of my faith. I believe that my religion does not allow for homophobia because Jesus loves everyone and we were all made in His image.”</span></p>
<p><span>To all of these young people, faith is a highly personal experience. There’s evidently no ‘right’ way to be queer and religious. But faced with accusations from both within their religious communities and the wider LGBTQ+ community that religion and queerness are mutually exclusive, they all stress the importance of cultivating links with their religious roots, in spite of – and sometimes even because of – the homophobia which often runs deep in their communities.</span></p>
<p><span>To Amardeep, the decision to remain religious is even more than just one of faith; as difficult as the journey may be, remaining openly, confidently Sikh is an act of defiance. “Criticism of religious LGBTQ+ people doesn’t recognise the fact that actually, for a lot of us who engage with our faith, it’s not just the spiritual path that we’re engaged on. It’s actually a political path as well,” they say. “Carving space within the spiritual community, for people who have traditionally been outcast, or shamed, or born the brunt of violence, is as much a political action as it is a spiritual action.”</span></p>
<p><span>“Remaining and clinging to those communities, refusing to let them go, having those awful, horrendous conversations, doing that work and being visible within them – that’s what we can do for young queer kids that are growing up in our own communities,” they continue. “And that’s really important politically – even if you think God is bullshit.”</span></p>]]>

<p><span>It’s often easier to trace the changing tides of trend on fashion week attendees as opposed to the shows themselves, as they mix subcultural staples and their own thrifted finds with designer must-haves. And this season, clear themes began to emerge. There were boys in skirts; tons of </span><a href="/fashion/article/56147/1/dior-erl-collaboration-collection-cruise-kim-jones-yayoi-kusama-pride-cannes"><span>ERL</span></a><span>-style gradient knitwear; tennis skirts and blinged-out caps; bandanas; and loads of clothes that looked as though they had been stamped with arts and crafts potatoes à la </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mashapopovap/?hl=en"><span>Masha Popova</span></a><span>. </span></p><p><span>It all gestured towards this freaky, no-rules approach to dress which asks people to dig a little deeper and exercise their own taste alongside an allegiance to trend. Naturally, Dazed’s roving photographer <a href="/tag/yu-fujiwara">Yu Fujiwara</a> was there to capture it all.

<h1 class="fl-title">How to have an engaging social media presence </h1>

<p><span>For the third instalment of our</span><em><span> Making It Up As You Go Along</span></em><span> series of educational talks on how to break into the creative industries, we sat down with the team behind Dazed’s six million-strong social media platforms to learn how they engage with you lot on a daily basis. From planning for cultural moments, to curating memes – content editor Vanessa Hsieh, senior social media editor Marios Mystidis, and social media coordinator Chester McKee lift the lid on translating the magazine for the extremely online. Here are five takeaways from the night. </span></p><h2><strong>ALWAYS THINK ABOUT HOW YOU USE IT YOURSELF </strong></h2>
<p><span>“I think the key thing to remember whether you’re doing social media for yourself or a brand, is to always think about how you use it yourself,” says Vanessa. “We consume so much all the time, we become hyper-aware of how it’s utilised so I am always more interested and engaged when I can see how a brand or account is playing with our expectations within the limits set by these platforms.” Emphasising the need for it to feel personal and organic at its core, Dazed’s social tone of voice has been cultivated over the past five years to break away from rigid posting in triptychs and appeal directly to the audience, positioning content from print and digital as you would sharing with friends. “Using an internet-native language of memes, pop culture commentary and more to speak straight to the end-user, we’re able to establish a tone of voice so it’s recognisable even when people aren’t familiar with the magazine, as the nature of social often presents posts out of context to new audiences.” It’s a fine line to balance between being personal while also operating as a publisher, but thankfully the social team at Dazed are all around the ages of our target demographic so sense-checking is easy. “Obviously always think within the parameters of the brand you’re representing, and if your gut instinct feels off, use the people around you to consult and collaborate.”</span></p><h2><strong>VARY YOUR CONTENT </strong></h2>
<p><span>No one wants to see the same thing over and over again. While regular programming helps build consistency across platforms, making sure the content itself feels fresh, different and original every time is the key to getting more engagement across your posts. At Dazed, we have a 360 approach to producing content, always thinking about how formats can be “stackable” across the board – and we collect content with this in mind. “As platforms have shifted towards video-first we have been conscious with how we translate the storytelling from print and online into social-first video,” says Marios. “We’re involved in the process from the start so these asks can be put to talent teams in good time.”</span></p><h2><strong>TAILOR CONTENT TO SPECIFIC PLATFORMS </strong></h2>
<p><span>Always remember the same thing won’t work across all platforms. “Positioning is so important,” says Marios of our process of creating content with end platforms in mind. “Something that works for Instagram or Pinterest might not work for TikTok which is more chaotic and has a shorter attention span.” With audiences increasingly consuming direct on the platform, content needs to be optimised for where it’s being seen and it helps to keep up to date with each latest feature to see how we can capitalise on organic pushes from within the platform. “It helps to think of each platform as a site in and of itself, and approach commissioning native social content in the same way the other teams do,” says Vanessa. </span></p><h2><strong>PLAN AHEAD </strong></h2>
<p><span>The easiest way to get engagement is to capitalise on conversations that are already happening. While there’s no magic 8 ball for whatever “discourse” the internet is going to latch onto next, you can plan ahead for big cultural moments that people will be talking about – and the work of social media coordinator Chester is crucial to the team knowing when these moments are. “For example, at the moment it’s Pride so we can reposition our extensive archive of evergreen LGBTQ stories, and plan videos like our </span><em><span>What is Pride?</span></em><span> series looking at the LGBTQ experience from New York to Sierra Leone.” What’s evergreen, you ask? “It’s basically content that doesn’t rely on a specific news hook to be relevant, like beautiful photo stories, that we can reposition on social as and when we need.” Where possible we always like to create new original content, so the cultural calendar allows us to have the necessary lead time to action bigger content pieces and campaign moments.</span></p><h2><strong>HAVE FUN WITH IT </strong></h2>
<p><span>At the end of the day, it’s social media not surgery – so lighten up! As much as the pandemic proved how platforms can be used for real cultural change, it’s easy to get caught up in this extremely online world. If something doesn’t work, it’s not the end of the world. “As an emerging space, social media is a great place to experiment and see what sticks,” says Vanessa. “It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers of it all but there are stories worth telling beyond our endlessly scrolling screens. As important as it is to stay plugged in, there are times it’s good to get outside and touch the grass, shift your perspective and return refreshed.”</span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Dazed Mix: Crystallmess</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The Paris-based DJ shares an eerie mixtape featuring 100 BPM electro, New Orleans bounce, Congolese and Ugandan rap, and more</h3>

<p><span>Whether she’s behind the decks at Berghain or throwing together cutting-edge club edits at <a href="/tag/yves-tumor">Yves Tumor</a>’s Terms of Endearment party, Crystallmess (real name Christelle Oyiri) knows how to pull in an audience. The Paris-based artist is recognised for her genre-fluid approach to DJing, switching effortlessly between pummeling techno cuts, high-speed electro and melodic trance. Her club-adjacent tracks are equally varied; mutant techno-IDM bangers that draw on moody and experimental textures to form a cohesive narrative.</span></p>
<p><span>As a multidisciplinary artist, Oyiri also sheds light on past and present subcultures through performances and mixed media work that tackles themes of club culture, colonial alienation and alternative temporalities. Her latest exhibition at Glasgow’s Tramway explores The Ivory Coast’s 2002 military coup, while a 2018 project <em>Collective Amnesia</em> hones in on the forgotten history of </span><a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/41046/1/logobi-ivory-coast-france-paris-dance"><span>logobi</span></a><span>, an urban Afro-French dance from the mid-00s.</span></p><p><span>For her Dazed mix, Oyiri shares an eerie mixtape that spans 100 BPM electro, New Orleans bounce, Congolese and Ugandan rap. “The first part of the mix is slow and sensual until we reach a new rhythm portal and unleash the 140 BPM bangers,” she says.</span></p><div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-soundcloudtrack" data-id="1288048561%3Fsecret_token=s-8A5OD4S1ZYg"><iframe class="soundcloud-embed" frameborder="0" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com/tracks/1288048561%3Fsecret_token=s-8A5OD4S1ZYgamp;amp;show_artwork=true" width="100%"></iframe></div><p><strong>How is your summer going? Any plans?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crystallmess:</strong><span> My summer is more than ever a moment of realisation and epiphanies. I plan on touring in July again and will try to sit still for the month of August in the countryside in France.</span></p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your artistic practice? How, if at all, does it relate to your music?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crystallmess: </strong><span>My artistic practice is vicariously related to my music, music is often my point of entry to iconography or even theory. </span></p>
<p><strong>What are some of your earliest memories of music? Have they influenced your sound at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crystallmess:</strong><span> My earliest memories of music are Jamiroquai, my big brothers YO MTV! Raps VHS tapes – they would play “Can it be so simple“ by Wu-Tang Clan over and over again. A staple of beauty, haunting, gloomy and melancholic, it never left me. </span></p>
<p><strong>What’s your experience of the pandemic been like? Did you spend it focusing on music?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crystallmess: </strong><span>My experience of the pandemic was dark on one hand, and a renaissance on the other hand. My parents work as caretakers in the health sector so they were constantly exposed and were never rewarded in any capacity for putting themselves on the line and doing their job despite the fear. Friends and family members lost loved ones they couldn’t bury with the honour and decorum they deserve, some said bye to their loved ones on the phone. </span></p>
<p><span>I had to sit with these feelings like the majority of the world, we faced collective mourning. I spent the pandemic focusing on building meaningful relationships, taking care of myself, recording some music mostly for others, scoring mainly and exploring a new dimension of my artistry. </span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

Under his better-known alias, Cardopusher, Garban has previously worked – alongside the likes of </span><a href="/tag/rosalia"><span>Rosalía</span></a><span> and </span><a href="/tag/boys-noize"><span>Boys Noize</span></a><span> – on several tracks from Arca’s </span><a href="/music/article/54968/1/new-music-friday-7-albums-to-stream-this-week-arca"><em><span>KiCk</span></em></a><span> series, including </span><span>“</span><a href="/music/article/49591/1/arca-and-rosalia-team-up-for-new-song-klk"><span>KLK</span></a><span>” and the Sia collab “</span><a href="/music/article/54390/1/arca-and-sia-collaborate-on-emotional-cut-born-yesterday-kick-ii"><span>Born Yesterday</span></a><span>”.</span></p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, the new track marks a different direction for Garban, who has experimented with “mutating a rowdy, old school reggaeton sound” inspired by his upbringing in 90s Caracas for the Safety Trance alias.</span></p><p><span>“My idea with this record was simply to explore the capabilities of reggaeton and take it to new territories,” he says, of </span><em><span>Noches de Terror</span></em><span>. “Many people think that this genre is just what you hear on the radio when it’s definitely not.”</span></p>
<p><span>Arca contributes vocals to </span><span>“El Alma Que Te Trajo”, over a hard-hitting beat and atmospheric synths. She also stars in the accompanying video, which she directed alongside visual artist </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/wicboyx/?hl=en"><span>Unax LaFuente</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Safety Trance’s full </span><em><span>Noches de Terror </span></em><span>EP is set to be released on July 14, via Boysnoize Records. Watch the video for </span><span>“El Alma Que Te Trajo” above.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>It was the chaos of the world right now, the urgent need to express ourselves, and classical Geisha beauty that inspired the make-up </span><a href="/beauty/head/article/46721/1/joey-choy-val-garland-make-up-artist-interview"><span>Joey Choy</span></a><span> created for her latest photo story. “Traditional Geishas painted their faces white to enhance their features under candlelight and to disguise their true emotions,” says Choy, who teamed up with photographer </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/terrencejb/"><span>Terry Broadbent</span></a><span> and hairstylist </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yoko_setoyama/"><span>Yoko Setoyama</span></a><span> for the project. “The inspiration behind the shoot was to distort traditions, rebel against the norm, mask and unmask.”</span></p>
<p><span>Taking Geisha hair, make-up and lighting as their reference and, as Choy says, their “anti-reference”, the team kept some elements classic while at the same time flipping other aspects to be the opposite of what they should be. “It was all about putting it together and then scrambling part of it.” </span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>Keeping the powdery white base consistent throughout the images, Choy then abandoned the traditional shades of red and black for bright yellows and greens, purples and blues. She then layered metallics and gloss on top to contrast the traditional soft matte texture and bring light into the looks. </span></p>
<p><span>When it came to the hair, Choy says Setoyama deconstructed the Geisha hairstyles into various sculptural shapes. “Hair was focused on creating simple but strong details on the face line, framing the face with some graphic sculpted shape to add extra impact to the make-up.”</span></p>	<figure>

<h1 class="fl-title">Lil Wayne banned from UK ahead of his headlining festival show</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The rapper’s appearance at Cambridge’s Strawberries  Creem would have been his first UK show in 14 years, but the Home Office has other ideas</h3>

<p><span><a href="/lil-wayne">Lil Wayne</a> has been pulled as the headliner for this weekend’s Strawberries amp; Creem Festival in Cambridge, after being denied entry into the country by the Home Office. Billed as the UK comeback of the Grammy-winning rapper (real name </span><span>Dwayne Michael Carter Jr.), the festival slot would have marked his first performance in the UK for 14 years.</span></p>
<p><span>Carter’s visa application was refused by the Home Office in a “last-minute decision”, according to a statement from the festival organisers. “We have received very minimal notice, and the timing of the decision is of course upsetting for all involved – including Lil Wayne’s fans, as well as the festival team.”</span></p><p><span>As reported by the </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-61816265"><span>BBC</span></a><span>, the Home Office doesn’t routinely comment on individual cases, but said: “</span><span>Any individual who has been sentenced to a custodial sentence of 12 months or more must have their application refused.”</span></p>
<p><span>In 2010, Carter was sentenced to a year in prison after pleading guilty to gun possession, following his arrest in 2007, when a gun was found on his tour bus. He also faced up to ten years in prison for a </span><span>federal weapons charge in 2020, but </span><a href="/politics/article/51701/1/donald-trump-pardons-lil-wayne-and-kodak-black-but-dips-out-on-joe-exotic"><span>was pardoned</span></a><span> by Donald Trump in the final hours of the former president’s administration.</span></p>
<p><span>Since the last-minute decision was announced, many Lil Wayne fans have taken to social media to express their outrage, and to call out Strawberries amp; Creem for its handling of the issue.</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">

<p><span>Reportedly, the festival isn’t offering fans refunds, despite the fact that some forked out more than £200 just to see him perform for the first time in over a decade. Instead, organisers have offered free tickets for the second day of the festival, on June 19, or a discount on next year’s tickets. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="/ludacris">Ludacris</a> is set to replace Lil Wayne as the Saturday headliner, playing a “UK exclusive” set.</span></p>
<p><span>Of course, this isn’t the first time that the Home Office has blocked a leading hip hop artist from performing in the UK. Back in 2015, the government </span><a href="/music/article/26100/1/tyler-the-creator-banned-from-uk-over-lyrics"><span>infamously banned</span></a> <span><a href="/tyler-the-creator">Tyler, the Creator</a> as well – more bizarrely, in Tyler’s case, he was denied entry due to lyrics on the years-old albums </span><em><span>Bastard</span></em><span> and </span><em><span>Goblin</span></em><span>. If anything, though, that only stoked the excitement of UK-based Tyler, the Creator fans, leading to </span><a href="/music/article/44551/1/the-tyler-the-creator-peckham-south-london-gig-that-never-was"><span>chaotic scenes</span></a><span> when he finally returned in 2019.</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">Ken has always been gay</h1>

	</figure>
<p><span>Yesterday, Greta Gerwig’s upcoming </span><a href="/film-tv/article/53498/1/greta-gerwig-is-directing-the-barbie-movie-starring-margot-robbie"><em><span>Barbie</span></em></a><span> film set the internet ablaze by releasing the first promotional still of Ken, played by Ryan Gosling. With his peroxide blonde hair, orange spray tan and washboard abs, he looks like some <a href="/life-culture/article/55458/1/in-defence-of-ageing-twinks-james-greig#:~:text=The%20ageing%20twink%20who%20rejects,viewed%20as%20a%20tragic%20condition.">ageing twink</a> that you’d see at G-A-Y Late on a Wednesday night – and reactions haves been mixed. Lots of people said that, at 42, Gosling is simply too old to play Ken, while others lambasted this as ageist; writing in </span><em><span>The Independent</span></em><span>, Victoria Richards </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/ryan-gosling-ken-doll-barbie-movie-age-41-b2101972.html"><span>argued</span></a><span>, “</span><span>It’s time to do away with ageism and recognise that you don’t have to be below 25 to be beautiful.”</span></p>
<p><span>Already, the image has inspired scores of memes based on the simple premise that Ken looks, well, </span><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/ryan-gosling-as-ken-funny-twitter-reactions"><span>kind of gay</span></a><span>. This is nothing new. The doll has a long history as a gay symbol, which stands to reason: minus a handle-bar moustache, he embodies the kind of beauty ideals that in the 70s and 80s would find you atop the sexual hierarchy of Fire Island. He is also, of course, extremely kitsch – a vibe which has always been popular among gay men.</span><span></span></p><p><span>The most striking example of Ken as an accidental gay icon is ‘</span><a href="https://www.intheknow.com/post/earring-magic-ken-gay/?guccounter=1amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAzCfzAhDm6uODU-4nZwtF2otpLZUAJNMRtpBtWd_m-f52xKDHDpcISWcI6AvuUdd8Iah5GXxvAplgKnxSixIOk9KX5249WAIX8-xgayQAZ2EfgPZSLXLxfVxFMQJjPktXZkk1JIqCeokAF8EkYVqBrXOXxaL0laXpgfjEqnc6Nx"><span>Earring Magic Ken</span></a><span>’, a doll which was released in 1993. Mattel had been manufacturing Barbie since 1959, and while she had always sold well, Ken – introduced a little while later – was something of a flop. In an effort to boost sales in the early 90s, Mattel ran a focus group with a bunch of five-year-old girls to figure out how they could make the doll more appealing. These girls, inspired by music videos on MTV and the aesthetics of Prince, Right Said Fred, and Madonna’s backing dancers, said they wanted Ken to have a mesh shirt, leather vest, earrings, tight pants and a necklace. The resulting product,  Earring Magic Ken, went down in history as one of the most disastrous marketing decisions of all time. The doll proved controversial partly just because it was clearly a little bit fruity, but also because the necklace Ken wore looked a lot like a chrome cock ring – a sex toy which at the time was commonly used as a fashion accessory within the US’s queer nightlife scene.</span></p>
<p><span>Writer Dan Savage </span><a href="https://chicagoreader.com/news-politics/ken-comes-out/"><span>wrote an article</span></a><span> about the doll in </span><em><span>The Chicago Reader</span></em><span>, arguing that the necklace is “</span><span>what ten out of ten people in-the-know will tell you at a glance is a cock ring”, and suggesting that Mattel’s design team had “spent a weekend in LA or New York dashing from rave to rave, taking notes and Polaroids”. In response to the ensuing backlash, Mattel’s head of communications disavowed any deliberate attempt to imitate gay culture and publicly stated that “we’re not in the business of putting cock rings into the hands of little girls”. </span><span>Nowadays, Mattell would probably double down and describe Earring Magic Ken as ‘defiantly, unapologetically queer’, but this was a much more homophobic time, in the midst of the AIDS crisis and well before the rise of corporate LGBT marketing. Instead, Mattel hastily discontinued and recalled the product – despite the fact that, commercially speaking, it was a roaring success. Hoards of gay men rushed out to buy it ironically, making it to this day the best-selling Ken doll of all time.</span></p>	<figure>

Earring Magic Ken			<span class="fl-credit"></span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>The whole debacle is a lesson in how corporations are willing to appropriate the cultural capital of marginalised subcultures, but only when it’s safe and uncontroversial to do so. Mattell wanted a doll that was ‘cool’ and in keeping with the zeitgeist of the time… just not in a gay way. But 30 years on, the fact that Ryan Gosling’s interpretation of the character looks so similar represents the ultimate vindication of Magic Earring Ken.</span></p>
<p><span>Around the same time, Ken was re-imagined as an altogether different sort of gay icon in </span><a href="https://www.hivplusmag.com/features/2013/07/09/diseased-pariah-news-married-rage-and-hilarity"><em><span>Diseased Pariah News</span></em></a><span>, a satirical zine created by people living with AIDS which launched in 1990 – years before the introduction of effective treatment, this was a time when contracting HIV was still a more-or-less gauranteed death sentence. As its name suggests, </span><em><span>Diseased Pariah News</span></em><span> was defined by the darkest and most irreverent kind of black comedy, one which didn’t shy away from the grim realities of living with HIV and, in many cases, dying of AIDS-related illnesses. Defiantly cynical and pessimistic, it dealt in the kind of humor that makes you feel a little bit guilty for laughing at. One of their recurring gags was running fake adverts for ‘AIDS Barbie’ and ‘KS Ken’ (referring to Kaposi Sarcoma, a disease related to AIDS which caused visible skin lesions)’; the series featured  ‘AIDS Barbie’s New Malibu Dream Hospice’ and posters showing Ken hooked up to an oxygen tank. This joke contrasted the anodyne, aspirational beauty ideals which Ken represented with the physical ravages of illness and death. Like much of DPN’s humor, it was ultimately a way of rejecting victimhood, a refusal to be the object of pity.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, Magic Earring Ken lives on as a meme, while more recent interpretations of the character have had a distinctly gay flavour: take </span><em><span>Toy Story 3 </span></em><span>(2010)</span><em><span>,</span></em><span> where a prissy, preening Ken boasts </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX82Q7Nf-5U"><span>about his fabulous walk-in closet</span></a><span> and treats Barbie to a catwalk performance set to a song by Chic. Because Ken </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> so</span><span> </span><span>bland and so kitsch, he provides rich fodder for various forms of satirical reinterpretation and, for gay men, a way of mocking our own aesthetic ideals. When </span><em><span>Barbie</span></em><span> is released next summer, we are sure to see the continuation of this rich tradition.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="t1dERdbgd5Q"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1dERdbgd5Q" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Internet Explorer officially joins the 27 club</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The online browser has retired after 27 years. Really cant believe this. @</h3>

<p><span>Long before <a href="/tag/instagram">Instagram</a> and <a href="/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> dominated the net, Internet Explorer was at the peak of its success. The online browser marks a moment in <a href="/science-tech/article/55404/1/why-are-we-all-so-obsessed-with-web-1-nostalgia">early internet history</a> when Microsoft dominated the tech world; a portal into the web at a time when dial-in was the norm and <a href="/life-culture/article/50194/1/the-blackberry-phone-most-iconic-y2k-moments-paris-hilton-kim-kardashian">Blackberrys</a> were the phone du jour.</span></p>
<p>Now, the much-maligned online browser, is dead after 27 years. Microsoft is officially telling users to move on and switch to its newer Edge browser instead.</p><p><span>Microsoft released the first version of Internet Explorer in 1995. Its launch was the beginning of the end of Navigator, the tech giant’s previous browser. But the search engine was notoriously slow, prone to crashing and bugs. It was eventually replaced by more reliable engines such as Firefox. </span></p>
<p><span>These days, Chrome dominates internet search engines with roughly a 65 per cent share of the global browser market. It’s followed by Apple’s Safari at 19 per cent.</span><span></span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Six young creatives pushing culture forward through TikTok</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">In the final instalment of our Icons in the Making series, we profile six rising TikTokers that are moving the culture dial, from raising disability awareness with drag to putting 2022 spins on iconic tracks</h3>

<p><span>TikTok is changing culture. That's undeniable. It's also changing the conversations we have online. It’s not just an app designed for dancing videos and silly trends – many creators use their platform to educate their audiences on the most pressing social issues and start important narratives.</span></p>
<p><span>Dazed and TikTok have joined forces for our collaborative </span><a href="/life-culture/article/56109/1/tiktok-icons-in-the-making"><span>Icons in the Making</span></a><span> series. Each week we’ll be profiling up-and-coming TikTokers from across four key categories: entertainment, fashion, beauty, and culture. This week, we’ll be showcasing six creators who are driving culture forwards on TikTok.</span></p><p><span>In an age of information overload, it’s so difficult to create content that cuts through the noise. But on TikTok, creators are blazing the cultural trail. From singers making hits from their teenage bedrooms to drag artists documenting their showstopping glam routines while pushing disability visibility, TikTok is a space for some of the most important emerging cultural voices right now.</span></p>
<p><span>Below are six young creatives changing the face of culture on TikTok.</span></p><h2>BENJY</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@benjy_lookbook?lang=en">Benjy</a> is a 26-year-old content creator from south London with over 200,00 followers. Since joining TikTok in January 2021, he’s been blessing FYPs with informative, engaging content that advocates for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@benjy_lookbook/video/7102868817184820486?is_from_webapp=1amp;sender_device=pcamp;web_id=7051568749150160389">diversity and inclusion</a> and sparks open conversations about topics including racism, homophobia and sexism.</span></p><h2>DRAG SYNDROME </h2><p><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dragsyndromeofficial?lang=en">Drag Syndrome</a> is glamourous and groundbreaking in equal parts. They’re a drag collective made up of queens and kings with Down’s syndrome: Horrora Shebang, Justin Bond, Lady Francesca, Nikita Gold, Lady Mercury, and Davina Starr. A formidable force in the drag world, the collective has even worked with <em>Vogue</em> and RuPaul's DragCon.</span></p><h2>NAOMI EL</h2><p><span>Naomi Eluwa went viral after making a TikTok video in 2020 detailing her experiences of racism following the murder of George Floyd. Since then, she’s used her TikTok as a platform for raising awareness about innumerable social issues, like mental health and sustainable fashion.</span></p><h2>DJ KRYSTAL LAKE </h2><p><span>London-based <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djkrystallake?lang=en">Krystal Lake</a> blew up on TikTok over lockdown, and now, she has over half a million followers. Most of her videos are accessible explainers on social justice issues, from why the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djkrystallake/video/7067612835274099974?is_copy_url=1amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;lang=en">‘blue lives matter’</a> flag is racist to a rundown on what <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@djkrystallake/video/6981534886305828102?is_copy_url=1amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;lang=en">‘colourism’</a> means. And that’s not all – offline, Krystal Lake is Ashnikko’s official DJ.</span></p><h2>PRECIOUS</h2><p><span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@preciouspepala?lang=en">Precious</a> is a 17-year-old singer from Sheffield. Her TikTok is brimming with covers of classic songs – her rendition of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@preciouspepala/video/7098042690629012741?is_copy_url=1amp;is_from_webapp=v1amp;lang=en">Radiohead’s “Creep”</a> is particularly beautiful – but what’s more impressive is her own material. Her first, original song is set to be <a href="https://laylo.com/preciouspepala/sMreU">released later this month</a>.</span></p><h2>MILLY EVANS</h2><p><span>Milly Evans is a 22-year-old sex educator and author. </span><span>Their TikTok is both informative and engaging, with videos that dispel myths about reproductive health and provide the answers that school never did. And that’s not all: they’ve been involved in sex education advocacy since their teens, and even contributed to the national campaign to make sex education compulsory in England.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>When </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/guilhermedasilvaphoto/"><span>Guilherme da Silva</span></a><span> began taking photos at age 15, he didn’t have any references and had, admittedly, no idea what he was doing. That was until an interested teacher pointed him in the direction of <a href="/tag/nan-goldin">Nan Goldin,</a></span><span> and from there, he also discovered <a href="/tag/david-armstrong">David Armstrong</a>. It was like stumbling on a goldmine where he felt validated and connected to something larger than his home country of Brazil, where its laws violently discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. “Now their works play a huge part in my research on LGBTQ+ photography,” da Silva tells me. “Because most of what I’ve been doing is portraits, and that’s my interest: people. And most of all, my community.”</span></p>
<p><span>It’s his community that he turns the spotlight on in his zine, </span><em><span>Overture</span></em><span>, a celebration of queer Brazillian youth living in an oppressive political climate. In da Silva’s constructed world though, they are free to be who they want. Inspired by the idea of Arcadia, as painted by Thomas Eakins, da Silva photographs bodies at leisure, in pleasure, with lush, green grass.</span></p>
<p><span>With plans to leave his homeland behind in search of spaces that are more accepting of him and his vision, </span><em><span>Overture</span></em><span> feels like a parting gift, with illustrations from da Silva’s boyfriend, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucasbassetto/"><span>Lucas Bassetto</span></a><span>. Below, da Silva debuts the zine and speaks about the art and poetry that inspired it, the reality of life as a queer person in Brazil, and his hopes for the future.</span></p>
<p><strong>You were inspired by the idea of “Arcadia”. Can you tell us how that translates into the imagery? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Guilherme da Silva: </strong><span>The concept of Arcadia in art and poetry is about harmony with nature – like an Edenic life where its inhabitants are often portrayed celebrating their lives in this utopian land uncorrupted by civilisation. I was inspired to create this world where my friends and I could live this fantasy of being somewhere else in the universe.</span><strong> </strong><span>It’s a sylvan realm, like the paintings of Thomas Eakins who inspired me with the golden, sun-kissed colour palette in some of the pictures.</span></p>
<p><span>I wanted to do the gay twist of <a href="/art-photography/article/49288/1/justine-kurland-girl-pictures-photographs-rebellious-teen-wild-america-land">Justine Kurland’s <em>Girl Pictures</em></a>, someone I’ve been looking up to a lot lately. Her runaway girls and the story behind her book, the political eye, were a huge inspiration in the middle of the whole process of the zine. I wanted to be dramatic, but I also wanted to show the youthful bliss of being able to be who you are in this place where nobody judges anyone.</span></p><p><strong>This zine gives a romantic view of being LGBTQ+ in Brazil, but what is the reality like for these communities?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guilherme da Silva: </strong><span>I was born and raised in the southern region of Brazil, colonised by Italy and Germany. Everyone is very conservative there. Luckily my family is not, so my home was a safe space, but outside was a nightmare.</span></p>
<p><span>As a gay kid, I suffered a lot during my school years. I had anxiety and panic attacks during high school, and I’ve been threatened, beaten up, and suffered a lot of verbal abuse. As an adult, I don’t know if I can see a change. It’s not been easy since Bolsonaro won the elections in 2018. That’s why I wanted to create this dream-like fantasy with my work, to escape the reality of this country that has never been kind to us.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope things will change because right now, reality scares my people and me a lot. Brazil is the country that most kills transgender people, and it’s been hard to live with this information daily.</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><strong>You’ve experienced homophobic attitudes yourself in regards to your practice. How did that impact the images you made?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guilherme da Silva: </strong><span>When I moved to Sao Paulo, I started being commissioned for brands and magazines as a fashion photographer. Most of the photographers I admire did this kind of job, so I was very happy that I was following this path and getting some money.</span></p>
<p><span>But then I noticed that the industry wasn’t so friendly with LGBTQ people when I was called to do an editorial for the Brazilian part of a well-known worldwide men’s publication. The editor asked me not to choose any ‘feminine’ ‘gay-like’ guys for the casting because the magazine was not for ‘sassies’. I was in shock at first, I could barely talk, and I left.</span></p>
<p><span>In Brazil, we don’t have many publications; most of them don’t give any freedom unless you are straight. I stepped away from these kinds of editorial jobs and be pickier when I received a proposal. It’s been two years, and it’s helped me to clean my eye and be more focused on my personal work. I still hear some shit from people saying that my personal work is not good enough to get commercial jobs, that there are only pictures of LGBTQ people on my Instagram, and I should ‘photograph cisgender female new face girls’ so clients could see that I’m capable of being commissioned. It’s an everyday struggle, but I don’t hear this kind of ‘advice’. That’s how I created this body of work – by believing in myself. </span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><strong>How do Brazil’s queer communities express themselves under the oppression they face?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guilherme da Silva: </strong><span>We spend most of our childhood and teenage years trying to hide, and when we are adults, we don’t really know who we are. You have to start to say yes to yourself and no to the kind of advice you hear from straight people disguised as someone who is trying to help you. You have to listen to queer people, research queer history, watch queer movies, be as queer as you can be, and choose your friends if you don’t have a family who supports you. You have to be your most fervorous supporter and never, ever, ever let an old straight white man tell you what to do.</span></p>
<p><strong>What do you hope to show by publishing this zine?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Guilherme da Silva: </strong><span>The title speaks a lot for me. I want to show that this is only the beginning of my self-publications. I think it’s a good way to start this portfolio. The message is there – I hope when people see the pictures, they feel transported to this world, laying on the grass with the sun, listening to a Lana Del Rey song, being free to be who they want to be.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>Toxic Twitter discourse on trans issues can often make it seem like there are TERFs literally everywhere, but new research has found that the British public are not as polarised over trans rights as the internet may make it seem. </span><a href="https://www.moreincommon.org.uk/our-work/research/britons-and-gender-identity/"><span>New research</span></a><span> from the More in Common organisation has found that the average person approaches gender identity issues with “compassion”.</span></p>
<p><span>“Many of our findings are reassuring. The public do not approach the issue of gender identity through a hyper-political lens. Instead, their common starting point is one of compassion,” the report reads.</span></p>
<p><span>“They understand that for many trans people life can be difficult and most think as a society we have a responsibility to make it less so. None of the people we spoke to, from across the ideological spectrum, saw the debate in terms of a battle over the definition of womanhood, or thought that trans people were a threat. Instead, they saw very practical issues needing practical solutions.”</span></p><p><span>The report, which is thought to be the most in-depth study to date of public attitudes towards trans rights, also found that the majority of Britons agree that schools should talk to pupils about trans issues. </span><span>There was absolutely no suggestion that normal people are worried that schools, campaigners or charities were “pushing children to transition”, as some anti-trans figures have suggested.</span></p>
<p><span>The survey also found that while right-wing papers often run inflammatory and harmful stories about trans people, just 2 per cent of participants identified trans issues as one of the top issues facing the country. 64 per cent identified the cost of living crisis as the most pressing issue.</span></p>
<p><span>When asked “is a trans man a man and a trans woman a woman?”, most participants either agreed or said they didn’t know, with a minority of 32 per cent saying they actively disagreed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Gen Z and Millennials were more likely to agree with this statement than other, older generations.</span></p>
<p><span>The report stressed that these promising results do not mean we can get complacent. “The danger is that unless healthier and better debate can be created, the all-or-nothing approaches of highly engaged activists could bleed into the public consciousness and lead to wider polarisation that serves no one (or their cause) well.”</span></p>
<p><span>“The notion that Britons fail to grasp the complexity of this issue is at best ignorant and, at worst, actively patronising,” it continues. “Britons are aware of the issues and want sensible, sound and tailored solutions to problems which are not abstract debates, but instead real issues that affect their friends, families and colleagues. The British public is not well served by noisy debates, inflammatory tweets or reductive questions.”</span></p>]]>

<p><span>Ziggy Stardust needs no introduction. Devised in the early 70s, <a href="/david-bowie">David Bowie</a>’s first – and most famous – stage persona is instantly recognisable by his flame-red mullet, space-age make-up, and outfits that crossed sci-fi dystopias with </span><span>Japanese kabuki theatre and the androgyny of glam rock. In fact, it’s arguably the alien rockstar’s striking visuals, as much as his music with The Spiders From Mars, that secured his lasting cultural legacy, which continues to this day.</span></p>
<p><span>In 2022, more than ever, Bowie’s uncompromising approach to self-expression and sexual fluidity in the Ziggy era feels particularly relevant, reflected in an emerging virtual world where shape-shifting avatars and alter egos reign supreme. This June,</span><span> many fans will also mark the 50th anniversary of the character’s debut on the eponymous concept album </span><em><span>The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars</span></em><span>, further highlighting the Bowie’s visionary work in the spheres of music, fashion, and visual art.</span></p><p><span>To coincide with these celebrations, Adobe is releasing a new pack of Bowie-themed digital tools across its Creative Cloud apps, in collaboration with Bowie75, as the latest iteration of its ongoing initiative to bring to life historic tools from artists that have changed the world, and place them in the hands of modern creators. First launched with a digital recreation of Edvard Munch’s paint brushes, this project has also seen Adobe revive the lost typography of <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/discover/article/adobe-x-bauhaus-dessau?locale=en">Bauhaus Dessau</a>, and was last seen in 2020, with the release of a vast array of brushes inspired by the legendary 1980s New York artist, <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/cc/discover/article/keith-haring?locale=en">Keith Haring</a>.</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>The Bowie-themed collection will include digital tools such as textures, patterns, and stickers featuring some of the most iconic Ziggy Stardust imagery, including the gold “astral sphere” that adorned Ziggy’s forehead, and psychedelic patterns that could have been lifted from designs by his go-to style icon, <a href="/tag/kansai-yamamoto">Kansai Yamamoto</a> – plus the famed red-and-blue lightning bolt from <em>Aladdin Sane</em>. Also including more creator-oriented tools, such as one-off paintbrushes, palettes, and textures, the Adobe x Bowie collection offers fans a chance to tap into Bowie’s trailblazing creativity and self-expression, and to experiment with their own out-of-this-world looks. </span></p>
<p><span>The tools – which feature over 150 new graphics, colour swatches, vectors, patterns, and stickers – are available throughout Adobe Creative Cloud for Photoshop, Illustrator, Fresco, Substance, and Adobe Express users worldwide. They also include a range of make-up brushes named after some of Bowie’s biggest hits, such as “Ashes”, “Changes”, “Major Tom”, and “Queen Bish”.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>For budding creatives who are looking for even more inspiration amid the anniversary celebrations, Adobe will be opening up the vibrant environment that spawned Ziggy Stardust. On July 1, as part of Adobe’s acceleration of the Future of Creativity and exploration of new, immersive worlds, Adobe is launching </span><a href="https://adobexbowie75.com/?lang=en"><em><span>Bowie’s Dressing Room</span></em></a><span>, </span><span>a virtual rendition of the musician’s London dressing room, where Bowie invented, and dressed, the persona five decades ago.</span></p>
<p><span>Fancy exploring new modes of self-expression? Take a look at <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/lead/creativecloud/bowie75.html?mv=affiliateamp;mv2=redamp;cgen=C8K12M24amp;mv=other">Adobe’s new tools</a> for constructing your own alter ego, and share your own Bowie inspired persona on social media using the #AdobexBowie hashtag.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>From </span><a href="https://www.thesaintfoundation.org/community/hanky-code-bob-damrons-address-book"><span>handkerchiefs</span></a><span> to </span><a href="/beauty/head/article/48424/1/hair-trend-sexuality-bisexual-bob-bleach-blonde-kristen-stewart-frank-ocean"><span>haircuts</span></a><span>, queer people have a long history of flagging their sexual preferences through their personal appearance, and tattoos have often been a key non-verbal signal. In 1950s Chicago, future Hells Angel official tattoo artist </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/books/26secret.html"><span>Samuel Stewart</span></a><span> AKA Doc Sparrow began recording the reasons why his clients – 20 per cent of whom he estimated were gay – were getting tattooed. Alongside sadomasochism, narcissism and “aliveness”, homosexuality was listed as one of his noted 25 motivations.  </span></p>
<p><span>These tattoos often code for those in the LGBTQ+ community to identify themselves and others. Cryptic symbols such as the Hells Angels Air Force patch with a winged black circle either meant the Angel had a male preference, or alternatively initiated a gay-bashing, the multiple interpretations allowing for defence in hostile homophobic environments. </span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, at the same time across the country in Buffalo, New York, Dirty Dick’s tattoo parlour on Chippewa Street became the place for lesbians to receive a </span><a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Boots_of_Leather_Slippers_of_Gold.html?id=0T8F0daflZ4Camp;redir_esc=y"><span>blue nautical star tattoo</span></a><span>. Butches and femmes alike would get the star inked, often on their wrists so it was easily covered by a watch to avoid being identified. Despite this, Buffalo police soon began recognising the symbol and recording names.</span></p>
<p><span>Today, queer tattoos have become an outlet to outwardly express and connect with our sexuality. As a femme lesbian, frustrated with being perceived as straight, this year I had a pair of scissors tattooed by my friend and dyke-centred tattoo artist, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bratking_666/"><span>Harrow</span></a><span>. Confidently claiming my sexuality, from then on I’ve been bonded to my lesbian identity, and have found the power to confidently say “I’m a lesbian” to anyone who asks what my tattoo means.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>For Harrow, who has numerous queer tattoos herself, the designs symbolise a celebration of lesbianism. “Being a lesbian is something I’m proud of, I’m happy to wear that on my sleeve for everyone to see,” she explains. “It’s not just how I dress or how I do my hair, it will always be a part of me.” As well as the nautical star, the dyke symbols featured in her flash will include the labrys – adopted by lesbians in the 1970s connected to the strength of the Ancient Greek Amazonian weapon – and the double Venus symbol. </span></p>
<p><span>Her fiancé Gideon, who taught her how to tattoo, stands nearly head-to-toe in an amalgamation of queer designs. Her first dyke tattoos, which she did herself, are Venus symbols on each thumb and the word ‘boi’ on her hand, which serves as a “self manifesto” to assure her identity as a non-conforming dyke. “Fighting back and forth between how you feel about your body and how society feels about your body, I think it was very affirming to have something on my dominant hand,” she says. “I just look down and there it is, I see it all the time.” For Harrow and Gideon, tattoos have allowed them to feel assured within their identities, so when they’re tattooing each other or clients, their spirits can be shared.</span></p>
<p><span>Expressing queer sexual desire unapologetically, the work of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/limpwrist.tattoo/"><span>Frankie</span></a><span> draws from notable queer kink imagery and artwork, as well as LGBTQ+ icons. “My queerness informs and directly correlates with the kinds of designs I produce, my ethics and practices when tattooing, and the type of clients who are interested in my work,” they say. From cover designs from erotic mags like Honcho or </span><a href="/artsandculture/article/21052/1/pushing-boundaries-with-sex-and-literature"><span>On Our Backs</span></a><span> to scenes of BDSM sex, Frankie’s explicit depictions of queer identity, desire and liberation take flagging to a beautifully bold extreme. It was their own desire to be tattooed with kinky queer imagery that kickstarted this distinctive sexy aesthetic – their most recent one being a Robert Mapplethorpe image. “I love Mapplethorpe’s work and this image included a kink reference I really loved – if you’ve seen me flagging my yellow bandana this is no surprise!” </span></p>
<p><span>It’s not just outward displays of identity and pride that tattoos can inspire. Significantly, tattoos have the power to intimately validate one’s identity. The word ‘changeling’ is tattooed across the torso of zine and printmaker Joe Earthling. While researching Irish folklore as a source for his art degree, Joe discovered the changeling metaphor that he found “so apt for transness”. A young girl is taken by faeries and turned into inanimate objects, meanwhile the parents mourn their child unknowing that the girl lives on as something different. Joe got his tattoo in secret, as a small act of rebellion, not revealing to his family the tattoo’s meaning. “It’s like a badge of honour now, a big stamp which is really beautiful and changes my body when I can’t afford to medically transition.”</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="13" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CZcaHVnsvz0/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
                </div>
<p><span>As a trans-non-binary tattoo artist, </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/story.tatter/"><span>Billy’s</span></a><span> tattoos have helped them through their journey of transitioning, decorating their body to be totally individual. Their favourite tattoo reads TRANSCIENCE, across their stomach, as an assertion that their transness is a fact. “My tattoos have helped me feel grounded and connected to my body. I know who I am, and what I’ve been through when I look at them, they all help to tell my story.” The joyful flash designs of Billy showcase the beauty of trans bodies, often with top surgery scars, surrounded by smiling sunshine and stars. “We create something together, in a safe, affirming way, something that helps them feel better in their body,” Billy says. “[The tattoos] are a way of reclaiming the body. In a world where our identities are belittled every day, these practices are so important.”</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike many previous generations, this collaborative creative process of queer tattooing can now be done in a space that is safe, open and welcoming. Nova – who themselves has a queer tattoo paying tribute to the television series </span><em><span>Steven Universe</span></em><span> and the trans narrative of Steven – manages the proudly Black and queer-owned </span><a href="https://helltopaystudio.com/"><span>Hell To Pay tattoo and piercing studio</span></a><span>. “I’ve always wanted to make sure that in everything that I do, I include and give back to the community that shaped me,” they say. </span></p>
<p><span>“When I began my journey with Hell to Pay, I wanted to make sure that the studio was somewhere you came and felt you were home.” Tattooing is a very intimate act, it is thanks to these spaces that queer tattoo artists and members of the LGBTQ+ community can have the opportunity to be tattooed safely. “I love the fact that we can be a place where queer people can come, feel open and just free to be completely 100 per cent themselves while getting something that realistically requires a lot of trust,” says Nova.  </span></p>
<p><span>Either with secretive suggestive symbolism or loud and proud expressions of sexuality, tattoos let us take back our bodies as our own, defining and adorning ourselves against a heteronormative society. To be inked, ultimately reminds us and the world that we exist – even when the line work begins to fade, our pride never will.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>What’s an It-label without its own It-bag? For decades, fashion houses have been defined by the purses they proffer, with devotees demonstrating their allegiance to their fave designers by carrying their styles in the crook of their arm. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, <a href="https://www.self-portrait.com/collections/handbags">self-portrait</a> is getting in on the act, by dropping its first-ever bag for the summer of 2022. Founded in 2013, the London-based label founded by Han Chong has become the go-to for feminine dressing with a twist, finding fans in everyone from <a href="/gigi-hadid">Gigi</a> and <a href="/bella-hadid">Bella Hadid</a>, to <a href="/j-lo">J.Lo</a> and Dakota Johnson.</span></p><p><span>It makes sense, then, that self-portrait’s new Bow Bag encapsulates the house’s innate femininity. Bringing together clean lines, sleek leather, and intricate detailing, the boxy Bow Bag is a timeless style that comes in a multitude of understated colourways, finished with an ornate crystal-encrusted or gold-plated ribbon.  </span></p>
<p><span>And, as big bags and small bags battle it out on runways around the world, self-portrait has thought between the lines by releasing two sizes: one, a ladylike mini, designed for your essentials, with the second a tiny micro number just large enough for phone, keys, and perhaps a lipstick (expect to see self-portrait stan Paris Hilton toting her own at an event any day now). </span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>“I really like the idea of finding a shape that felt classic and at the same time encapsulates the free spirit of the self-portrait woman,” says Chong. “The Bow Bag’s shape – strong yet feminine, is a timeless design with a happy uplifting twist. A natural evolution of our product offering, bags will now be at the heart of our collections – and the Bow Bag felt like the best way to debut the category.” </span></p>
<p><span>Alongside the launch of the Bow Bag comes a new campaign, in which none other than iconic supermodel <a href="/Naomi-campbell">Naomi Campbell</a> stars. Taking inspiration from Brandy and Monica’s iconic 90s track “The Boy Is Mine” – all nostalgic styling by Haley Wollens and soft focus finishes courtesy of photographer and filmmaker Renell Medrano<a href="/haley-wollens"></a> – Campbell is seen propped against a wall, bag in hand, and sprawled out on a bed in looks from the label’s upcoming AW22 collection. In a tongue-in-cheek move, the series and accompanying film takes the name ‘The Bow Is Mine’. Question is: are you going to make it yours? </span></p>

<p><span>If </span><a href="/tag/aw22"><span>AW22</span></a><span> was the season that fashion got freaky then </span><a href="https://www.collectwithpurpose.com/13615973/lovely-paper-weight-can-i-wank-with-it?"><span>Sunnei</span></a><span> was one of its most mad-making merchants. As guests were made to stand (not sit) on metal benches, designers Simone Rizzo and Loris Messina debuted a collection that bucked the traditional form of clothing, full of neoprene tailoring and the kind of tactile knitwear which looked as though it had been forged from a microfibre cleaning mitt or some kind of tendrilous car-washing column. </span></p><p><span>Of course, Sunnei has never taken itself too seriously – TBT to those </span><a href="/fashion/article/55305/1/sunnei-high-fashion-sex-toys-wellness-wanking-dildo-butt-plug-anal-beads"><span>glass-blown dildos</span></a><span> – and this offering was no different, with models running (not walking) in colour-blocked compression tops and cloaking outerwear crafted with sloping, curvilinear zips.

<p><span>“T</span><span>his was a dangerous landscape for an eyelinered young homo to be flitting about,” writes </span><span><a href="https://jamieatherton.com/">Jaime Atherton</a>, recalling his experience of London in the mid-90s. “</span><span>My wanderings were tinged with fear: lone strangers, groups of lads, flashes of panic upon realising I was truly lost. East London wasn’t empty, of course; lives were being lived everywhere. But when I was at art school in the 90s, I was new to the metropolis and seeking something else. In a wooded cemetery I scribbled over the sharpie swastikas on a bench with glitter-pen.” </span></p><p><span>Atherton conjures up these memories in the beautiful accompanying text of photographer </span><a href="https://marcvallee.co.uk/"><span>Marc Vallée</span></a><span>’s series </span><em><span>When I was at Art School in the 90s</span></em><span>. Once flatmates living in a shared student house, Vallée’s images of Atherton and their third housemate, Lloyd, seem to perfectly distill the undone glamour of the 90s</span><span>. “We went to the same art school,” Vallée explains in an email conversation. “We were at The Cass opposite the Whitechapel Gallery, with Brick Lane just around the corner. We were also part of the same 90s alternative queer scene. We went to Popstarz, and to Ghetto which was behind the London Astoria.”</span></p>
<p><span>Their house in Stratford appears like a film set-perfect time capsule of midcentury wallpaper and soft furnishings – an era as distant at the time as the 90s themselves are for us now. </span><span>Details of items in the rooms seem to take on the significance of relics preserved in time, a layer of meaning the photographer had no intention of at the time. “When I was shooting the images, what you describe as ‘artefacts’ were just posters and books that happened to be in the rooms,” he says. “But when I was editing the images for the zine, the Nirvana poster did trigger a memory of dancing to ‘Smells Like Teen Spirit’ on a dance floor of a club and I thought that the image has to go in. In a way, it helps to lock in the period and acts as a soundtrack to the images.”</span></p>	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1320/5/1325691.jpg" alt="Marc Vall#233;e, “Lloyd”, London (1998)" />		<figcaption>
Marc Vall#233;e, “Lloyd”, London (1998)			<span class="fl-credit">Photography Marc Vall#233;e</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><span>“I made the pictures before I was known as a documentary photographer, but they are a document of that time and place,” Vallee tells me. “The house, posters, objects and the clothes the boys are wearing are authentic and not constructed by me. But it was a collaboration of sorts, moving from one room to another, changing outfits and removing clothes. Jamie and Lloyd were not boyfriends but the images do present an ambiguous ‘reality’, my gaze, maybe even my desire, is definitely in the mix.”</span></p>
<p><span>As 90s nostalgia continues to apex, a renewed interest in the decade’s styles and subcultures may have created an opportunity for Vallée to share his work from this period with a younger audience, but his images are ever shot with a future audience in mind. “</span><span>My work is rooted in the here and now, documenting the lives of people in pursuit of their own desires and identities and that’s what fascinates me,” he says. “Nostalgia is tricky. When I’m shooting a project today, I’m not thinking about how I can exploit the pictures in 20 years’ time. My focus is on the subject, issues and people I’m documenting. And that was what I was doing in the 90s.”</span></p>
<p><span>He’s also resistant to nostalgia when I ask him to hark back to the London he knew as a student. “</span><span>I don’t want to fall into a Generation X trap of saying that things were better in my day,” he concludes. “Young queer people today are doing all sorts of intriguing and amazing things, despite the chaos of the last two years.”</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Watch Harry Styles be gay in the first trailer for My Policeman</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Bottoms and tops, we all hate cops (apart from Harry Styles)</h3>

<div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="BKwrjcANM6M"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BKwrjcANM6M" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Since <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> was <a href="/film-tv/article/50498/1/harry-styles-lily-james-set-to-star-adaptation-of-queer-love-story-my-policeman">announced</a> as the star of gay love story </span><em><span>My Policeman</span></em><span>, stans have been clamouring for a sneak preview of the film, </span><a href="/film-tv/article/52698/1/fans-share-a-first-glimpse-of-harry-styles-and-emma-corrin-in-my-policeman"><span>lining the streets</span></a><span> of the set in Brighton. Now, we finally have an official first look at Styles as the titular bobby, Tom Burgess, with the release of a teaser trailer.</span></p>
<p><span>Also starring <a href="/emma-corrin">Emma Corrin</a> as Burgess’ wife, schoolteacher Marion Burgess, alongside David Dawson as museum curator Patrick Hazelwood (with whom he has a secret affair), </span><em><span>My Policeman </span></em><span>revolves around their love triangle in 1950s Britain, where homosexuality was still illegal. Some scenes will also fast-forward to the 90s, with the older characters portrayed by Gina McKee, Linus Roache, and Rupert Everett.</span></p><p>In the new teaser trailer from the film, we see Tom and Patrick share knowing glances over a Turner painting, Styles throwing it back to the <a href="/fashion/article/50275/1/thirsty-tiktok-trend-horny-men-short-five-5-inch-inseam-shorts-style">five-inch inseam summer</a> of 2020 on the beach (need we say more?), and the inevitable fallout of the affair.</p>
<p><em><span>My Policeman </span></em><span>is based </span><span>on </span><span>Bethan Roberts’ 2012 novel of the same name, written by acclaimed screenwriter Ron Nyswaner, and directed by Michael Grandage. The film is set to debut in cinemas on October 21, and hit Prime Video on November 4. </span><span>Of course, if you can’t wait that long to watch Harry Styles take his clothes off in the 1950s, then there’s also Olivia Wilde’s </span><a href="/film-tv/article/56016/1/harry-styles-florence-pugh-dont-worry-darling-trailer-olivia-wilde"><em><span>Don’t Worry Darling</span></em></a><span> </span><span>to look forward to.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://globalfashionsummit.com/"><span>The Global Fashion Summit: Copenhagen Edition</span></a><span>, previously known as the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, is an international forum for sustainable fashion. First launched in 2019, the 2022 meeting marked the first in-person event since the pandemic. Panels, keynote speeches, and a deeply awkward meditation session were all part of the programme which followed the theme “Alliances for a new era”.</span></p>
<p><span>Not quite as exciting or shareable as fashion week, this industry event hasn’t really found its way into the general fashion discourse yet, but once you mined down past endless mentions of ‘stakeholders’, ‘value chains’, and ‘sectoral approaches’, there were some interesting talking points and bold voices to be found –  and there are plenty of aspects to be improved too. Here’s what you need to know.</span></p><h1><strong>THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong></h1>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>Given the amount of press in attendance, the GFS is the perfect time for brands to announce big new plans. On day one, </span><a href="/tag/ralph-lauren"><span>Ralph Lauren</span></a><span> announced the launch of ‘Live On’, a new circularity strategy that will “enable all past and future products to live on responsibly by 2030”, according to </span><a href="https://www.voguebusiness.com/sustainability/ralph-lauren-sees-timeless-designs-as-driver-of-rental-repair-and-resale"><em><span>Vogue Business</span></em></a><span>. A multi-layered plan, the brand will apply different solutions to different products. For instance, for long-lasting pieces like handbags, repair will be key, while for less durable products like t-shirts, recycling will likely play a bigger role. </span><a href="https://www.c2ccertified.org/get-certified/product-certification"><span>Cradle to cradle certification</span></a><span> for certain items and ramping up resale are all part of the plan too.</span></p>
<p><span>Circularity also played a part in Copenhagen-based </span><a href="/tag/ganni"><span>GANNI</span></a><span>’s introduction of three “Fabrics of the Future”. A collaboration with zero-waste woven textile company </span><a href="https://www.stem.page/"><span>Stem</span></a><span>, also based in the Danish capital, came in the form of a three-piece, circular </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CeiYmfdr4Th/"><span>denim-esque collection</span></a><span> comprising a dress, jacket, and trousers; </span><a href="https://www.mylo-unleather.com/"><span>Mylo</span></a><span>, a mycelium-based leather alternative, was used for limited edition wallets and one-of-a-kind bags; and </span><a href="https://circulo.se/"><span>Circulose</span></a><span> (well, 15 per cent of it mixed with viscose) was the material of choice for two new pairs of trousers which will be launched for pre-fall. “80-85 per cent of our carbon footprint is derived from the product, so obviously it’s a huge priority for us,” said GANNI founder Nicolaj Reffstrup.</span></p>
<p><span>Other announcements included the news that Hamp;M Group and Lululemon were amongst the funders for a new $250million <a href="https://apparelimpact.org/press-release-apparel-impact-institute-announces-lead-funders-for-new-250m-fashion-climate-fund-uniting-brands-philanthropic-donors-and-industry-stakeholders/">Fashion Climate Fund</a> to “decarbonise and modernise” supply chains, and Mulberry revealed the introduction of Digital IDs to its leather products (rolling out to all products by 2025) to make tracing product origins, reselling, and authentication much, much easier.</span><span></span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>The announcement that got the biggest reaction by far, however, was when Liz Ricketts, from the </span><a href="https://theor.org/"><span>Or Foundation</span></a><span>, a non-profit based working out of </span><a href="https://gal-dem.com/fast-fashion-uk-kantamanto-market-ghana/"><span>Kantamanto</span></a><span>, revealed that SHEIN would be providing $15 million over three years as part of its new EPR (Extended Producer Responsibility) Fund. There were both gasps and cheers from the audience and, later, a very mixed reaction on social media with some </span><a href="https://twitter.com/venetialamanna/status/1534498645088817152"><span>supporting it</span></a><span> and others </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CeiaWDkA71G/"><span>heavily criticising</span></a><span> the move. The funding is absolutely necessary - 15 million garments a week arrive in Ghana, a country of 32 million people and according to Ricketts, 40 per cent of what arrives ends up as waste - but Shein, whose production </span><a href="https://twitter.com/GoodOnYou_App/status/1512070842561142806"><span>outstrips</span></a><span> that of the likes of </span><a href="/fashion/article/53813/1/fast-fashion-8p-dress-boohoo-sustainability-exploitation-greenwashing-sweatshop"><span>boohoo</span></a><span>, Zara, and Hamp;M to an almost u</span><span>nbelievable degree, was likely the last brand people would expect to support the Or Foundation’s work.</span></p>
<p><span>The money will be used on a number of different initiatives including expanding an apprenticeship programme for the young women who carry heavy bales, piloting recycling initiatives, and incubating businesses which turn the textile waste into new products. Some of the money will also be redistributed to “allied organisations in Ghana”. </span><span></span></p>
<p><span>After making the announcement, Ricketts threw down the gauntlet to the brands in the room, calling on them to admit that their clothes end up in Kantamanto, and take financial responsibility for the environmental and social harm they cause. “We have been calling on brands to pay the bill that is due to the communities who have been managing their waste, and this is a significant step toward accountability. What we see as truly revolutionary is SHEIN’s acknowledgement that their clothing may be ending up here in Kantamanto, a simple fact that no other major fashion brand has been willing to state as yet,” Ricketts said.</span></p>

<p><span>While the phrase “Eight years to go…” loomed over the shoulders of all speakers as part of the set, alluding to the climate targets which need to be met by 2030, the atmosphere wasn’t as revolutionary or urgent as you might hope. But there were a few voices which stood out. </span></p>
<p><span>Liv Simpliciano of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/fash_rev/?hl=en"><span>Fashion Revolution</span></a><span> was the first to mention the need for degrowth, a stark contrast against Adam Karlsson, CFO of Hamp;M Group, noting, “we are and we always will be a growth company”. A removal from the many corporate voices which dominated the conference, Simplicano served up a reminder: “There’s no fashion on a dead planet.”</span></p>
<p><span><a href="/fashion/article/53896/1/vintage-violence-uganda-africa-secondhand-clothing-cotton-industry-podcast">Bobby Kolade</a> is the designer behind <a href="/fashion/gallery/30909/8/buzigahill-return-to-sender">BUZIGAHILL</a>, a brand which redesigns secondhand clothes and “redistributes them in the global north, where they originated from”. He also refused to sugarcoat the exportation of waste. “Africa is no longer a charity box,” he said. “You have your own system, throw it away and deal with it!”</span><span></span></p>

                </div>
<p><span>The list of brands and companies present at the summit was almost endless. The likes of GANNI, ASOS, Hamp;M, </span><a href="/tag/kering"><span>Kering</span></a><span>, Allbirds, </span><a href="/tag/burberry"><span>Burberry</span></a><span>, </span><a href="/tag/nike"><span>Nike</span></a><span>, and Ralph Lauren, were there alongside organisations including Fair Wear Foundation, Fashion Revolution, the UN and Fashion for Good. The Crown Princess of Denmark was also in attendance, speaking on the first morning. Having an entire room stand for royalty was certainly jarring given that the spectre of colonialism hung heavy over the venue.</span></p>
<p><span>Panels such as “Subverting Fashion’s Historical Exclusion” and “Histories And Futures For Fashion Education” featuring speakers including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fbrooksworth/?hl=en">Frederica Bosworth</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.ngozi/?hl=en">Ngozi Okaro</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/moussamchangama/?hl=en">Moussa Mchangama</a> brought themes of decolonisation, representation, and inclusion into the summit, and it was better for it, but the balance of voices was off and many were notably absent. “This forum is very Eurocentric, the majority of the brands here are from Europe… but all voices need to be heard,” said Shams Mahmud, who owns a denim manufacturing company in Bangladesh. </span></p>
<p><span>“I want to acknowledge that diversity of our speakers should be better,” Federica Marchionni, CEO of the Global Fashion Alliance, said, alluding to difficulties with travel. But it wasn’t the most compelling argument given that logistics were in place for the delivery of remote and pre-recorded addresses. Another summit is due to take place in SE Asia which, hopefully, may offer broader representation.</span></p>

<p><span>The summit wasn’t a perfect representation of perfect progress (which realistically doesn’t even exist) but that doesn’t mean there weren’t a few interesting ideas and initiatives on the table. Some things are happening that are moving fashion in the right direction, like sacrificing growth in the name of sustainability. “We’ve decided to phase out our virgin leather by 2023,” said Reffstrup. “It’s a huge part of our total sales but virgin leather is also a huge part of our carbon footprint, so there’s no way around it. We’ve got to do it.”</span></p>
<p><span>Fellow Copenhagen brand Cecilie Bahnsen is taking a similar approach in stripping back to two collections a year. “For me, it was the best decision we made,” said the brand’s eponymous designer. “Of course we knew it would mean that maybe financial growth would slow but this is what we need to keep the level of design and passion, focusing on creating the most beautiful product you fall in love with.”</span></p>
<p><span>Alongside focusing on the careful craft her brand is known for, Bahnsen is also getting stuck into data to make sure she’s making the right changes in the right places, and it’s a move being seen across the board. Vestiaire Collective, for instance, recently released its first</span> <a href="https://us.vestiairecollective.com/journal/our-first-impact-report/"><span>impact report</span></a><span>. Why, when the brand is considered a solution rather than a problem? “We can’t manage what we can’t measure,” said co-founder Sophie Hersan. Measuring impact is the only way brands will know whether their grand plans are actually doing any good, and for chief sustainability officer Dounia Wone, she wanted to know, among other things, if Vestiaire was offsetting new purchases, and if secondhand purchases had less impact than new. The answer to both was yes. So now the plan, she explained, is encouraging more local sales to reduce the impact of transit, and adding sustainability prompts to the platform so customers can make the best choices.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>Vestiaire’s investor Kering is also big on data, having created the pioneering </span><a href="https://www.kering.com/en/sustainability/measuring-our-impact/our-ep-l/"><span>Environmental Profit and Loss</span></a><span> (EPamp;L) tool which helps quantify environmental impact (something the secondhand platform has fully embraced). Now Kering is turning that exacting approach towards biodiversity. Having announced a biodiversity strategy a few years ago, it’s now settled on </span><a href="https://www.kering.com/en/sustainability/safeguarding-the-planet/regenerative-fund-for-nature/regenerative-fund-for-nature-selected-projects-for-2021/"><span>seven projects </span></a><span>in six countries where it will help protect and regenerate nature. “We looked at the environmental impacts through the EPamp;L, we identified the four big raw materials: cotton, leather, silk, and cashmere,” said Kering’s chief sustainability officer, Marie-Claire Daveu. “We are very conscious about what we know and what we don’t know so we decided to work with Conservation International (CI) to write the criteria for the projects.” </span></p>
<p><span>The projects include working with herders to restore ecosystems in Mongolia where cashmere is sourced, helping cotton farmers in India transition to organic agriculture, and implementing regenerative agricultural practices in South Africa. They represent a step towards Kering’s plan to convert 1 million hectares of land within its supply chain to regenerative agriculture by 2025, and to protect 1 million hectares which sits outside its supply chain.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Because there was so much talk about what needs to be done, those actually taking action were the ones that stood out. “There are so many things you can just do if you want to do it,” said Reffstrup. “The problem is that just doing it often involves money. It’s going to cost you money. But if you’re willing to invest, there are so many things you can do. Just do it instead of just talking about it.”</span></p>
<p><span>And really, that’s the message. Brands who do the most damage continue to pull up chairs on stage and talk about what needs to be done. But we’re way past the window for empty words and corporate back-patting. Action – measured, measurable action – is now the only thing that counts.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>As social creatures, we thrive creatively when surrounded by people who uplift us and inspire personal progress. Hence that saying your mum loves to share from time to time: “Show me your friends and I will tell you who you are.”</span></p>
<p><span>Bringing the importance of community to the forefront, 8 by YOOX spotlights two creatives and their tight-knit support systems in a new two-part video series. They are Boo Johnson and Deba, a pair of individuals who represent unapologetic authenticity in their respective fields. The films celebrate the launch of the SS22 8 by YOOX collection, which puts comfort and individuality first by providing elevated wardrobe staples with a twist. </span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-brightcove" data-id="6307759731112"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="//players.brightcove.net/5972928229001/caIGZ7r8z_default/index.html?videoId=6307759731112" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>For Deba, a model and activist who uses her unique looks and voice as a tool for changing the world, her story of togetherness celebrates sisterhood in various forms. She sees friendship and supportive relationships as essential in growing as a person. “Sisterhood to me is being able to have a group of people that you can really really just trust with your whole life,” the Dazed 100 alumni says. </span></p>
<p><span>Deba’s closest circle, seen in the film, includes India, Maxine, T, and Sally, all of whom bring out the best in each other’s personalities.  “We’re here to help each other get through life, pick each other up, motivate each other… I like to remind my friends that they are great because we don't hear enough of it. And sometimes, you just need to hear that – you're doing well, you're doing good,” Deba shares. </span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-brightcove" data-id="6307760331112"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="//players.brightcove.net/5972928229001/caIGZ7r8z_default/index.html?videoId=6307760331112" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><span>Skater and entrepreneur Boo Johnson connects with people who share his love and passion for the art of skating. “You got people from around the world that connect just from a skateboard. And everyone has different styles, everyone approaches skating in a different way,” he explains. Joined by friends Gabriel, George, and Josh</span><span> </span><span>at his local park, the group are outfitted in key pieces from SS22 8 by YOOX. The sleeveless leather vest, nylon bomber, and oversized hoodies look right at home on the pipe. </span></p>
<p><span>But for Boo, it’s not just about building close ties with those people. Sometimes, the community feel comes through embracing the spontaneity that emerges out of his daily routines. “I like hanging out with random people – hearing their stories, inspiring others and just being a person who lives in this beautiful chaotic world,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span>By showing snippets of two unique groups of creatives, the films hammer down on the importance of human connection and cultivating a group of friends that will be there with you, no matter what. It’s the chosen family that counts.</span></p>]]>

	</figure>
<p><span><a href="http://www.williamgannonart.com/">William Gannon</a> began working as a community artist around the end of the 1970s, travelling up and down the country with a group of other artists in a transit van, to create art with disadvantaged kids and vulnerable communities. “From that I learnt my one guiding principle,” he tells Dazed. “Which is that to create relevant art we have to use what we have got.” Often, this meant relying on spray paint as a cheap and accessible tool for making art. “Tags and throw-ups were a powerful way to cover a lot of ugly urban space, and stencils were a way for everyone to take part because they made image making easy.”</span></p>
<p><span>Decades later, however, in 2022, Gannon’s preference for spray painting stencils has had an unanticipated effect, drawing accusations that he’s actually the super secret street artist <a href="/banksy">Banksy</a>. Of course, these kinds of claims are nothing new. One week Banksy </span><a href="/music/article/32710/1/robert-del-naja-says-he-s-not-banksy"><span>is Robert ‘3D’ Del Naja</span></a><span> of Massive Attack, the next he’s </span><a href="/art-photography/article/50414/1/is-neil-buchanan-actually-banksy-an-expert-weighs-in"><span>that presenter from </span><em><span>Art Attack</span></em></a><span>. (Everyone denies it, but Banksy </span><em><span>would </span></em><span>deny it, wouldn’t he?) The difference is, Gannon has been forced to resign from his post on the town council of Pembroke Dock, Wales – where he moved “to begin easing into retirement” – under the weight of the allegations.</span></p>
<p><span>According to Gannon, the Banksy accusations are part of a broader campaign of targeted harassment. In a timeline of the controversy, he says that the harassment started in January 2022, when someone entered his studio space and took unauthorised pictures of his work.</span></p><p><span>“They later contacted me by phone to tell me that they ‘knew what I was up to’ in the studio,” he says, adding that he went on to become the target of coordinated social media attacks and IRL stalking. Emails were also sent to the Pembroke Dock town council, alleging that he’d changed his name several times, to distance himself from his former life as “a notorious vandal in Bristol and London” – AKA Banksy. Gannon finally announced he was stepping down late last month, explaining in a resignation letter that he feared for the reputation of the council.</span></p>
<p><span>So far this sounds like the sad, simple tale of a man whose retirement has been ruined by the Banksy conspiracy machine. However, Gannon isn’t giving up so easily. “I joined the council to fight injustices and give something back to the people who had welcomed me into this community,” he says. “Not being on the council means that I am going to have to fight back using art instead.”  </span></p>
<p><span>So far, this has involved producing 999 badges that bluntly address the rumours – in white text on a black background, they read: “I Am Not Banksy” – which Gannon distributed among the people of Pembroke Dock. The idea? If everyone in the world who isn’t Banksy wears an “I Am Not Banksy” badge, then the identity of the real Banksy will be exposed. Admittedly, this places a lot of faith in Banksy’s honesty, and Gannon’s ability to mass-produce almost 8 billion badges. Really, it’s more about the broader concept, he says: “Finding Banksy is about keeping it real. I hope to illustrate the absurdity of trying to find a mythical figure.”</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>You might be wondering at this point, what does Gannon think of Banksy himself? Is he flattered by the idea that he’s secretly the </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/26/banksy-balloon-girl-hay-wain-favourite-uk-work-of-art-constable-poll-nation"><span>nation’s favourite artist</span></a><span>? To answer the latter: not really, but it’s not Banksy’s fault. “In a country where the rich are becoming obscenely richer, while the poor are increasingly having to choose between heating their homes, paying the rent, or feeding their kids, the commodification of art left most of us with little or no access to it,” he says. “Banksy challenged that by putting the art where the people were, for them to enjoy, and making it about their lives.”</span></p>
<p><span>What the allegations against him have exposed, Gannon goes on, is the lingering idea that art is only made by a select group of celebrity artists: “If you are a street artist you MUST be Banksy, because Banksy is the ONLY street artist that there has ever been.” This plays into the myth of the “white male individual genius” that is used to commodify a once-egalitarian art form, he adds – a myth that has seen Banksy’s artworks </span><a href="/art-photography/article/54512/1/banksy-self-destructing-artwork-love-is-in-the-bin-breaks-record-18-6-million"><span>rake in millions</span></a><span> at auction in the last few years.</span></p>
<p><span>“For that reason, I am not flattered by the mis-identification, because it reveals the increasing cultural poverty of a society that diminishes the non-celebrity artists in order to promote the ‘elite’ and the commodification of our culture,” says Gannon. “In the UK, money is the only thing that matters, so the only artists that matter are the ones making money. That is culturally poisonous, and I refuse to play that game.”</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>The campaign that claims the real Banksy is hiding in plain sight in Pembroke Dock isn’t the only Welsh controversy connected to the artist in recent years. An actual Banksy stencil titled </span><em><span>Season’s Greetings </span></em><a href="/art-photography/article/42658/1/new-banksy-wales-port-talbot"><span>popped up</span></a><span> in Port Talbot back in 2019, leading the unsuspecting owner of the shed it was painted on to deal with huge crowds and vandals. The owner eventually managed to get if off his hands </span><a href="/art-photography/article/42974/1/new-banksy-artwork-seasons-greetings-sold-for-six-figure-sum-port-talbot"><span>for a six-figure sum</span></a><span>, but even then a local </span><a href="/art-photography/article/55182/1/a-banksy-fan-sentenced-destroy-500000-artwork-seasons-greetings-port-talbot"><span>tried to break in</span></a><span> and destroy the artwork, to protest it moving out of Wales.</span></p>
<p><span>Again, Gannon notes, this controversy wasn’t caused by Banksy himself (although you’d think the artist could predict the reaction to his public artworks by now), but by its commodification. “</span><span>It was only when money became involved that things got nasty,” he says. “Suddenly it was bought, and then moved out of the town. Where is it now? Sitting in a freeport shipping container or bank vault as a commodity, accumulating monetary value as far away as possible from the people for whom it was intended?”</span></p>
<p><span>Now that Gannon has left the town council, he also intends to get back to making art for the people of his hometown and others like it. Beyond the “I Am Not Banksy” project, he has plans for sculptures that explore the link between consumerism and animal welfare. </span></p>
<p><span>“I have been jolted out of my early easing into retirement,” he says. “The universe has grabbed me by the scruff of my neck as I tried to make my way peacefully down the centre of the road, and shaken me until the bones I relied upon to hold me up snapped. With my old form broken I am already feeling for my new shape to get back on track.”</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="f-QehN04WcE"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f-QehN04WcE" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div>]]>

<p><span>There is a tendency within fashion to talk about graduate talent as if it were to begin and end with </span><a href="/tag/central-saint-martins"><span>Central Saint Martins</span></a><span>. The reality, of course, is that there are hundreds of fashion schools beyond the Watford Gap that are producing just as many stars. One college that has garnered significant interest over recent years is the University of Aalto, which has become a honeypot for madcap confectionery, nestled in the outskirts of Helsinki. Bathed in approximately 19 hours of sunlight during the summer, the university’s arts building is plastered with makeshift banners and placards, protesting the kind of funding cuts that have become endemic to creative institutions around the world. “Give back our spaces,” one reads. “We create value not profit,” says another. </span><span></span></p><p><span>The cohort’s calls for “actual artistic practice and meaningful academic knowledge” are embodied not only in this year’s final collections, but in the invention of a skew-eyed, all-consuming bear which has been placed at the entrance of the design studios. Inside, equally buck-wild creations hang from rails, some quite terrifying in their raw and rough-hewn qualities, while others have been overblown to boisterous and cartoonish proportions. And at the end of each rack is a designer, each of whom mirrors their collection in a way that feels quite heart-warming, as if they have grown together in perfect symbiosis. Take <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tuplat/">Tuuli-Tytti Koivula</a>, for example, who is presenting her hyperactive approach to skiwear with pastel pink hair and child-like eyeshadow, or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/201rises/?hl=en">Iiris Kamari</a>, who looks like a mix between a haunted chambermaid and Rick Owens, all smudged lipstick and straggly hair, and her ghostly, body-baring take on party girls. </span></p>
<p><span>As the fashion crowd in Helsinki are often quick to note, almost every major label has at least one Finnish person working on its design team, and it’s soon clear why. Below, we take a closer look at five of the graduate students rising from the University of Aalto and their boundary-pushing offerings.</span></p><h1><span>TUULI-TYTTI KOIVULA </span></h1>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>“</span><span>This collection explores how two different cultures can coexist peacefully and create value. I witnessed this phenomenon while visiting small Alpine-villages for ski training. With international teams competing in glaciers, I saw how the traditional culture had become mixed-up with ski racing. Farmers drink alongside foreign skiing coaches in quaint little pubs. Athletes train in a field next to cows, while all the ski centre employees would work the land during summer seasons. But the glaciers are melting and shrinking year by year, and at one point I saw flowers growing through the snow. I wanted to encapsulate that bittersweet image in my prints, many of which follow slalom zigzag shapes. I’ve blended inspirations from ski racing gear and the Bregenzerwalds’ traditional costume, Juppe, using embroidered fabrics and hand-knitting. These are clothes for women visiting Blumenthal, sketching flowers in their diary, and ending up in apres ski.”</span></p>

<p><span>“Hot, sexy, and everything cute. These were the ingredients I chose to create the perfect Megababe. But who are these glamorous, gorgeous people? Well, Megababes came from my own experience growing up in a working-class environment, being influenced by pop culture phenomenons, superstars, television, and the pre-internet celebrity. I dove into the roots of my persona, to my earliest memories, searching for that child’s curiosity to find the courage to experiment with bright, loud materials, while moving my mother’s and grandmother’s handcraft lessons into this generation. As a child, I had to build my world around myself from toys that I had either collected or made myself. This collection really is the same, full of hand-knitted and crocheted pieces, building a world from the vestiges of the past – from the trash, recycling centres, and my own friends. Eeek! Hot and famous MegaBabes are coming, watch out!!”</span></p>

<p><span>“Titled </span><span><em>Party Girls</em>, this collection illustrates an intermingling of seven party girls, taking cues from Pina Bausch’s </span><em><span>Die Klage Der Kaiserin</span></em><span>. My methods include working with found materials and replicas, deconstructing the traditional party dress and its form, revealing the body in various states of undress, using draping and couture finishings. Each piece is likely to change over time due to the kind of reinforcements used and the nature of the materials, including acetates and lots of natural fibres. At the heart of the collection is collaboration, from the conversations I had with my friends throughout the process to the production of wigs and shoes which I made with an atelier of close colleagues.”</span></p>

<p><span>“My collection is a queer-feminist depiction of Finnish witchcraft. Each look is a non-male character from Finnish mythology, embodying five characters: Louhi is the goddess of the underworld and the mother of diseases, who got impregnated by the wind; Kiputyttö collects the pains of the people on pain mountain; Vellamo is the goddess of water; Kaveh is a mysterious non-binary creature of the forest; and Syöjätär eats cis-men who get lost in the forest. All pieces are made of abandoned materials that I have collected from second hand shops throughout the year – I like the idea that the history and the energy of these materials are somehow intertwined with the collection. My approach to fashion is like textile sculpting, feeling the nature and energy of the material, hand-knitting, wet-felting, and needle-felting pictures, text, and three-dimensional shapes together. My way of working is very intuitive, physical, and performative. I start all my clothes blindfolded, feeling my way through the visual world and atmosphere I want to create. I let the movement of my body and the materials lead the process.”</span></p>

<p><span>“This is all about Finnish car culture. The idea first came to me while I was driving home from the  countryside. Having gone for several hours straight, I started to feel like I was melting into the road and becoming one with the car. I started to see the asphalt as a long sheet of dark denim. Most of my research concentrates on car-tuning and kortteliralli (AKA cruising) and the people who inhabit those worlds. I sourced materials from Instagram and online forums like IRC-Galleria, taking pictures on the street and inside parking garages. I’ve drawn as much inspiration from the people as I have their cars. The most important design method for me was acquiring actual car stuff and playing with it. For example, I transformed a couple of car benches into garments and a car cover into a dress. I really see cars as a self-expression tool. A car, much like clothes, serves as a human’s outer shell. Only here, I’ve mixed elements of the driver and the  driver’s vehicle into one.”</span></p>]]>

<p><span>The first flight deporting asylum seekers to Rwanda was </span><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-61806383"><span>cancelled</span></a><span> yesterday, just minutes before it was due to take off. This came following a legal ruling on Tuesday evening and </span><a href="/politics/article/56314/1/protests-erupt-in-london-ahead-of-first-rwanda-deportation"><span>months of protests</span></a><span>.</span><span></span></p>
<p><span>Prior to the cancellation, seven people were due to be deported, which was already a dramatic drop from the initial figure of 130. But a last-minute intervention from the EHRC (European Court of Human Rights), citing “the risk of inhuman and degrading treatment,” stopped the flight. </span></p>
<p><span>Announced in April, the Rwanda asylum plan aims to give refugees a one-way ticket to the East African country, with the wider ambition of deterring migrants from travelling to the UK. Ever since then, the scheme has been met with heated backlash and weeks of fervent campaigning. For everyone involved in these efforts, yesterday’s cancellation is a huge win. NGO Freedom from Torture </span><a href="https://twitter.com/FreefromTorture/status/1536818394024009729?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"><span>tweeted</span></a><span>, “WE did this together! From protests on the streets, to ppl chipping into legal cases, to 1000s of emails and calls. We know the govt won’t be giving up. So let’s give this everything we’ve got, starting now. Together we can win.”</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">BREAKING: Last ticket cancelled.<br><br>NO ONE IS GOING TO RWANDA</p>mdash; Care4Calais (@Care4Calais) <a href="https://twitter.com/Care4Calais/status/1536818146128150528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2022</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p><span>While the cancellation is great news, the fight isn’t over yet. Certainly, the government seems determined to press ahead: secretary Priti Patel declared herself “<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/first-deportation-flight-to-rwanda-halted-after-last-minute-legal-appeals-home-office-confirms-12634130">disappointed</a>” but added that the government “will not be deterred from doing the right thing and delivering our plans to control our nation's borders”.  </span></p>
<p><span>The government already plans to appeal against the EHRC ruling, with Tory cabinet minister Therese Coffey saying she’s “<a href="https://news.sky.com/story/ministers-to-appeal-against-rwanda-ruling-and-highly-confident-next-flight-will-go-ahead-12634212">highly confident”</a> the next flight will go ahead. The coming months will likely see a protracted battle between the Tories and the expansive coalition of people committed to opposing the plan. If you’d like to get involved with this movement, activist network Solidarity Knows No Borders have organised a <a href="https://firmcharter.org.uk/week-of-action/">Week of Action</a>, with events taking place up and down the country this week.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>There are not many people who can take on the role of the universe. But if anyone can, it’s <a href="/tag/marina-abramovic">Marina Abramović</a>. The performance artist’s latest role sees her team up with New York dream-pop band Sound of Ceres for an interstellar adventure to the far corners of the universe. </span><em><span>Emerald Sea</span></em><span>, the band’s upcoming third album, sees Abramović and lead vocalist k engage in a cosmic dialogue between two deities, the universe and Venus, to tell the story of how existence came to know itself. </span></p>
<p><span>Stretched across three acts – The Void, The Deep, The Firmament – the album, and its accompanying visuals, is a fever dream of fierce orchestral passages and 80s-era Lynchian set design; a metaphysical tumble into the very core of our existence via Gustav Holst's </span><em><span>The Planets</span></em><span>, and Les Baxter's midcentury exotica </span><em><span>Emerald Sea</span></em><span>. As Abramović puts it: “The main question isn’t just ‘what is the cosmos’ but ‘what is behind the cosmos’.”</span></p><p><span>Abramović first met the band after attending one of their performances during a 2017 Brooklyn residency. </span><span>“My attraction to Sound of Ceres comes from the fact that the music feels so galactic – from a very part of the universe,”</span><span> she explains. By exploring the relationship between humanity and the cosmos, k – whose own alienoid features merge seamlessly into the record’s trippy aesthetic – explores the meaning of intimacy, both personal and cosmological, fleeting and eternal.</span></p>
<p><span>Below, the performance artist and dream pop experimentalist expand on their joint project, turning their attention to the cosmos – talking aliens, black holes and the meaning of existence.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="XnCrpym_14g"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XnCrpym_14g" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>How did this collaboration come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović:</strong><span> My partner is so passionate about music. He always wants to show me some new things. I come from a very classical music background. I was brought up on Mozart and Beethoven. I didn‘t even know what the Rolling Stones was until I was 30 years old. Because I left Yugoslavia at 29, I wasn’t interested in any of this type of music. But then, slowly, I started to include much more interesting types of music. But again, it was tribes and aborigine music, Zulu or Chavela Vargas from Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span>Then, I went to Alphaville for a residency and saw the Sound of Ceres, and I was totally captured for many reasons. What I saw there was captivating, it was so different. </span></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>We met at a residency that we were doing in Brooklyn at a dive bar in 2018. Someone as powerful as Marina is the last person we expected to show up at this location we were playing. But I remember she stood right in front of me as I was performing, literally feet away, and stared at me the whole time. I think most people might find that intimidating, but I actually found it super inspirational; a warm, calming presence. After that, I remember her telling me to never blink, which makes sense for her to say as the master of being present with her audience. That really stuck with me. I‘ve obviously never forgotten that line.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović:</strong><span> Never blink!</span></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>Yes! Never blink. I‘ve tried to bring that into my performance and be more aware in general.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>I‘ve been reading Yukio Mishima's book, </span><em><span>Beautiful Star</span></em><span>, it‘s the first book that he wrote that actually deals with science fiction. And it‘s to do with the different planets and galaxies and an entire family. The father comes from Mars, the children come from Venus, and the mother from Ketu, which is only seen in Indian mythology. So they‘re all coming in differently and they‘re all talking about UFOs and strange objects that are visible to earth.</span></p>
<p><span>My favourite thing is that they hardly use any technology; it’s a telephone or battery lamp. You can see all the little dust particles floating in the air. I always imagine that these little particles of dust are actually planets coming from different galaxies, with all the aliens inside – but they‘re too small. The humans don’t see them, but I saw them. They’re parallel galaxies and the music is like this, too. It was very emotional – I wanted to know more about them.</span></p>
<p><strong>How did the dialogue between Venus and the universe come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong><span> My art allows me to occupy another realm and mythical world, making them tangible for myself and the receiver whether that‘s someone listening to the record or someone that‘s there at the live show watching it visually. We wanted to make that immersive experience that takes listeners and viewers into that land with us. It’s really important that we kind of can bring that parallel universe, but make it real, make it something that people can actually experience. And I think that was, to me what was most important to get across with this album and this concept, and this kind of project.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>It’s also the way you sing, the way your clothes look, your presence in front of the audience. Even in normal life, you really look alien to me. You look like you’re from a different planet. </span></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong><span> I feel the same way for you. You are a character that you‘ve brought to this world that is from a different place, and space and time. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“There’s always that kind of understanding that we are just the little dot universe on the outskirts of the Milky Way” – Marina Abramović</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>How did you design the costumes?</span></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>We have a very low budget. A lot of times the things that we use on stage, whether they‘re lights or props or costumes, are made from things that we found in thrift stores, or maybe even trash on the side of the curb. </span></p>
<p><span>Jacob, one of our bandmates, is the master costume designer. But he and I work together to create the different designs for the show. I think the costumes are more about how they reflect light and receive light. Light is definitely a big piece that plays in with the costumes, rather than just thinking of what looks beautiful. It‘s kind of how will the light interact with what we‘re wearing.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>This idea of low technology is not just the question of the money, but it‘s also a question of choice: you actually embrace it. The quality is more plus than minus because of the simplicity. I remember when I was a child in ex-Yugoslavia that only had a programme in the evening, maybe two movies and news, that was it. The rest of the time was a static picture and you could see particles of electricity on the screen. I was fascinated. It probably was my first introduction to meditation. Just looking at the particles and looking at the atoms of energy passing by. You have the same type of that kind of low technology, so I‘d say you should never use high technology, in my point of view. But is this something that you embrace?</span></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>So we did create a new live show than what you‘ve seen in the past, but it‘s still with incredibly low technology of what we’re both able to afford and that we both set up ourselves. What’s special about the band is that we all have the things that we’re good at – and, luckily for us, we have someone looking out for the visual aspect too. But we do all have a DIY mindset.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><strong>What attracted you to cosmology in the first place?</strong></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong><span> The idea of expansion, endlessness, eternity, the unknown is what attracts me to cosmology. The idea of the furthest reaches of human understanding that inspires our art. Our reaction to that inspiration is to make art that's inspired by those ideas in a fictional world. Since we don‘t know exactly everything about the universe, we have a lot of guesses. Bringing that into a fictional world allows me to put a romantic tint on reality. When we‘re performing live, or when someone's hearing our record, they will be able to experience all of that unknown in real time – and, hopefully, it will feel more real to them.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>This fascination about the cosmos always comes back to childhood. For me, the main question wasn’t just ‘what is the cosmos’ but ‘what is behind the cosmos’. When you ask this kind of question, your brain just collapses; you can‘t think that far. Then there’s black holes and black holes suck planets in. But what’s on the other side of it? How does it all function? When I was a child, I was thinking that we are all on a hill atop of a big, fat cosmis lady, and she’s kicking us around in her own will – and we can’t control anything. </span></p>
<p><span>As an artist, it’s really important to have a big picture rather than the small picture. I always like to see things universally and how they look in space and time. There’s always that kind of understanding that we are just the little dot universe on the outskirts of the Milky Way. Planet Earth is a tiny blue planet and the surrounding millions of stars and asteroids can crush us at any second and we all can disappear. That kind of feeling of polarity has always been with me that actually this could happen any minute – and all that we have is to live in the present.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“We think that we are superior as humans, and that we rule the cosmos, but that’s not true at all. We’re all part of the same universe” – Marina Abramović</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How do you see our relationship as humans to the galaxy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>Poor humans! What can we do? We can disappear at any second from this planet. That’s one thing that we should really learn. We think that we are superior as humans, and that we rule the cosmos, but that’s not true at all. We’re all part of the same universe. Everything is reliant on each other – even a butterfly. We have to understand and learn to be more humble.</span></p>
<p><strong>K:</strong><span> Yeah, I agree with that. Our relationship with the universe has to do with the fact that we’re made up of the same thing that the universe is made of. I think that’s the larger story of our album bio. And the concept of this record is the fact that we are the universe because we are made up of the same things that the universe is made up of. But we also have an awareness of it. And I believe that’s what makes the human perspective special, because we actually have consciousness, a highly functioning cognitive function, that we can really understand and be aware of the universe itself. </span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>But we actually understand that we don’t understand anything. We don’t even know how life began – we don’t know shit. </span></p>
<p><span>Another question: why did you choose my voice? I have a terrible Slavic accent and my English is so poor.</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>That‘s so interesting that you say that because we view your voice is like so powerful and iconic. But, basically, the band had a narrative that there were two characters travelling through space and time together, one of those characters being the actual Universe itself. I would play one of the characters. So then it came down to well, who is the voice of this other character that is, in fact, the universe and our mind jumped to Marina straightaway, because, Marina, you have defined a lot of the art world that we're now inhabiting. So your voice as the universe to us was incredibly fitting for the project.</span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>I am the universe!</span></p>
<p><strong>K: </strong><span>At the beginning of the album, there’s an innocence of the unknown. Then it moves into the physical world where, as Venus, I move around the Earth as a creative force in the physical world, changing and having impact as humans do. The final form of the human mind and heart is reaching your full potential. </span></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>For me, every death is a new beginning. It’s a loop going on; this deconstruction, reconstruction, destruction and new beginning. So it’s never dying. It's just changing the forms, changing the shapes. But that’s it. It's more like a dance with the universe.</span></p>
<p><strong>How does it feel to be the universe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marina Abramović: </strong><span>It‘s big shoes to fill. I enjoy this whole idea of being the universe. It’s just a moment in time, then next time, you‘re just dust and disappear. One day you’re the universe, the next day you’re a black hole.</span></p>

<p>If releasing a series about the perils of capitalism on a multi-million-pound streaming platform wasn’t already questionable enough, the creators of <a href="/tag/squid-game"><em>Squid Game</em></a> have announced a reality TV series edition of the dystopian drama, where <span>456 participants will compete for a chance to win a $4.56m cash prize – the largest lumpsum jackpot in the history of reality TV.</span></p>
<p>Following the <a href="/film-tv/article/56298/1/squid-game-s-creator-has-shared-spoilers-for-the-upcoming-season-two">announcement earlier this week</a> that Squid Game will be returning for a second season,<span> </span><em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em><span> will see 456 participants compete in a series of games inspired by the show. There won‘t be any </span>fatal consequences though, as participants who don’t win will simply return home empty-handed.</p><p>Netflix vice president Brandon Reigg said the reality series will draw on Dong-hyuk’s “captivating story and iconic imagery”, adding that the company was grateful for his support in developing <em>Squid Game: The Challenge.</em></p>
<p>While the idea of basing a reality show on a series that denounces the capitalist rat race seems like a bizarre, if not outright distasteful decision, it’s a no-brainer for <span><a href="/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>, which confirmed that Squid Game is one of its most-watched series ever.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s no official date for when season two will drop, though </span><span>Hwang <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/05/squid-game-season-2-awards-insider">previously estimated</a> it could arrive in 2023 or 2024. </span>Netflix is currently casting for its <em>Squid Game </em>reality TV series, inviting applications from around the world. The first round will feature English-language speakers and be filmed in the UK. You can find out more <a href="https://www.squidgamecasting.com/">here</a>.</p>]]>

<p><span>Working at the intersection of anime and pop culture, digital artist Oseanworld has collaborated with everyone from Offset to Trippie Redd. His glitched-out artworks, featuring 3D rendered stuffed animals and cutesy floating creatures, has earned him fans by the likes of <a href="/tag/kanye-west">Kanye West</a> – and he’s showing no signs of slowing down.</span></p>
<p><span>Now, the 25-year-old is joining forces with metaverse platform REALM to launch Nu Radio, a blockchain-powered metaverse space imagined by Oseanworld. Set against the pixellated backdrop of candy-coloured vistas, and a towering Mad Monkeii (one of Oceanworld’s signature characters), players</span><span> can socialise, discover quests and Nu Radio racing; a multiplayer racing game complete with prizes and custom Oseanworld avatars with unique accessories that can be won or purchased in Nu Radio.</span></p>
<p><span>“I want to explore, I want to see a different world and I want to share that with my friends in as many ways as possible,” said Oceanworld. “ I wanted to build a game that allows you to feel free with everyone. And become completely unique in a world behind a screen.”</span></p><p><span>With its official launch slated for June 21, REALM – dubbed ‘the people’s metaverse’ – brings together AR, VR and mixed reality to bring forth immersive worlds where creators and brands can build communities via the quest builder, add gamification layers like event ticketing, live audio, and 3D sound, which users can access via digital portals.</span></p>
<p>Coinciding with the release, <span>Nu Radio</span><span> will be showcased between June 21 and 22 at NFT.NYC, an NFT event in New York, and will be </span><span>available on iOS and android, with PC and VR versions to follow. </span></p>
<p>If you don’t want to wait that long, a <span>Nu Radio</span><span>-themed pop-up will take place in New York’s Elizabeth Street. Attendees can take part in an Augmented Reality scavenger hunt, featuring a </span><span>trippy neon arcade where fans and media will get a first chance to explore Oseanworld’s latest adventure, win prizes from his digital and physical clothing and accessories collections.</span></p>

<p><span>Most of us will have tried to wrangle a dodgy return to ASOS before, but the stakes are a little higher when you’re dealing with what has been dubbed “the most famous dress in the world.” It is no exaggeration to say that the crystal-adorned gown is one of the most iconic garments in American history: Monroe was wearing it when she famously sang “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH3oOVKt0WI"><span>Happy Birthday</span></a><span>” to President John F Kennedy in 1962. </span></p><p><span>Following its reappearance at the Met Gala, it was returned to its home at Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, which is where the trouble began: Monroe expert and collector Scott Fortner posted before-and-after photos online which appear to show extensive damage, including stretched fabric and missing crystals.

<p><span>Fortner has argued that Ripley’s had been irresponsible in lending out the dress, and motivated more by a desire for publicity that its responsibilities towards historical preservation.The gown was first acquired by the museum in 2016 for $4.8million and is normally kept in a darkened and tightly temperature-controlled vault, which does make the decision to send it out to on the red carpet  – to be subjected to thousands of flashing cameras - seems irresponsible. </span></p>
<p><span>It’s true that Kardashian only wore the dressed for 20 minutes before changing into a replica, but then what is even really the point? Why not just wear a replica to begin with? She could probably have had one made that actually fit, </span><a href="https://www.yourtango.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-coat-hide-couldnt-fit-marilyn-monroe-dress-fans-say"><span>unlike the Monroe dress</span></a><span>.</span></p><blockquote>
<p><span>”This is not just a dress. This is a cultural icon. It's a political icon. It's a Hollywood icon. It's part of American history from an event that happened 60 years ago and… it should have been archived and preserved and taken care of” – Scott Fortner</span></p>
</blockquote><p><span>“I think the disappointment that I'm experiencing is Ripley’s has made multiple statements that they were doing everything that they could to protect and preserve the gown,” Fortner said.”I do feel that it [was] irresponsible, this is not just a dress. This is a cultural icon. It's a political icon. It's a Hollywood icon. It's part of American history from an event that happened 60 years ago and… it should have been archived and preserved and taken care of.”</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><span>While Fortner stated that it wasn’t his intention for outrage to be directed at Kardashian, the star has faced considerable backlash on social media for borrowing the dress in the first place. Doing so was certainly a mistake, but given she’s not an archivist or collector, perhaps a forgivable one – the more salient point is that she shouldn’t have been allowed to. It betrays a lack of respect for fashion history and the vital preservation work which upholds it, for one thing.</span></p>
<p><span>For Kardashian’s part, she has </span><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kim-kardashian-accused-returning-marilyn-27225803"><span>denied</span></a> r<span>eturning the gown in poor condition and claimed that it was already exhibiting signs of wear-and-tear. Her social media vilification also provides an echo of the life of Monroe, who was widely disparaged throughout her life and only achieved beloved icon status posthumously. Who knows what Kardashian dresses we’ll be arguing about in 60 years time?</span></p>]]>

<p><span>On the morning of Saturday June 11, neighbours in southeast London came together to stop an immigration raid in a Peckham estate. At first, it was just a dozen of us locking arms and one person laying in front of the van, to stop it from leaving. Within hours our community showed up in the hundreds, outnumbering cops and immigration officers. As we sat in the sun chanting “let him go” the message to this government was clear: we won’t stand by while our neighbours are locked up, or sent to Rwanda.</span></p>
<p><span>The Home Office released a statement on Saturday evening saying we can’t stop deportations – but our action on Saturday shows that when we come together, we’re stronger than them.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://twitter.com/lewisham_ar?lang=en-GB">Lewisham Anti-Raids</a> is a group of south Londoners building community resistance against immigration raids. Many of us are migrants ourselves or the children of immigrants. We believe that the border system is cruel and inhumane, and that people’s rights should not depend on a piece of paper. We are anti-racist, anti-detention and anti-deportations. And we are not alone: </span><a href="https://antiraids.net/about/"><span>Anti-Raids networks</span></a><span> exist all over the country. We let each other know when immigration officers are in the area and we spread knowledge of what we can all do to stop raids from taking place. </span><span>Our message is clear: people who live here belong here.</span></p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p><span>Organising locally means building strong networks with business owners and residents, in person and online. We let people know what their rights are if they are harassed by immigration officers and we share information of local raids through social media.</span></p>
<p><span>Saturday’s beautiful resistance might seem like a drop in the ocean but it successfully challenged the Home Office and prevented someone from being detained. For us, the best way of resisting the Government’s migration policy is by building independent networks of solidarity and by challenging their ideas and actions visibly, everywhere, all the time. It tells the government we won’t accept their cruel and racist policies. Those of us who came together on Saturday were just locals living in and around Peckham - but we showed that we have the power to challenge immigration officers and protect one another, wherever they go.</span></p>
<p><span>We know that this government’s hostile immigration system is hurting our communities, and putting lives at risk. We won’t stand for it. That’s why, as this government ramps up its cruel policies, we’re ramping up our resistance to this country’s cruel borders.</span></p><h1><span>HOW CAN YOU HELP? </span></h1>
<p><span>This week marks the 10-year anniversary of the government’s (official) Hostile Environment policy. As part of the </span><a href="https://firmcharter.org.uk/week-of-action/"><span>‘Solidarity Knows No Borders’ week of action</span></a><span>, groups up and down the country are running </span><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/carnival-of-resistance-migrants-rise-against-the-hostile-environment-tickets-333498441817"><span>trainings</span></a><span> on how to resist raids. Get involved!</span></p>
<p><span>We know there is an ocean of injustice and we hope to contribute by being a small drop of resistance within it. </span><span>We know the struggles of migrants entering Europe do not end once you’ve crossed the border, as we are often faced with legal challenges or forced to work in exploitative conditions. </span><span>To build a better, more just Europe for all, regardless of nationality, you can support groups like Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants (LGSM), <a href="http://www.docsnotcops.co.uk">Docs Not Cops</a> (a group fighting for migrants’ access to health care</span><span>) or volunteer for a local charity like <a href="https://www.slr-a.org.uk">South London Refugee Association</a></span><span> or </span><span>donate to rescue and solidarity initiatives in the Mediterranean, like <a href="https://www.openarms.es/en/our-missions/mediterranean.">Operation Open Arms</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>We also know that low-wage workers, many of whom are migrants, have been fighting back against exploitation and organising in the UK. Unions like the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and United Voices of the World (UVW) have been taking the fight to the bosses. Every organised workplace is a step forward and a living example of the power we have when we stick together.</span></p>

<p><span>The government recently announced a new asylum policy that will <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-61782866">deport refugees arriving in the UK to Rwanda</a>. While initially announced as a plan to “offshore” people there for “processing”, it quickly became clear that this would be a one-way ticket.</span></p>
<p><span>This is a cruel and inhumane plan for a number of reasons. For a start, it’s a way of the UK abdicating its responsibility towards refugees, and will further compound the suffering of people who have already suffered a great deal. The refugees being deported to Rwanda have been chosen randomly, regardless of the strength of their claims or the extent to which they’ve been persecuted, or whether they have any connection to people smuggling whatsoever (the latter point being one of the government’s justifications of the policy). It’s also a way for the Tories to shore up support and embolden the worst elements of its base: as Labour MP </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zarahsultana/status/1536427557712711681?s=20amp;t=YZSyytHiII1G_o7qlh9_5g"><span>Zarah Sultana</span></a><span> tweeted, “deporting refugees to Rwanda has nothing to do with tackling people-trafficking and *everything* to do with whipping-up hate and stoking division.” Already, “we should send you to Rwanda” is emerging as a </span><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rwanda-racist-slur-social-media-b2100529.html"><span>new racial slur</span></a><span>. It’s clear that the plan is a vindication of everything that is cruel and racist about Britain.</span></p><p><span>Unsurprisingly, the plan has been met with a huge backlash, which has been partially successful in mitigating the effects. An initial 130 people were facing deportation, but this figure has now dropped dramatically to single digits. The fate of the rest is still up in the air, with some observers optimistic that the government might end up sending an empty plane. </span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday (June 13), thousands turned up to the Home Office to protest the scheme. The demonstration, which was organised by <a href="https://www.migrantsorganise.org/">Migrants Organise</a> in coalition with groups like SOAS Detainee Support and the Solidarity Knows No Borders Network, saw a strong turn-out. There was a range of speakers and a speech read out by a group of dissident Home Office staff who oppose the measure (which wasn’t met with an entirely positive </span><a href="https://twitter.com/mlothianmclean/status/1536396921400590336?s=21amp;t=7Zg2sAjTGdNChpFCBMlo4g"><span>reaction</span></a><span> from the crowd).</span></p>
<p><span>“I think the protest showed how strongly people from all across the political spectrum feel about stopping these deportation flights,” says Migrants Organise’s Maymuna Osman. While the Rwanda plan is a particularly vicious and extreme example of government cruelty, it’s important to stress that it’s not a one-off, isolated act. “It’s an extension of a hostile environment against migrants which has existed and been embedded in policy for ten years. But it’s also building on the legacy of colonialism. This is something which racialised communities have had to resist for many, many years, and will continue to resist.” The government is also arguing that there’s no alternative to this policy, which is clearly absurd. “Obviously there’s an alternative,” Osman says. “Violent borders don’t exist for everyone.”</span></p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>One of the most striking aspects of the response to the Rwanda plan is the widespread, non-partisan backlash it has inspired. Along with the human rights groups and left-leaning politicians who you might expect, the entire Church of England leadership has condemned the measures, a </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/inhumane-the-tory-critics-of-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda"><span>small number</span></a><span> of Conservative MPs have attacked the plan, and even Prince Charles has </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/fdb02c86-e8ef-11ec-9b02-3f136f233710?shareToken=d563323dbfaf54ada8db03d03267da52"><span>allegedly </span></a><span>described the measure as “appalling” – albeit in private. While the plan still, unfortunately, has its fair share of supporters, the outrage it has inspired is undeniable. This might be a cause for optimism: “we need as many tactics as possible if we're going to win, so everyone's welcome,” says Osman. But non-partisan support isn’t the most important factor at play. “What’s making us more optimistic is the bursts of resistance by ordinary people we’ve seen in our communities,” she says, citing Sunday’s successful anti-raid protest in Peckham, and other recent incidents like it in Dalston, Kensal Rise Glasgow and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span>“We’re seeing more and more people knowing their rights and feeling very strongly that actually, this is not okay and that our neighbours cannot just be kidnapped like this,” Osman says. Organisers have been working for a long time to build up these communities of resistance, and now these efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The widely publicised successes we have seen have had a mobilising effect: people are starting to realise that they can make a meaningful difference at a local level. Hopefully, this momentum will continue to grow, and we’ll see a snowball effect where more and more people feel empowered to stand up to immigration raids in their local areas.</span></p>
<p><span>“People are realising that we can withdraw our consent from this violent form of border enforcement and policing,” says Osman. Now more than ever, police officers are becoming involved in doing the job of border enforcement. This has always happened, to an extent, but it’s now taking place on a bigger scale. Challenging police power at a local level is extremely important, but there is still a place for the kinds of large protests outside the Home Office that we saw yesterday. “It has to be a combination,” says Osman. “Because for some people those big mobilisations are where they might then join an organisation, and have their moment of realisation that they can do something locally. Community organising always has to be the bread and butter. It takes time and it’s kind of countercultural in the society that we're living in, but it's always, always worth it. I think when we see the ramping up of hostility to our communities, we also see the fight back, with people coming together to protect their communities. That’s going to be crucial going forward, because we've got a fair few years of this government ahead.”</span></p>	<figure>

<p><span>When it comes to these anti-raid protests, it’s clear that they aren’t just the work of a random group of protesters parachuting down into communities. “You can’t argue with the numbers and you can’t argue with the fact that these are local people who feel strongly about this,” says Osman. “There are lawyers who are challenging the deportations on human rights grounds and getting people off the flights. But that wouldn't happen without this swell of public outcry; people not just talking about it, but willing to take action and put bodies on the line. And that's really powerful. In terms of our long-term organising, it’s important to give people that feeling of hope and community and the idea that when we come together collectively, we can do something.”</span></p>
<p><span>Whether or not this kind of grassroots mobilisation will be enough to make the Tories shelf their Rwanda asylum plan remains in doubt. “It does seem like the government is really wanting to push ahead with it – and even if there's one person on that flight, for us that’s one person too many. But they seem to be using it as a way to send a message; it's symbolic for them. They weren’t expecting this many people to feel so strongly and to actually speak out about it. And I think that has taken them by surprise,” says Osman.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re feeling angry about the deportations and would like to do something, you should check out ‘Solidarity Knows No Borders’, which is a loose coalition of different grassroots organisations and charities. They have come together to organise </span><a href="https://firmcharter.org.uk/week-of-action/"><span>Week of Action</span></a><span>, taking in over 50 events up and down the country. The hostile environment is a stain on this country and we all have a moral obligation to oppose it.</span></p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">KKW Beauty, Glossier and the beauty vibe shift</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Big changes at the two monoliths of 2010s beauty indicate that our priorities have shifted – and what is to come</h3>

	<figure>

	</figure>
<p><span>In the 2010s, beauty culture was defined by two archetypal make-up looks. There was the my-face-but-dewier, no-make-up make-up look packaged in millennial pink by Emily Weiss’s </span><a href="/beauty/glossier"><span>Glossier</span></a><span>. And then there was the ultra-glam, full-face, highlight-and-contour routine made mainstream by the inarguable icon of the decade, <a href="/beauty/tag/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>, which she then capitalised on with her eponymous make-up line KKW Beauty. </span></p>
<p><span>Both Glossier and KKW Beauty were paradigms of our newly digital culture. Launched in 2014, Glossier was the OG social-first beauty brand and immediately dominated the scene with its affordable, aesthetic products designed for #shelfies. In the early days of our online life, as our faces increasingly became the focus, Glossier made make-up accessible and taught us how to aesthetically curate our lives for the gram – right down to the bathroom shelf. Just five years later, it had reached unicorn status as a billion-dollar beauty brand.</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum, our beauty beats were becoming heavier than ever after Kardashian introduced the public to contouring in 2012. As the online world became saturated with faces, we needed a way to stand out in small squares, for our features to pop in pixels. Previously the secret of drag queens and pro make-up artists, a selfie showing Kardashian’s unblended contour went viral and the practice quickly became a regular step in many of our routines. In 2017, her beauty line launched with just one product: contour kits, designed to recreate her sculpted appearance. The KKW range soon expanded and b</span><span>y June 2020, Coty had acquired a 20 per cent stake in KKW Beauty for $200 million, valuing the business at a billion dollars.</span></p>
<p><span>But the 2010s are over and change is afoot in the beauty sphere. A vibe shift is coming. At the end of May, Weiss announced that she was stepping down as Glossier CEO, moving instead to the new role of executive chairwoman. A mere seven days later, Kardashian relaunched KKW Beauty as the renamed, rebranded and reimagined SKKN. What can it mean that the two beauty monoliths of the past decade are evolving, almost in perfect synchronicity?</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><span>The rebranding of KKW Beauty officially signals what we’ve known for a while: the era of highlight and contour is over. Just as we’ve come to expect from the Kardashians, however, a new season is always coming. The family is used to shapeshifting to reflect the trending ideals. Kim’s continual transformation and manipulation of her physical self has been key to her success, and the fall of KKW Beauty and the rise of SKKN is no different.</span></p>
<p><span>Unlike KKW, SKKN comprises no make-up and instead is focused on nine prestige (prices range from $43 to $95) skincare products. This shift is no surprise. During the pandemic, skincare reigned supreme as we focused on routines and rituals over excessive make-up application. Once lockdown lifted, the make-up of our pre-pandemic life felt too heavy, moving the focus to a ‘five-minute face’ or the ‘clean girl aesthetic’.</span></p>
<p><span>Ulta Beauty has highlighted this “faux-effortlessness” as a defining trend of 2022. “Faux” being the key word here, as </span><span>what the viral content fails to mention is that it’s an aesthetic only made possible by good genetics and expensive beauty work: braces, balayage, fake tan, lash extensions, brow waxing, filler, and the luxury of a dermatologist (a service not often offered on the NHS). The people who go viral typically have straight hair, clear skin, full brows, and are often young, wealthy, white (or light-skinned), thin, and conventionally attractive. </span></p>
<p><span>Ever keeping up with the trends, Kardashian’s SKKN products are </span><a href="https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-skkn-by-kim-review"><span>“clean”</span></a><span> and focused on “skinimalism”. She may have </span><a href="https://centennialbeauty.com/kim-kardashian-bbl-reversal-new-beauty-standards-body-skinny/"><span>reduced her BBL</span></a><span> and adopted a less overt beauty look but do not let that fool you into thinking her participation in beauty labour has diminished. To the </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/01/style/kim-kardashian-skkn-skin-care-line.html"><em><span>New York Times</span></em></a><span>, </span><span>Kardashian described all nine of the SKKN products as “necessary”. “I wanted to just stay true to exactly what I use, even if everyone was saying this is overwhelming,” she said.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>Once the defining beauty brand of an era, Glossier is instead facing a crossroads and needs to  adapt in order to survive. </span></p>
</blockquote><p><span>The nine-step lineup is said to mirror Kardashian’s own elaborate daily ‘ritual’. Of course, it doesn’t – no cream can replicate the years of laser, stem cell facials and PRP that she also mentions in the interview. </span><span>What SKKN actually represents is a further extension of the newly energised beauty industrial complex, one designed to sell the faces of our idols to the masses, and which is </span><a href="/beauty/head/article/55974/1/not-ugly-just-poor-how-the-beauty-industry-is-widening-the-class-divide"><span>increasingly becoming inaccessible</span></a><span> to most. </span></p>
<p><span>While Kardashian is capitalising on the clean girl, five-minute face aesthetic, it is Glossier that the origins of the look can be traced back to. So why is it not the biggest brand in the industry right now? </span></p>
<p><span>An influencer in her own right, Weiss launched Glossier from her hugely successful blog </span><a href="https://intothegloss.com/"><em><span>Into The Gloss</span></em></a><span> and has been a key face of the brand (and the wider #GirlBoss movement) ever since. For many, there is no Glossier without Weiss at the helm, so the news of her stepping down signals a shift regardless of the reasoning behind it. Weiss claims the move will suit her strengths, allowing her to continue steering the company’s future growth. </span><span>However, the announcement comes after a string of controversies and setbacks for the brand. </span></p>
<p><span>In August 2020, Glossier closed several of its stores before quietly discontinuing its Glossier Play line. Online, an anti-Glossier movement had begun, criticising the brand’s non-inclusive shade range and </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/outtathegloss/"><span>toxic workplace culture</span></a><span>. In 2021, Glossier’s US sales decreased by 26 per cent, and at the end of the year, just six months after raising $80m in funding, Glossier announced they were laying off a third of their staff. ‘</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/glossier/comments/scj297/is_glossier_in_its_flop_era/"><span>Is Glossier in its Flop Era?’</span></a><span> a Reddit thread asked earlier this year.</span></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-version="13" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/Cd8oh-XL00x/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
                </div>
<p><span>Many have suggested that the millennial consumer Glossier had become synonymous with had aged out of the brand, opting for a more elevated beauty experience from labels such as Nars and Charlotte Tilbury. Meanwhile, the dewy, minimal make-up look fell somewhat out of favour with younger beauty consumers following the arrival of </span><em><span>Euphoria</span></em><span> in 2019 and its maximalist, expressive and bejewelled aesthetic. Ironically, just six months before the HBO drama hit our screens Glossier had launched its Play range, a more creative and colourful line that aimed to capture Gen Z. It could be argued the range came just half a year too early. </span></p>
<p><span>Glossier’s two most recent launches signal an attempt to appeal to Gen Z once again. The brand has announced Olivia Rodrigo as their first-ever celebrity partner, while their latest product launch is a range of bold-coloured eyeliners (very </span><em><span>Euphoria</span></em><span>-esque). Significantly, the eyeliners are based on the Glossier Play Color Slide and also launch the brand’s new approach to shopping through its partnership with YouTube Short’s </span><a href="https://www.glossy.co/beauty/as-glossier-realigns-it-taps-youtubes-new-shoppable-shorts-challenge/"><span>new shoppable feature</span></a><span>. </span></p>
<p><span>The past few years have seen a slot-machine cycle of beauty trends – from indie sleaze to clean girl, painfully precise Euphoria glam to </span><a href="/head/article/55537/1/the-rise-of-anti-perfectionist-make-up-why-we-all-want-to-look-messy-now"><span>anti-trend anarchy</span></a><span>. As we re-align with self-expression post-pandemic and reconcile what make-up means in our new normal, the future currently feels like a liminal space, with no one brand, or aesthetic, taking the lead. Can Glossier carve out a space to cement themselves in our beauty futures? Only time will tell. </span></p>
<p><span>With Kardashian’s launch of SKKN, however, one trend set to define the next decade is clear. With botox and filler procedures </span><a href="https://www.isaps.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Global-Survey-2019.pdf"><span>rising rapidly</span></a><span> in both the UK and the USA, and with many consumers trying to </span><a href="/beauty/body/article/55987/1/the-women-getting-cosmetic-procedures-in-secret"><span>keep their beauty work a secret</span></a><span>, the next era of beauty culture looks to be a far more covert, insidious and expensive operation that once again, benefits those in a position of privilege. The beauty culture of the next decade will be defined by this invisible labour. A focus on anti-ageing, tweakments and surreptitious procedures designed to defy detection.</span></p>]]>

<p><span>By now, you’ve probably heard of DALL-E 2, and maybe you’ve spent hours lying awake at night, thinking about the inevitability of our obsolescence as machines gain powers beyond our comprehension. On the other hand, maybe you’ve spent hours lying awake at night plugging weird phrases into DALL-E’s search bar. </span><a href="https://twitter.com/octowasabi/status/1535354111083814917"><span>Nosferatu in RuPaul’s </span><em><span>Drag Race</span></em></a>.<span> </span><a href="https://twitter.com/standoom1/status/1534038867766087682"><span>Karl Marx in </span><em><span>Seinfeld</span></em></a>.<span> That kind of thing. If AI really can become sentient, like that one guy at Google </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jun/12/google-engineer-ai-bot-sentient-blake-lemoine"><span>says it can</span></a><span>, then why not have a bit of fun with it before it wipes us off the Earth, right?</span></p>
<p><span>For the uninitiated, DALL-E 2 is a novel AI system from the Elon Musk-founded research company OpenAI, which creates images based on users’ descriptions. A less sophisticated version created by AI enthusiast <a href="https://twitter.com/borisdayma">Boris Dayma</a>, dubbed DALL-E Mini, is available without the long waiting list. Inspired by programs that generate automatic captions for online images, these programs flip the script, scraping imagery from across the World Wide Web to illustrate whatever horrors your imagination can come up with. Admittedly, the DALL-E Mini results are usually pretty scuffed, like the “professional” </span><a href="/art-photography/article/41961/1/edmond-de-belamy-obvious-ai-artwork-auction-christies-robbie-barrat-opinion"><span>AI artworks</span></a><span> that came before them, but if you squint hard enough… yeah, it </span><em><span>does </span></em><span>kind of look like the Xenomorph from </span><em><span>Alien </span></em><span>in the style of Van Gogh.</span></p><p><span>Of course, art designed by artificial intelligence always raises fears about job losses in creative fields once considered a safe haven from the onward march of automation. As we mark another milestone in the fashion calendar, however – ICYMI, the SS23 menswear season </span><a href="/fashion/article/56305/1/london-fashion-week-men-ss23-ahluwalia-martine-rose-gay-spa-robyn-lynch-africa"><span>is a go</span></a><span> – human replacement by machines is looking increasingly tempting, even if it means trading in our future employment opportunities. Why waste our few remaining brain cells figuring out what Gucci is up to on the penultimate day of Milan fashion week, or how a </span><a href="/fashion/article/55326/1/all-hail-glenn-martens-jean-paul-gaultier-haute-couture-show-ss22"><span>post-Gaultier</span></a><span> Glenn Martens will top </span><a href="/fashion/article/55296/1/paris-fashion-week-trends-menswear-aw22-rick-owens-loewe-louis-vuitton-dior"><span>last season</span></a><span>’s Y/Project show, when we can get DALL-E Mini to do it for us?</span></p>
<p><span>Which brings us to the predictions below. With London’s SS23 menswear shows already fading in the rear view mirror, we asked DALL-E Mini to manifest some viral fashion moments, looks, and collaborations from the shows that haven’t happened yet. Think: yet more </span><a href="/fashion/article/55245/1/pra-daddies-jeff-goldblum-and-kyle-maclachlan-walked-the-prada-runway"><span>iconic casting choices</span></a><span> at <a href="/prada">Prada</a> this weekend, gem-studded </span><a href="/fashion/article/56154/1/gimp-mask-bdsm-latext-kink-fetish-gay-clothes-balenciaga-fashion-history-runway"><span>gimp masks</span></a><span> at Y/Project’s Paris show, and a very special guest closing the runway with <a href="/donatella-versace">Donatella Versace</a>.</span></p><h2><strong>LOEWE</strong></h2>	<figure>

<p><span>For AW22, <a href="/loewe">Loewe</a> <a href="/fashion/article/56068/1/hannibal-lecter-loewe-latest-muse-aw22-jonathan-anderson-campaign-juergen-teller">enlisted</a> Anthony Hopkins, the iconic face of cannibal killer Hannibal Lecter, to star in his first major fashion campaign. We asked DALL-E Mini what it would look like if </span><a href="/jw-anderson"><span>Jonathan Anderson</span></a><span> continued the theme for SS23, adopting </span><em><span>American Psycho</span></em><span>’s Patrick Bateman as his muse. The resulting collection offers a more conceptual take on the cannibal psychopath, leaning into Bateman’s big-fit 80s suiting. But wait… is the soft leather of that handbag folded to resemble human flesh? Is the model on the bottom row accessorising with a sickle? With Loewe tending toward high-concept looks and kitsch memes lately, it’s not out of the realm of possibility.</span></p>
<h2><span><strong>PRADA</strong></span></h2>	<figure>

<p><span>After <a href="/miuccia-prada">Miuccia</a> sent </span><span>Jeff Goldblum and Kyle MacLachlan down the runway for AW22, a decade on from Prada’s similarly DILF-filled AW12 show, Dazed <a href="/fashion/article/55339/1/prada-daddies-male-models-runway-cameo-miuccia-prada-celebrity-dilfs-oscar-isaac">speculated</a> that it could be Frank Ocean’s turn in another 10 years, having long been the face of the label. There’s no harm in getting started early, though, and DALL-E Mini already has a range of low-key looks lined up for the </span><em><span>Blonde </span></em><span>musician.</span></p>

After waiting a couple of minutes, it spat out the most appalling combination of reds and greens our eyes have ever seen. We’re not going to make you look at that, so then we tried something different. Still, there are traces of the beautiful game, via goalkeeper-green short shorts, shin-high socks, and tracksuit-esque outerwear.</span></p>

<p><span>In 2020, just as the world shut down due to the <a href="/tag/coronavirus">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, Kristin-Lee Moolman and Louise Ford were gearing up for their </span><em><span>28 Hats for Lamu</span></em><span> exhibition. This show featured photographs of participants of the Shela Hat Contest, a competition hosted in <a href="/tag/kenya">Kenya</a> every two years that sees inhabitants of Lamu, an island off the coast, create hats in response to the community’s growing ecological threats. Ford, a stylist who grew up in Zimbabwe and spent a lot of her childhood in Kenya, and Kristen-Lee Moolman, a South African photographer, began working to document the creativity of these contestants.</span></p>
<p><span>The resulting images would eventually become the focus of their </span><em><span>28 Hats for Lamu</span></em><span> exhibition, which was used to raise money for the New Leaf Rehabilitation Center in Lamu, a centre for those affected by drug addiction. While working on the show, Ford was introduced to Joan Otieno, an artist and the founder of Warembo Wasanii, an art workshop and studio space she founded in the slum of Korogocho in Nairobi. Otieno’s work and the community she has created piqued Ford’s interest. In no time, she and Moolman began drawing up plans for their collaboration featuring Otieno’s work. For two and a half years – the process was slowed down by the restrictions COVID-19 put on travelling, and meeting physically – Ford and Moolman worked tirelessly to document the community Otieno had created.</span></p><p><span>Similarly to their work on the <em>28 Hats for Lamu</em>, the duo photographed a set of artists in Nairobi, Kenya, but this time, the focus turned to the output of the women working with Otieno. For this particular project, Otieno and her students created a collection of costumes made entirely out of waste material collected from the nearby Dandora landfill. Produced and curated by Emmanuelle Atlan of Farago Projects and Sophie Strobel of ERE Foundation, these images are now going up in a multimedia exhibition titled <em>Mokoro</em>, on show at <a href="https://www.galerie-mercier.com/">Galerie Mercier et Associés</a> in Paris from June 23 to 25. Following that, they’ll be exhibited in Nairobi and finally be made available as a VR online exhibition space. </span></p>
<p><span>Here, Ford, Moolman and Strobele reveal more about how the project took form and what they hope it achieves.</span></p><p><strong>This project is sort of a continuation of the </strong><strong><em>28 Hats for Lamu</em> project you worked on – could you tell me what led to this exhibition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Louise Ford:</strong><span> I was sitting around a dinner table in Shela, Kenya in February 2020, waiting for Kristin-Lee to arrive to shoot </span><em><a href="https://1granary.com/fashion-image/28-hats-for-lamu-a-virtual-exhibition-about-environmental-empathy/">28 Hats For Lamu</a></em><span>. We were a collection of artists and journalists hosted by the competition’s founder. I was sat next to a friend and collaborator of Joan’s, Nyambura of </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/ubuni_fulamu/"><span>Ubunifu Lamu studio</span></a><span>. Nyambura told me about Joan and the girl’s project in Korogocho and I was full of awe and curiosity and showed Kristin-Lee Joan’s work the very next morning. She was equally enthused by the story, so we set our paths on meeting Joan and the girls, hatching a plan which would end up spanning two and a half years.</span></p>
<p><span>Mid-pandemic, the process was slow and we had to be patient for the right moment to travel. The project was finally made possible when we had the good fortune of meeting Sophie Strobele at one of her </span><a href="https://www.ere.earth/"><span>ERE Foundation</span></a><span> exhibitions in Paris. Sophie loved the Warembo Wassani spirit and couldn’t wait to come on board to curate an exhibition. Sophie partnered us up with Emmanuelle Atlan from </span><a href="http://www.farago-projects.com/"><span>Farago Projects</span></a><span>, also a curator and producer, who generously supported the project giving us the final backing we needed to ensure the girls and Joan were properly remunerated for their time. Thanks to Emmanuelle’s contacts in the fashion industry, we were able to meet </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yann_turchi/"><span>Yann Turchi</span></a><span>, the talented hairstylist who collaborated beautifully with the girls, creating unique sculptural hair looks. </span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>What is the collective hope for this exhibition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristin-Lee Moolman:</strong><span> Our hope is to celebrate the positive impact of Warembo Wasanii Initiative and the power women gain by supporting each other, as well as to create awareness of diverse communities in Africa. Hopefully, this can change any negative stereotypes associated with artists from the African continent.</span></p>
<p><strong>Louise Ford</strong><span>:</span><span> It’s been an interesting journey of learning for the whole team. We initially thought that a fundraiser and print sale would help support the studio and provide art supplies for the girls, but after partnering with the ERE Foundation and Farago, who had more experience on philanthropic projects, we realised that a longer-term plan needed to be set in place. Sophie put us in touch with Sabrina Herzog from the Ethical Fashion Initiative Nairobi, who provided valuable insight into the potential brand and craft collaborations for the girls, looking for ways in which their skill sets might be transformed into long-term employment opportunities and therefore financial autonomy. It was Joan’s idea to rent us the garments for our shoot at a fixed day rate rather than a one-off donation. Creating a goods-for-services transaction prepares the girls for future collaboration opportunities and also sets a fair standard for their hard work and self-worth. Our longest-term plan is to try and find ways to sponsor the girl’s further education at fashion and art schools in Nairobi. Something many of them dream of but is still too expensive. Perhaps our partnerships with the Alliance Française in Nairobi will open some doors in that direction. This is an ongoing effort and dialogue.</span></p>
<p><strong>What can people expect to see at the exhibition?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristin-Lee Moolman:</strong><span> A community of fledgling, teenage and grown boss bitches, a multimedia celebration of sisterhood and self-empowerment!</span></p>
<p><strong>Sophie </strong><strong>Strobele</strong><strong>: </strong><span>The show will allow you to experience our collaboration with the girls of Warembo Wasanii through the mesmerizing photographs of Kristin and the creative team, supported by video sequences of the girls and their surroundings, interviews with the students and artist of Warembo Wasanii and some of their surprising garments. I think people can expect to be pulled into a dream-like and at the same time powerful demonstration of sisterhood, creativity and solidarity.</span></p>	<figure>

<p><strong>What was the process of working on this like?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristin Moolman:</strong><span> The first step was connecting with Joan, we specifically wanted to commission everyone for the project and remunerate them fully for their time, so we asked for a quote from Joan who suggested we hire the dresses from the girls, as a way of empowering by recognising and celebrating their work.</span></p>
<p><span>We hit the ground running, met everyone and then decided why not shoot? The next few days were spent scouting and shooting with Yann on hair and the support of Sophie and Emanuelle, who interviewed the girls while we were shooting. We really got to know some of the girls who had been with Warembo for a long time, spending days in each other’s company. There was a real connection, rendering the camera invisible as opposed to a method of scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><strong>Sophie </strong><strong>Strobele</strong><strong>:</strong><span> Personally, I feel the strength of this project is how it doesn’t fit any category or creative process that people are maybe used to in the fashion industry. Just as Joan takes disposed materials and miraculously gives them a new context, we tried to take all the different ingredients and make something new, that breaks the codes. Even though Kristin and Louise came to us with the idea, they trusted us to add different layers and angles to the project. That’s how we ended up with a collaborative multimedia exhibit, bringing all different skill sets and opinions in one space. At ERE we always favour a collaborative, horizontal working process, which involves a lot of conversations, reassessments, listening and observing, which can sometimes be a bit overwhelming and emotional. But to me, it’s how you end up with something true and sincere. To me, the most important part of the process was going to Nairobi and plunging into the world of Joan and the girls for a few days, in order to best share their talent and story with our community here in Paris.</span></p>
<p><strong>What was different about shooting for <em>28 Hats for Lamu</em>?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kristen-Lee Moolman:</strong><span> COVID [laughs]. Kidding. Definitely, the garments created by the girls – their level of detail and innovation. The project is the spiritual successor to <em>28 Hats</em>, but more connected on a personal level, we had the luxury of time to work with the girls, as opposed to <em>28 Hats </em>where Louise and myself were so pressed for time. The other notable difference was the sanctuary and freedom within the walls of Warembo which provides a positive environment in which the girls and young women can thrive.</span></p>

<h1 class="fl-title">‘Bad bitch renaissance’: Watch the trailer for Issa Rae’s new Rap Sh!t</h1>

<p>Two estranged high school friends from Miami’s 305 set out to build a hip-hop career together after a boozy night out – or, at least, that’s the starting point for Issa Rae’s latest HBO comedy series <em>Rap Sh!t</em>.</p>
<p>Executive produced by Rae, who’s fresh off the back of her hit comedy-drama <em>Insecure</em>, the show stars Shawna (<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/aida-osman/" data-tag="aida-osman">Aida Osman</a>) and Mia (<a href="https://deadline.com/tag/kamillion/" data-tag="kamillion">KaMillion</a>), with Miami hip-hop duo City Girls as co-producers.</p>
<p>“We got the opportunity to have a good time, and win?” Mia tells Shawna over drinks as in the trailer. “We in the middle of a bad bitch renaissance.”</p><p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a39818691/first-look-hbo-rap-shit-cast-issa-rae-interview/"><em>Harper’s Bazaar,</em></a> Rae said <span>that<em> RAP SH!T </em>was born from her original<em> Insecure</em> script: ”I think this is just such a unique time in hip-hop, especially when it comes to female rappers, because there’s such an abundance, and it doesn’t feel like they’re all in competition with each other.”</span></p>
<p><span>“I’m a child of the 90s, and there used to always be a tendency to put two women against one another,” she added. “It feels like we’re in an era where there’s such a supportive environment now because of that abundance. All of that, combined with just my own story of coming up, became the next story that I wanted to tell.”</span></p>
<p><span><em>Rap Sh!t</em> will air a two-episode premiere on HBO Max on July 21, with following episodes airing weekly. Watch the trailer below.</span></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="xxp0Krp0pEg"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxp0Krp0pEg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div>]]>
