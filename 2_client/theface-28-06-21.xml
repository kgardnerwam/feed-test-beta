                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949827"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>Right before the start of Lockdown 1.0, I&nbsp;interviewed musician James Righton. The ex-Klaxons man, winner of the 2007 Mercury Prize for his former band’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>New Rave” debut <em>Myths of the Near Future</em>, was preparing to release his first album, the slinkily brilliant <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/65sFVv06f8yX72WtncFEZZ?si=SdCfwyOrQkWnuESYgAD_Ag&amp;dl_branch=1"><em>The Performer</em></a>, under his own name.</p><p dir="ltr">Going solo, he admitted that he’d feared being judged not on the merits or otherwise of his old group but on his wife: Keira Knightley. But the musician had concluded that <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>life is too short” to worry about any snarky comments from online dunderheads dismissing him as an A‑Lister Plus-One. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Literally, I&nbsp;just don’t give a&nbsp;shit as much anymore,” he said with a&nbsp;cheerful shrug. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I just make the stuff. I’m really good friends with this comedian Simon Amstell, and he’s like my therapist. He says: <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>You make stuff, you put it out and you have no control over anything else.’”</p><p dir="ltr">Eighteen months later, I’m sitting with this comedian Simon Amstell at (hopefully) the end of Lockdown 3.0. Aside from approving mention of Righton’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>sleazy, sexy vibe” on current single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT4UsCur0g8"><em>Release Party</em></a>, once again the conversational topic is therapy: Amstell’s own, mainly, as analysed in his autobiographical 2018 film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X-Z1N4sI2s"><em>Benjamin</em></a>, which he wrote and directed (and for which Righton wrote the music), and in his 2019 Netflix stand-up special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2yzIlrbteE"><em>Set Free</em></a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the deftly observed, beautifully acted former, Colin Morgan (<em>The Fall</em>) played a&nbsp;version of the 41-year-old from suburban East London. Benjamin was a&nbsp;filmmaker struggling to finish a&nbsp;follow-up to his acclaimed indie breakthrough, while also struggling not to be an insecure bellend in relationships. </p><p dir="ltr">In the latter – a&nbsp;gentler, more reflective style of comedy from the onetime TV presenter who brought <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bIC4V_DIrg">larky, sarky punch</a> to <em>Popworld</em> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L0bo6CTVgI"><em>Never Mind the Buzzcocks</em></a> – Amstell goes into confessional comedian mode: the musician who dumped him, the troubles with his dad, the sessions with a&nbsp;therapist, the <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>mild eating disorder” where he <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>tried a&nbsp;bit too hard to poo”. </p><p dir="ltr">In response to that last joke, <em>Set Free</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s live audience, filmed at EartH in Dalston, East London, laughed, but not that much. As the man said: you make stuff, you put it out, you have no control over anything else.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, in his upcoming live show, there’s more therapy, of the self-medication kind. Amstell’s 39-date <em>Spirit Hole</em> tour, running across England and Wales this autumn, is billed as a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>blissful, spiritual, sensational exploration of love, sex, shame, mushrooms and more”.</p><p dir="ltr">Amstell is wearing a&nbsp;straw hat, sunglasses and an on-hols-in-France shirt as we talk at a&nbsp;picnic table in Parliament Hill on Hampstead Heath, near the North London home he shares with his boyfriend of 10&nbsp;years. He’s been workshopping his new set in small venues for a&nbsp;few months now, the most recent one the previous night. His partner attended and pronounced <em>Spirit Hole</em> a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>very good show”, much to Amstell’s relief.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>He’s very critical,” he says, happily. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>And he’s an economist, so he doesn’t waste words.”<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="949828"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Simon_Amstell-Portrait.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="3600" height="5250" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Simon-Amstell-3.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="4724" height="6403" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Simon-Amstell-1.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="4724" height="6359" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949829"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Spirit Hole</em></strong><strong> – how informed is it by lockdown?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I’m not talking much about the pandemic at all, really. But I&nbsp;am talking about feelings that came up as a&nbsp;result of being inside for a&nbsp;while – and I’m talking about coming here to the Heath and eating magic mushrooms quite a&nbsp;bit. But it’s not like I’m doing a&nbsp;news report on Covid. That’s a&nbsp;relief, right?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was it about mushrooms that, shall we say, spoke to you in lockdown?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I was very lucky in that, before the pandemic, I’d been on an ayahuasca retreat in Peru, where I’d learned to surrender. And so when the pandemic happened, it wasn’t long before I&nbsp;remembered that surrender was the only option! And then by some strange coincidence, mushrooms seemed to come into my life as this medicine that was available here.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the connection?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I’d had a&nbsp;real struggle around being so healed by this plant medicine in the jungle, and feeling like: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>How am I&nbsp;supposed to talk about this in any way that is helpful, without it just being this annoying thing that most people can’t do?” But then I&nbsp;rediscovered magic mushrooms, which are growing out of the ground in this country. And it was this great relief that there was medicine available here! For free if you know the right fields!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Why did you go on the retreat?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">About 11&nbsp;years ago I&nbsp;kept hearing the word <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>ayahuasca” and eventually I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;just needed to go and experience it. And it really got to the root of my depression and I&nbsp;felt reset at the end. It was so profound and healing. You surrender to the medicine and the medicine takes you to where the depression came from. Rather than resisting the pain and trauma, you sit with it. And through sitting with it, it’s released.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>And then you were <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>called to” the mushrooms?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yes. They seemed to continue the work that was started in the jungle, which felt even more necessary when the pandemic started. But I&nbsp;can’t really describe what they did! There was a&nbsp;point where I&nbsp;said to the mushrooms: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Don’t worry if this doesn’t make sense.” And they went: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Oh really?” Then I&nbsp;was really shown some things!<br><br><strong>Oh, do tell.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, I&nbsp;feel like I’ve come out of the whole thing knowing things I&nbsp;didn’t know before, and that’s all gone into the new show. The wisdom that I&nbsp;gained from all this plant medicine is now jokes!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You were on </strong><strong><em>Popworld</em></strong><strong> between 2000 and 2006, alongside co-presenter </strong><a href="https://theface.com/audio/i-hate-suzie-sky-original-podcast-lucy-prebelle-miquita-oliver-episode-3"><strong>Miquita Oliver</strong></a><strong>, glorying in the innate daftness of pop. How was it for you?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It took a&nbsp;while for [the producers] to trust us. But after a&nbsp;year, it was really fun and silly. We were on a&nbsp;real mission to be truthful in a&nbsp;space where no one was asking for any truth – it was a&nbsp;silly pop show that was on very early on Channel 4. But we both were allergic to bullshit, and took great joy in exposing it.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="949830"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I don’t sit down to write and think: <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>What’s funny?’ I&nbsp;think: <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>What’s confusing, what’s troubling me, what feels painful at the moment?’&nbsp;”</p></blockquote><div class="pullquote__citation"><p>SIMON AMSTELL</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949831"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>That spirit of irreverence and anarchy and naughtiness is pretty much lacking from TV now, isn’t it?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Yeah. I&nbsp;got into TV because I&nbsp;loved <em>The Big Breakfast</em> for those reasons. The joy and anarchy of that show, it was just so colourful. Or <em>TFI Friday</em> – I&nbsp;did work experience for Ginger Productions just so I&nbsp;could be close to Chris Evans. But Chris Evans is a&nbsp;particular animal.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So where is the new Chris Evans?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, you need someone who wanted to be the new Chris Evans, which was me, so you’ve got that for a&nbsp;while!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In </strong><strong><em>Set Free</em></strong><strong>, you confess to having suffered from a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>mild eating disorder”. Then, when the audience’s response is less than uproarious, you say: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I don’t know if that bit was worth the truth.” Which was very funny. Was that a&nbsp;genuine feeling, that the initial laughter wasn’t enough to justify the confession?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah. The laugh means it was worth it – but if you say something out loud that you feel ashamed of and there’s silence, the shame can stay. But if there’s laughter, in that laughter people are saying: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Please, continue!” The acceptance is this treat you get for revealing something. Or maybe it was just funny to act ashamed. I’m contradicting myself with every answer.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>For the show to be great, does there have to be that sense of jeopardy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Yeah, I&nbsp;think so. I&nbsp;don’t sit down to write and think: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>What’s funny?” I&nbsp;think: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>What’s confusing, what’s troubling me, what feels painful at the moment?” I&nbsp;figure out what’s wrong with me by writing the stand-up. I&nbsp;realise that the stuff that’s going on in my head is just silly. And by the end you’ve got an hour’s worth of material where you’ve excavated all this insanity. It’s sort of what the mushrooms give you as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Apart from becoming a&nbsp;funghi fun guy, how did you fill the lockdown months?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’ve been binge-swimming! I’ll be going straight to [Hampstead Heath’s] Men’s Pond after this and jumping in. I&nbsp;also learned that I&nbsp;love writing. I&nbsp;felt an urge to do it again, rather than it being this treadmill. So I&nbsp;wrote another film. But the feeling of not being able to stand-up was very challenging. So the bliss now of being able to go on tour again is all very exciting.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What can you tell us about this new screenplay? Is it an action-adventure?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It’s definitely an adventure! <em>Benjamin</em> had a&nbsp;male protagonist, but his one has a&nbsp;female protagonist, and she’s a&nbsp;bit older than him and she’s got her own mind-forged manacles to escape from. So it’s similar in that there’s a&nbsp;person who’s got an idea of themselves that she needs to let go of.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What percentage autobiographical was the character of Benjamin in the sense of him being, emotionally, his own worst enemy?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That was pretty much me in my twenties. So I&nbsp;knew all the feelings, and I&nbsp;knew the journey he had to go on because I&nbsp;went on the same journey – partly during the writing of the film. I&nbsp;partly found out what was wrong with me through writing him. But there are only a&nbsp;few scenes where it was something that actually happened.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Was one of them a&nbsp;sexy role-playing evening with a&nbsp;partner as buff as </strong><a href="https://theface.com/culture/jack-rowan-peaky-blinders-noughts-and-crosses-actor-tv-film-bbc"><strong>Jack Rowan</strong></a><strong> tied to a&nbsp;chair in his tighty whities?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Oh, no! No, no, no. No, no, no. That’s funny. No, I&nbsp;wish. A&nbsp;bit of light S&amp;M – that would be a&nbsp;nice evening!<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949832"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spirit Hole</strong><strong><em> begins on 8</em></strong><strong><em>th</em></strong><strong><em> September in Margate.

        <![CDATA[
                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947997"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">A year <a href="https://theface.com/tag/covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devoid of social situations</a> means gossip and drama have been at an all-time low. I&nbsp;miss the loud and exaggerated <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>And that’s when I&nbsp;said…” followed by a&nbsp;chorus of <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Hmmm!”, as someone dishes dirt that has you clapping and slapping tables like the pastor’s message is genuinely hitting that Sunday. I&nbsp;miss meeting up with friends and hearing the low, menacing <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Now, between you and me…”, as if anyone around would be invested in the gossip. It’s OK to admit that chaos and mess is fun and slightly exhilarating. <br></p><p dir="ltr">This year, <em><a href="https://theface.com/tag/love-island" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Love Island</a></em> will be giving us more caucasian chaos at a&nbsp;time when we need it the most. I&nbsp;don’t think my heart is ready for a&nbsp;brunette woman in click-clack heels to be charging across the villa, drink in hand, to pull an unassuming blonde babe in a&nbsp;sequin ISAWITFIRST dress for a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>chat”. The scene will be, of course, audibly accompanied by some sort of girl boss rock song – you know the type. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of blonde babes, the past year has been incredibly difficult for hot people. If there was ever a&nbsp;time to be an ally to us, it is now: perceive us, observe us and stand with us as we re-enter society post-pandemic. And if there is one thing that<em> Love Island</em> does well, it’s giving TfL a&nbsp;run for its money when it comes to sourcing hot people. It’s basically hot people Christmas; a&nbsp;significant cultural event, a&nbsp;time for us to uplift and shade those in the community.</p><p dir="ltr">I&nbsp;know that the internet is having its yearly <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Diversity in <em>Love Island</em>” debate, as we once again position representation as the sole marker of progress and liberation, even when it’s a&nbsp;show that is known for mess and toxicity. But… OK? I’m aware hotness comes in all shapes and sizes, but the bland and seasonless hotness <em>Love Island</em> provides year on year is fine. There is something about not seeing my whole self – just the hot side – represented on the show that makes it that much more enjoyable.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="947998"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m calling for the abolition of lengthy talking stages.

In the real world, returning to the jungle of dating after being in a&nbsp;long-term, serious relationship is hell. How do you go from building a&nbsp;life with someone to replying <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>fine” to variations of <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Hey! How are you?” on a&nbsp;dating app every day? I’ve always wished we could zoom past that and go straight to the serious bits, so, for me, <em>Love Island</em> is how dating should be. I’m calling for the abolition of lengthy talking stages, an end to dates being seen as a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>treat” or something you <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>earn” instead of standard procedure. I&nbsp;say we all do first dates abroad. Let’s get to know each other under some southern European sun and then, eight weeks later, decide if we want to spend the rest of our lives together. We love <em>Love Island</em> because it’s the intense and fiery dating experience we all want. Sometimes it’s beautiful fireworks and other times it’s a&nbsp;dumpster fire. Either way, it’s always entertaining.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the show and its neon pink goodness, <em>Love Island</em> is nothing without Black Twitter. Every year, thousands of Black Twitter users have to book appointments with their local chiropractor after carrying the entire season of <em>Love Island</em> on their tired backs. The rush to react to hilarious moments on the show with memes, gifs and videos are all essential parts of the viewing experience. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--twitter-embed " data-block="948068"><div class="content-builder__block--s"><iframe width="320" height="320" frameBorder="0" src="https://twitter.com/mkaay_xo/status/1407118838165028866" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="948069"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Yes, news outlets and gossip pages try to collate these moments for content later, but it’s never the same as watching it happen live. Black excellence is <a href="https://theface.com/tag/simone-biles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Simone Biles</a>, it’s Serena Williams, it’s <a href="https://theface.com/tag/beyoncé" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beyoncé</a>. But it’s also the brave Black people who use up their remaining Apple Cloud storage space to save reaction videos to drop at <em>just</em> the right time during <em>Love Island</em>. Those are the real heroes we sing the national anthem <em>Talkin’ Da Hardest</em> for.</p><p dir="ltr">When I&nbsp;finally hear the oontz-oontz <em>Love Island</em> music, as whatever presenter is struggling to fill the role of the one and only Caroline Flack struts into a&nbsp;dreamy Diplo-esque music video villa, I&nbsp;might just faint with joy. ITV is doing more to heal the nation after a&nbsp;dreary year than the government ever could.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="948008"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949356"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">When we first <a href="https://theface.com/music/asakaa-ghana-drill-scene-kumasi-yaw-tog-jay-bahd-kawabanga-sean-lifer-o-kenneth-city-boy">reported</a> on the asakaa scene at the beginning of the year, the Ghanaian movement was just starting to figure on the global music radar. Since then, the sound from Kumerica has grown in leaps and bounds, becoming arguably the world’s hottest <a href="https://theface.com/tag/drill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drill</a> hub. Yaw Tog’s anthemic <em>Sore</em> housed a&nbsp;<a href="https://theface.com/contributors/stormzy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stormzy </a>verse on its remix, <a href="https://theface.com/music/headie-one-skepta-behind-the-scenes-back-to-basics-video" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headie One</a> touched base with Kumasi’s hottest stars during a&nbsp;visit to Ghana in April, and artists from eminent Kumasi record label, Life Living Records, are planning to tour Europe from July to August. It all hints asakaa’s ascension to the next level. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Much of the material that brought the scene to a&nbsp;global audience were viral singles that showcased the grittiness and vivid storytelling that makes music from Kumasi so compelling. So far, the Living Life records guys have gone for a&nbsp;singles-focused approach, churning out a&nbsp;relentless stream of standalone tracks which nearly always feature guest verses from rappers in the tight-knit scene. But it looks like asakaa artists could be establishing themselves by shifting towards projects, with Jay Bahd dropping his culturally-resonant <em>The return of Okomfo Anokye</em> this month and Reggie teasing the EP <em>2&nbsp;Times A&nbsp;Guy</em>. </p><p dir="ltr">This month’s column is led by <em><a href="https://twitter.com/JayBahd1?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T</a></em><em><a href="https://twitter.com/JayBahd1?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he return of Okomfo Anokye</a></em>, <a href="https://twitter.com/beatsbysarz?">Sarz</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lojaymusic/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lojay</a><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s sensual project, and a&nbsp;new genre-bending album from South African alternative duo, Stiff Pap.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="949357"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Jay Bahd - <em>The Return of Okomfo Anokye</em></h3></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="949358"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4bAX9bnd6nxETEgVjrLiKE" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949359"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Jay Bahd has always thrived in his role as asakaa’s gravelly-toned firestarter, delivering steely bars about Kumasi gang culture and wider life with a&nbsp;sneering assuredness on posse cuts like <em>Condemn</em>, <em>Akatafoc</em> and <em>Sore</em>. On <em>The Return of Okomfo Anokye</em>, Bahd, 22, couches his supreme confidence and braggadociousness in the cultural significance of Okomfo Anokye, a&nbsp;sage and diviner who co-founded the Asante Empire with its capital in Kumasi. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Joined by regular rhyming partners like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/seanlifer/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Lifer</a>, O’Kenneth and City Boy, Bahd pays homage to the rowdy energy of drill music on the album, also providing commentary on both the missteps and opportunities that living in Kumasi has presented him on tracks like <em>SIMAKU</em> and <em>See No Evil</em>. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>I’m a&nbsp;survivor/​Only the streets witness my pain,”</em> Bahd pensively offers on <em>U&nbsp;CAN’T SHOW ME NATTIN</em>, showing a&nbsp;mellow balance to his raucous persona.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="949360"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Stiff Pap – <em>Tuff Time$</em></h3></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="949361"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" allow="autoplay" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1270368112&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true&visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc;line-break: anywhere;word-break: normal;overflow: hidden;white-space: nowrap;text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif;font-weight: 100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/cotch-international" title="Cotch International" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Cotch International</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/cotch-international/sets/stiff-pap-tuff-time-out-24th" title="Stiff Pap - TUFF TIME$ [COTCH008]" target="_blank" style="color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;">Stiff Pap - TUFF TIME$ [COTCH008]</a></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949362"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Three years ago, post-kwaito music duo Stiff Pap founded the South African DIY creative collective <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ebumnandin/?hl=en">Ebumnandini</a>. In cities like Joburg, Cape Town and Durban, the crew has hosted raves for stylish, open-minded crowds and artists, which are soundtracked by an eclectic mix of punk, gqom, house, rap and amapiano.</p><p dir="ltr">On <em>Tuff Time$ </em>(which is accompanied by a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ud6QPRX8R_Q">short film</a>), Stiff Pap – made up of lead vocalist MC Ayema Problem and producer Jakinda – rebel against the dysfunctions of post-apartheid South Africa, tackling topics such as classism, racism and economic inequality across the album’s 10 uncompromising tracks. In one moment of unbridled honesty on <em>Caster Semenya</em>, Ayema points out the fact that apartheid still exists and Black people keep ending up dead atop Jakinda’s emotive, experimental production.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="949363"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Sarz and Lojay – <em>LV N ATTN</em></h3></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="949364"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7zx9F3ehp4NIcts4Tq0Oc8" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949365"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">While Afrobeats vocalists continue to receive acclaim for their infectious music, the importance of producers shouldn’t be overlooked. A&nbsp;big part of the current Afrobeats style was codified by innovative beatsmiths like OJB Jezreel and Don Jazzy, who in the mid-2000s matched US hip-hop’s bassy heft with the sweet melodies and hip-shaking percussion of west African genres. And from the 2010s onward, no producer has expanded the range of African pop music in the country like Sarz.</p><p dir="ltr">Two years ago, Sarz released his debut project, a&nbsp;beat tape titled <em>Sarz Is Not Your Mate</em> before closing out 2019 with the electronic-influenced <em>I&nbsp;Love Girls With Trobul</em>, a&nbsp;joint album with Nigerian-American soul singer WurlD. Sarz’s new project, <em>LV N&nbsp;ATTN</em> is a&nbsp;collaborative EP with rising Nigerian star Lojay. It’s another creative frontier for Sarz, who merges Afropop’s sensual essence with a&nbsp;moody overcast across psychedelic tracks that sound enthralling. Lojay’s vulnerable vocals swim dreamily favourites like <em>Tonongo</em> and <em>Mona Lisa</em>. Even when Wizkid shows up on the project’s titular track, his playful chirping and superstar presence doesn’t overshadow the vibe that Sarz and Lojay have created.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="949366"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Ibejii  – Gonto</h3></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--youtube-or-vimeo " data-block="949367"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kn8IzZMgLHc?wmode=transparent" title="External video from youtube" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="true" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949368"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Recording in an eclectic mix of English, Yoruba and pidgin, Ibejii’s soulful elegies cast the singer as a&nbsp;stream of consciousness for a&nbsp;generation simultaneously pining for the comforts of nostalgia and confronting the duality of the human condition. Ibejii’s songs are layered and laced with metaphors steeped in the Yoruba tradition and, as last year’s <em>Ìlù Ìlú</em> proved, his message is gets clearer with each project.</p><p dir="ltr">On <em>Gonto</em>, Ibejii’s first single of 2021 and the lead track from a&nbsp;forthcoming album, the singer delivers a&nbsp;sobering reflection on last year’s momentous #EndSARS protests. Gliding over an orchestral instrumental, he situates the resistance that powered the anti-police brutality protests in a&nbsp;wider global movement for the freedom of the oppressed, condemning the governments who are stubbornly insensitive to Black suffering.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--heading " data-block="949369"><div class="content-builder__block--m content-builder__heading"><div class="copy"><h3 class="content-builder__heading">Angélique Kidjo – <em>Mother Nature</em></h3></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="949370"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/3phDjtPilkdOx6nr66aXC5" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949371"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">One year ago, while receiving a&nbsp;Grammy Award in the Best World Music Album category for <em>Celia</em>, Angélique Kidjo paid tribute to the new generation of artists coming from Africa, stressing that they were poised to change perceptions of the continent. On her latest album, <em>Mother Nature</em>, Kidjo engages that new generation of African artists in conversation over throbbing beats inspired by Afropop, soukous, and soul.</p><p dir="ltr">Zimbabwean-American singer, Shungudzo, matches Kidjo’s urgency on <em>Choose Love</em> where they make a&nbsp;plea for Africa to take a&nbsp;lead in making the world a&nbsp;better place (“<em>Had a&nbsp;beautiful dream that I&nbsp;woke up and all the bombs in the world had been blown</em>,” Ms. Kidjo sings.) Salif Keita was cajoled out of retirement for a&nbsp;cameo on <em>Africa, One of A&nbsp;Kind</em>, also featuring Mr. Eazi. Elsewhere, the album opens up to the inventive sounds of the Black diaspora, pairing Blue Lab Beats and Ghetto Boy with Kidjo for a&nbsp;groovy funk number on <em>Fired Up</em>.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--single-ticker " data-block="949372"><div class="content-builder__block--ticker"><ul class="ticker ticker--article"><li class="ticker__horizontal ticker__horizontal--sans" id="ticker-949373"><div         title="Read more"

In his most confident collection yet, the creative director goes for a sickly-sweet power punch of hyper-colours, bold shapes and a dream-like short film.

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949598"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">For Virgil Abloh, each season at Louis Vuitton has been a&nbsp;ceremony. Since he took the helm of the menswear line in 2018, the creative director has meandered his way through politics, sartorial codes, race and gender, bringing cross-generational talents into his world to playful effect.</p><p dir="ltr">This season, he presented <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6M8ECbc3RIM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amen Break</a>,</em> a&nbsp;short film with a&nbsp;rolling list of friends involved: GZA, Goldie, Lupe Fiasco and Kandis Williams, to name a&nbsp;few. The 16-minute short film, directed by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mahfuzsultan/?hl=en">Mahfuz Sultan</a>, tells a&nbsp;story about a&nbsp;father and son united by an unnamed loss, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>crossing a&nbsp;dream world to deliver a&nbsp;message to the other side,” the show notes add. <br><br>But along the way, in a&nbsp;dreamscape sequence, the child finds himself conspired against by unknown forces. But like all good fairy tales, superheroes pop up every so often to lead him along the path to his father. Its concept looks at life’s supporting figures: fighters, boundary breakers, protestors and – a&nbsp;theme running through his last collection – those re-thinking archetypes. <br><br>Conceptually, the idea was informed by Amen Break, a&nbsp;scarcely-known drum break that became an imperative part of hip-hop and jungle beats, sampled in a&nbsp;myriad of tracks. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>The film reflects on a&nbsp;historic moment in Black art and culture when electronic music and hip-hop emerged like twins from the same egg and trickled into every part of the globe,” the press notes explain.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="949599"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV27.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV32.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV01.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV06.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV04.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1500" height="2099" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV09.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV07.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV12.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV14.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV16.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV20.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV25.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/LV34.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1501" height="2100" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="949600"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">The film’s narrative is inspired by the life of Lupe Fiasco, one of the film’s characters. The Grammy-nominated fine artist and rapper grew up on the Southside of Chicago during a&nbsp;turbulent time of gang warfare in the 1970s and <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>80s, but he was determined to find different ways for young people to escape the area. <br><br>And so Fiasco’s father, an African drummer and member of the Black Panther Party, organised martial arts lessons as an alternative path. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>By employing the philosophical values of martial arts as a&nbsp;solution to the problem, Fiasco impacted a&nbsp;generation of kids with ideas of peace, understanding and empowerment,” read the press notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Following on from last season, Abloh’s sartorial vision is elegance in its extremities. Suiting leads the way, with blazers tied at the waist and shoulders sharp and narrow. The moulded top hat makes a&nbsp;reappearance once again, becoming something of a&nbsp;signature of Abloh’s Vuitton tenure. </p><p dir="ltr">Once the suiting arrives, shapes become distorted and contorted to dramatic effect. On an electric blue, padded jumper, protective shapes resemble a&nbsp;superhuman costume. Prints take over entire outfits, like a&nbsp;two-piece suit and short combo bleached with blue and white tie-dye. The most striking of all, though, is a&nbsp;patchworked coat plastered with rave flyers. Optimistic for the near-future are we, Virgil?</p><p dir="ltr">This seems to be Abloh’s most confident and experimental collection to date. An all-out feast of Day-Glo greens, yellows and acid pinks, LV monogram-printed denim and playful fuzzy headwear, it’s a&nbsp;keen reminder that the designer’s stamp on Louis Vuitton is pure giddy power.<br></p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>

At the time of writing, the rogue developer behind the scam has made at least 9000 <a href="https://theface.com/life/best-cryptocurrencies-investing-bitcoin-dogecoin-cumrocket-ether-monero-basic-attention-cardano">Moneros</a> – a&nbsp;<a href="https://theface.com/search?query=cryptocurrency">cryptocurrency</a> renowned for giving users an unprecedented amount of privacy.

A&nbsp;hard bargain to turn down, for sure, but how has Crackonosh made so much money?<br><br>Hidden inside each game is a&nbsp;piece of crypto-mining malware that secretly generates digital currency once the game has been downloaded.

The 80-year-old’s creations have affected not just the clothes on our back, but culture as a&nbsp;whole: her role as one of the key architects of punk in the 1970s not only defined an epoch, but shaped ensuing generations’ reactions to the world around them, both aesthetically and ideologically. </p><p dir="ltr">Printed across a&nbsp;T‑shirt was the slogan <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Destroy”. The language was writ large: a&nbsp;destruction of the status quo. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It was about smashing all the values,” she said subsequently of the movement. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>All the taboos of a&nbsp;world that was so cruel and unjust, mismanaged and corrupt.” She is still a&nbsp;punk. </p><p dir="ltr">Her life and work have been shaped by an insatiable urge to fight against convention. Westwood frequently quotes the philosopher Bertrand Russell – <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>orthodoxy is the grave of intelligence.” She once added: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>If you accept that something is right, just because everybody believes it, then you’re not thinking. You have to look at other points of view and then make up your own mind.” Today, designing alongside Andreas Kronthaler, her husband and creative partner of three decades, she continues that crusade against the expected, the anticipated, the orthodox. She makes up her own mind.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="948339"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.303-ANGLOMANIA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="427" height="675" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>© firstVIEW/IMAXtree</strong><em>ANGLOMANIA</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.296-ANGLOMANIA.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="321" height="505" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>© firstVIEW/IMAXtree</strong><em>ANGLOMANIA</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.245-DRESSING-UP.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="370" height="590" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>© firstVIEW/IMAXtree<br /></strong><em>DRESSING UP</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.2-VIVE-LA-COCOTTE.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="548" height="803" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>© Marineau/Tordoir/Catwalkpictures.com<br /></strong><em>VIVE LA COCOTTE</em><strong></strong></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.52-NOSTALGIA-OF-MUD.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="256" height="477" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong><strong>© Anthea Simms</strong></strong></p><p><em>NOSTALGIA OF MUD</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.596-7.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="232" height="455" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>© firstVIEW/IMAXtree</strong></p><p>7</p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.410-TIED-TO-THE-MAST.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="312" height="478" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>© firstVIEW/IMAXtree<br /><em><br /></em></strong><em>TIED TO THE MAST</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.199-PORTRAIT.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="285" height="514" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><strong>Niall McIerney, Photographer. <strong>© Bloomsbury Publishing Plc</strong></strong></p><p><em>PORTRAIT</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/p.93-HYPNOS.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="312" height="450" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p>Niall McIerney, Photographer. <strong>© Bloomsbury Publishing Plc<br /></strong><em>HYPNOS</em><strong></strong></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="948340"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">That standpoint is the reason Westwood’s work continues to be so prominent: she has an intense curiosity – about the world at large, about history, art, politics and the environment. It is often reflected in her conversation, and her collections. Westwood originally studied to be a&nbsp;teacher, educating young children for a&nbsp;period of five years, before her fashion career began. Even today she seeks, constantly, to impart knowledge, to tell you something, through both her words and her designs. Her love of the graphic T‑shirt lies in its simplicity, both as a&nbsp;pure example of design and as a&nbsp;placard for a&nbsp;message. She used it for punk slogans, inciting destruction of the status quo; for Old Master paintings celebrating high culture; latterly, for environmental slogans reflecting her concern over the state of the planet. When you speak with Westwood, you ask few questions and receive long answers.</p><p dir="ltr">Westwood studies the history of fashion back to its sources and its history fascinates her. However, if she has ever paid attention to modern fashion – a&nbsp;genuine question, given how singular her work has always appeared – it is only to buck against it and challenge received notions of modernity and beauty. When fashion surged towards minimalism, Westwood designed collections of rich baroque excess; when fashion wanted women to look powerful and masculine and rich in the mid-1980s, Westwood championed the disenfranchised, proposing clothes with soft curves and rounded shoulders, and declared: <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>In Italy they take expensive cloth and make it look boring, but I&nbsp;take basic fabric and make it look timeless. They just don’t understand what I’m trying to do.”</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="948341"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>Vivienne Westwood Catwalk: The Collections <em>is published by Thames &amp;&nbsp;Hudson and is available at <a href="https://thamesandhudson.com/vivienne-westwood-catwalk-the-complete-collections-9780500023792" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thame​sand​hud​son​.com </a></em></p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947063"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">With a&nbsp;smiley face bucket hat on his head, Gregory Diaz IV beams down the Zoom lens as he recalls his time filming <em>In The Heights. </em>An adaptation of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s latest Tony-winning musical, it’s a&nbsp;blockbuster of epic proportions that celebrates New York’s vibrant Latinx community (although it has been criticised for its lack of Afro-Latino representation). There’s singing, there’s rapping, there’s dancing and there’s romance – everything you need for a&nbsp;post-pandemic, feel-good summer hit.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I felt like I&nbsp;was going to summer camp everyday to hang out with friends and family. The cast is truly like my second family now,” says Diaz of the filming experience. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Just the experience of being on set with such a&nbsp;large Latinx community, both on and off the camera, I’ve never been a&nbsp;part of something like that before. It was really eye opening and just great to be able to show the positives behind our culture and really help represent.”<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="947064"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0CL-ZSuCrQ' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947065"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Now 16, Diaz has been in the limelight throughout his teenage years, getting his first taste of musical theatre in productions of <em>You’re a&nbsp;Good Man, Charlie Brown</em> and <em>Matilda</em> in 2016. Since then, you might have seen him pop up in Netflix’s <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Shmidt</em> or 2020’s <em>Vampires vs. The Bronx</em>, a&nbsp;comedy horror that takes on gentrification with holy water and homemade weapons. <br></p><p dir="ltr">For <em>In The Heights</em>, Diaz stepped into the shoes of Sonny, a&nbsp;plucky teen with big dreams and odds stacked against him. He’ll make you laugh, for sure, but he might also make you shed a&nbsp;tear or two, as Sonny comes to terms with the systemic barriers that might prevent him going to college. But, to be fair, the whole film is full of tear jerk moments, both happy and sad.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I saw [the film] with my mum and dad. It didn’t really sink in until the end. I&nbsp;look over and they’re both crying. I’m like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Why are you crying?’ And I&nbsp;immediately started crying right after that,” Diaz says, before feigning a&nbsp;sob. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It was like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Oh, this is why you’re crying’.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">There’s no (real) tears today, though. Instead, Diaz presents THE FACE with his five most treasured items, that bring on all smiles when he thinks about them. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--styling-section " data-block="947066"><div class="styling-section styling-section--decontain styling-section--paddingOnTopAndBottom styling-section--noMargin"

I&nbsp;just love going to the Yankees’ stadium. It’s in the Bronx, where I&nbsp;and a&nbsp;lot of my dad’s side of the family grew up. It’s great to go together to a&nbsp;baseball game.

It’s also a&nbsp;reminder of when I&nbsp;really found my love for performing, because I&nbsp;realised that it was something I&nbsp;wanted to do when I&nbsp;saw <em>Matilda</em> on Broadway around the age of 10. Just seeing kids my age on stage acting, singing and dancing, which I&nbsp;had never seen before, immediately made a&nbsp;connection with it. The first goal that I&nbsp;had set for myself in my young career was to be a&nbsp;part of <em>Matilda. </em>I&nbsp;auditioned two to three times and became a&nbsp;part of the project when I&nbsp;was around 11.”</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--styling-section " data-block="947079"><div class="styling-section styling-section--decontain styling-section--paddingOnTopAndBottom styling-section--marginBelow"

It’s hands down one of the best wrap gifts I&nbsp;have ever gotten, because it captures the beauty of that summer filming so well. Like I&nbsp;said, the cast is truly like a&nbsp;second family and whenever I&nbsp;miss them I&nbsp;just flip through the book. Some of them are professional photos, like when we were doing camera testing, and then some of them are selfies. And it’s not just the cash too, it’s also of the crew, so it’s really nice. My favourite pictures are probably the ones of me… Just kidding. There’s a&nbsp;picture of me, the director Jon M. Chu, Corey Hawkins, Anthony Ramos and Noah Catala – that’s Usnavi, Benny, Sonny and Graffiti Pete [in the film]. We’re walking down the street for the song <em>96,000</em> in between takes.

And music and art collective <a href="https://www.nyegenyege.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nyege Nyege</a> has been a&nbsp;key force within the movement. </p><p dir="ltr">Co-founded in 2013 by Burundian creative Derek Debru and Greek-Armenian ethnomusicologist Arlen Dilsizian, Nyege Nyege has taken African artists on tour across Europe and Asia. In 2015 they launched a&nbsp;recording studio and an annual festival, held at Lake Victoria, the source of the Nile, which has hosted western DJs Juan Atkins, Josey Rebelle and Julianna Huxtable alongside African acts.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="947179"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Kampire-c-Darlyne-Komukama2.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1750" height="1234" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><div class="image-credits">            Photography Darlyne Komukama

After returning to Kampala from Ohio just over a&nbsp;decade ago, she joined Nyege Nyege, DJing at the collective’s parties in Kampala clubs as well as at the Nyege Nyege festival, the Amani festival in Congo and Burkina Faso’s Africa Bass Culture event. She also became a&nbsp;fixture on the international festival circuit. Now, with lockdown restrictions easing here, she has a&nbsp;handful of UK dates lined up for the second half of 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The 34-year-old’s sets are an exhilarating journey through genres such as Afrobeats, Afrohouse, gengetone, kwaito and Dennery Segment, the latter Saint Lucia’s buoyant interpretation of Soca music. Every mix feels like it’s delivered with the same goal: to make sweat-soaked revellers party <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>til sunrise.</p><p dir="ltr">Catching up with <em>The FACE</em> from her apartment in Kampala, the DJ shares her thoughts on the future of the Ugandan electronic scene and the next frontier of western engagement with the African music sector.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947166"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tell me about your background.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">My parents are Ugandan but I&nbsp;grew up in Zambia. I&nbsp;lived there for 16&nbsp;years and we lived kind of an immigrant or expat life, because we’d hang out with the other east Africans. There were some Kenyans and one or two Ugandan families. I&nbsp;went to a&nbsp;US school [in Ohio] for about four years after high school, and then I&nbsp;moved back to Kampala more than 10&nbsp;years ago. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Why did you decide to come back to Kampala?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Growing up in countries that are not necessarily your own, I&nbsp;wanted to find out if Kampala could be home for me. I&nbsp;had been in the US for four years and, after that experience, I&nbsp;knew I&nbsp;could definitely not live in the West. I&nbsp;decided to try out Kampala and I&nbsp;didn’t know I’d end up staying permanently. It’s the closest thing to home that I&nbsp;have found on this planet, and when I&nbsp;moved back it was a&nbsp;party city – and even more so 10&nbsp;years ago because I&nbsp;don’t necessarily feel as safe as I&nbsp;did 10&nbsp;years ago. When I&nbsp;first came back, we’d go out at 3am and I’d get on a&nbsp;boda boda [local motorcycles] and be very drunk and not have to worry about how I’d get home as a&nbsp;single woman. It’s not so much like that anymore, but it’s still a&nbsp;big party city.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What music is really exciting you at the moment?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I listen to everything to be honest, but I&nbsp;really like Kenyan gengetone. I&nbsp;think it’s vibes but it’s also really exciting what the artists are doing with the sound. I&nbsp;also love Ugandan pop music, it’s influenced by dancehall and <a href="https://theface.com/tag/afrobeats" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Afrobeats</a>. There are a&nbsp;number of genres that I&nbsp;love that are less popular like electronics from northern Uganda, singeli music from Tanzania and the interesting things coming out of the South African underground. I&nbsp;also like Dennery Segment, a&nbsp;sub-genre of Saint Lucian Soca music. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="947167"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p>To some people in the west, Africa is still an idea and a&nbsp;DJ set may be their only interaction with a&nbsp;real African</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947168"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Nyege Nyege festival is one of the most celebrated on the continent. How has it shaped your career?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The success has been very gratifying for me because I&nbsp;was not a&nbsp;DJ before I&nbsp;got involved in the Nyege Nyege festival. I&nbsp;feel like my success as a&nbsp;DJ and the success of Nyege Nyege have been very intertwined. I&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;lot of the reason why people are interested in me as a&nbsp;DJ is because of the community that I&nbsp;come from. It started as just a&nbsp;fun thing that we were doing with friends and trying to create a&nbsp;space for people in east Africa who listen to alternative music, as well as east African acts who make incredible music but don’t always break into the Top 40. We felt like they deserved an audience. To see people embrace the festival and the success of myself and [frequent Nyege Nyege collaborator] Otim Alpha as a&nbsp;result of the festival has been better than I&nbsp;could ever have imagined. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Ugandan music scene has also evolved since Nyege Nyege started in 2015. What’s changed?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think the biggest difference – and it can’t be credited to just Nyege Nyege – is that there is space for alternative music, parties and acts. In 2015, there weren’t a&nbsp;lot and we didn’t know where to go or who to follow. But right now there are a&nbsp;lot of events that are inspired by music outside the Top 40. Afro-house, <a href="https://theface.com/tag/amapiano">amapiano</a> and techno, there’s more space for that even in Kampala. We still have a&nbsp;long way to go in making the scene even broader because Uganda has such a&nbsp;diverse music heritage. If we’re just trying to make music that’s derivative of Afrobeats or dancehall, that’s fun. But I&nbsp;don’t know that that’s where growth is necessarily. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you think Western engagement with African music and art is moving beyond being a&nbsp;source of cultural clout to something more engaging?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think it is evolving. Western actors getting involved in the space are now very cognisant of how the West has been very extractive in the past. So, DJs would come to east Africa and take a&nbsp;sample of someone playing a&nbsp;traditional instrument and make a&nbsp;track off it when they go back. But the people who were involved in that process are not aware of what happens next – they don’t get production credits or anything like that. </p><p dir="ltr">Now, that has changed and the people I’m aware of are trying to engage equitably with African artists. There is still a&nbsp;power differential but they are more aware of world issues and the disparities between people. Obviously, to some people in the West, Africa is still an idea and a&nbsp;DJ set may be their only interaction with a&nbsp;real African. That brings a&nbsp;certain feeling of representation, but I&nbsp;try not to think too much about that. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="947169"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Kampire-watermelon16-c-Darlyne-Komukama10_plustwofive.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1750" height="1233" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><div class="image-credits">            Photography Darlyne Komukama

So wherever I&nbsp;play, I&nbsp;just try to throw different tracks out and see what people react to. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was 2020 like for you, with the pandemic and all the disruptions it caused?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Before the pandemic, touring was my main work and I&nbsp;was on tour for about seven months out of the year. Not touring was a&nbsp;big change, but it was also nice to be home and have space to focus on some things. I’ve also [done livestreamed DJ gigs] but they’re not as fun because, for me, DJing is about real-time exchange of energy. I&nbsp;did a&nbsp;few of those but in the end, I&nbsp;stopped. I’ve also worked on other creative endeavours like learning to produce and working on compilations. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you have specific plans for when the world opens up again?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I’m hopeful that it will be safe to travel and play at shows again, but it is complicated to travel as an African artist. I&nbsp;don’t think it’s going to be easier once you bring in testing and vaccination and all of that because it’s really a&nbsp;money-making scheme for a&nbsp;lot of African governments. But I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;couple of shows booked. Asides from that, I&nbsp;have compilations and remixes that I’ve been working on. And that’s keeping me sane. </p><p dir="ltr"><em>Kampire is playing </em><em><a href="https://www.thewarehouseproject.com/event/repercussion-festival">Repercussion festival</a> in</em><em> Manchester on 18<sup class="ordinal">th</sup> September.

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947629"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Beyond the implied glitz and glamour of celebrity status, being an artist in the mainstream music industry is a&nbsp;particularly cut-throat line of work. We’ve seen countless apples of the public eye crash and burn in the pursuit of becoming a&nbsp;pop star and staying relevant. It’s hard to avoid being chewed up and spat out.</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">Mabel McVey is a&nbsp;pop star in the most effective of terms; impeccably styled, madly charming and the darling of her one million Instagram followers. She’s learnt a&nbsp;thing or two about the pitfalls of the modern music business since fourth single <em>Finders Keepers</em> reached the UK Top 10&nbsp;in 2017. <br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947630"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">The 25-year-old singer is an artist label heads dream of. She’s a&nbsp;chameleon entertainer, able to slip into various genres with ease, collaborating with <a href="https://theface.com/music/uk-rap-reload-shaybo-frosty-m-huncho-potter-payper-backroad-gee-nafe-smallz-teezandos-k-trap-v9-s1mba-abra-cadabra-br3nya">Afroswing</a> artists like Not3s and Kojo Funds, as well as commercial dance juggernauts like Tiësto and Jax Jones.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Finders Keepers</em> made Mabel a&nbsp;rising star, putting her under pressure to top her blow-out hit. She did that with 2019’s <em>Don’t Call Me Up</em>, which peaked at Number 3&nbsp;and later appeared on her debut album, the suggestively titled <em>High Expectations</em>. In February last year, a&nbsp;few weeks before the first UK lockdown, she won Female Solo Artist at the 2020 BRIT Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, it all became too much.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947631"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><div class="copy__floated-image copy__floated-image--rightAligned"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/FACE_CloseUP_ARTWORK_MABEL_2.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1440" height="1800" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Mabel wears </em><em>Jean Paul Gaultier and La Manson jewellery</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><p dir="ltr">On the surface, Mabel’s been very active during the pandemic. She’s kept her social media output steady, and in 2020 three of her tracks reached the top 10 – <em>Boyfriend</em>, <em>West Ten</em> with AJ Tracey and <em>Tick Tock, </em>the infectiously catchy collaboration with Clean Bandit and 24kGoldn. But behind the scenes, she forced herself to take a&nbsp;much-needed break from writing and recording, also minimising her press schedule to prioritise her emotional and mental wellbeing.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I was really tired, I&nbsp;kind of needed a&nbsp;minute,” she says of dealing with the heady stream of success, touring and travelling she experienced alongside releasing <em>High Expectations</em>. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Nothing can really prepare you for the 2019 that I&nbsp;had. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Sometimes I’d wake up and be like: <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>I don’t know what fucking country I’m in.’ It was incredible, but also I&nbsp;think it took me out of a&nbsp;creative space for a&nbsp;long time.”<br><br>Now feeling replenished, Mabel is ready to get going again. She’s speaking over Zoom from her home studio in London on a&nbsp;day where she’s juggling myriad promotional obligations. She’s chipper and alert, gleefully pinging out answers in between bites of salad. Her anthemic comeback single <em>Let Them Know </em>seems destined for the dancefloor, as soon as we’re all allowed to do that sort of thing.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I just got really inspired by thinking about wanting to be out again, that sense of freedom that we’re all going to have when we’re able to meet up, dance and enjoy music together,” Mabel says of <em>Let Them Know</em>, which she co-wrote along with MNEK, SG Lewis and RAYE. “[It came from] reminiscing on those times that were so easy to take for granted before. Now if you ask me if I&nbsp;wanna link, I’m never gonna say no!” she adds with a&nbsp;laugh.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="947632"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/ehcRu2xPXHU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947633"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><em>Let Them Know</em> is inspired by the music of ballroom and voguing culture, the telltale signs being its knocking house rhythms and the equally sassy refrain, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>Baby, you’re that bitch</em>”. Mabel had watched classic ball culture doc <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SqvD1-0odY"><em>Paris is Burning</em></a> (1990) as a&nbsp;kid with her mother and been privy to the underground scene by way of her godfather, the late fashion maverick (and OG FACE stylist) Judy Blame. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I think I’ve grown up with so many people around me that have immersed me in ballroom and vogue culture – like, my mum’s been going to ballrooms her whole life.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I just want to give a&nbsp;nod to that world and celebrate it,” she continues of a&nbsp;scene created by queer and trans innovators in New York. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>So many people don’t know that they’re inspired by that culture. Pop music, dancing, pop culture – it all looks the way that it does because of that world.”<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="947634"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>There’s been so much darkness – I’m the person who’s going to bring light”</p></blockquote><div class="pullquote__citation"><p>MABEL</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947635"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Mabel’s musical family is no secret at this point. She’s the daughter of <a href="https://theface.com/tag/neneh-cherry">Neneh Cherry</a> and Massive Attack producer Cameron Mcvey. Her step-grandad was legendary free jazz musician Don Cherry, whilst sisters <a href="https://theface.com/music/tyson-mcvey-interview-red-handed-ep-neneh-cherry-four-tet-ladies-music-pub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyson</a> and Naima are also recording artists, making leftfield R&amp;B and improvisational electro-jazz respectively. </p><p dir="ltr">Mabel enthuses over the diverse background that shaped her upbringing, from being born in Malaga, Spain and growing up between Stockholm and London, eventually settling here aged 18. But ironically, the nomadic lifestyle made her crave the kind of mundanity most people dream of escaping in their younger years. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Me and Tyson are always joking about how we both had this weird fantasy of wanting a&nbsp;clear, suburban background, where we ate potato smileys,” she recalls with a&nbsp;smile. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Like, my mum would never allow food like that in our house.” <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="947636"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/FACE_CloseUP_ARTWORK_MABEL_3.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1440" height="1800" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Mabel wears Sevali, boots Marc Jacobs, jewellery Coup de Coeur, Shedeans and Vellva</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/FACE_CloseUP_ARTWORK_MABEL_4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1440" height="1800" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Mabel wears Sevali, boots Marc Jacobs, jewellery Coup de Coeur, Shedeans and Vellva</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947637"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Before finally settling in London, she’d spent her teen years in Sweden and found it difficult to grasp her identity. With her mother of Sierra Leonean-Swedish heritage and her father both English and Scottish, her mixed-race background was a&nbsp;source of anxiety (“they don’t really have a&nbsp;word for mixed-race [in Sweden]”) and the teenage Mabel grappled with mental health struggles.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’ve had a&nbsp;lot of self-worth and confidence issues growing up. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;difficult time socially in school. I&nbsp;stopped going at 15, because I&nbsp;just couldn’t deal with the idea of what other people may or may not have been thinking.”</p><p dir="ltr">This, in part, explains her recent struggles.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s a&nbsp;tale as old as time. Long hours, relentless promo, and proximity to negative opinions can do its best to nip away at even the most seasoned performer. And for anyone wanting to maintain relevance, there’s a&nbsp;pressure to keep running on the high. Keep up with press and social media, with fans adamant for new releases, or risk failure.</p><p dir="ltr">Mabel pauses, reflecting on how the stress and anxiety of the past few years caught up with her.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m still so grateful that I’ve had those experiences and got so much support from people and radio and publications, like I&nbsp;was living my dream in many ways. But personally, I&nbsp;just didn’t know how to deal with some of that. I&nbsp;saw the horrible things that people would say about me seep into what I&nbsp;already thought about myself. It all eventually piled up.”</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="947638"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><div class="copy__floated-image copy__floated-image--leftAligned"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/FACE_CloseUP_ARTWORK_MABEL_5.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1440" height="1800" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Mabel wears Annakiki, corset Statnaia, jewellery La Manson and Yaa Yaa London </em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><p dir="ltr">So in a&nbsp;world where prioritising rest is unthinkable, she shifted against industry culture and took a&nbsp;break – albeit one that still allowed her to release three tracks last year. Mabel moved back in with her parents during the pandemic and generally spent more time with family. It’s given her space to claw back her confidence, reassess her priorities and figure out her personhood in the process. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Everything’s so disposable and has to be done yesterday – I&nbsp;can’t function like that,” she tells me. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I now know the things that I&nbsp;need in order to be the best artist and person I&nbsp;can be, just to be a&nbsp;functioning human being. I&nbsp;like to horse ride, I&nbsp;like to dance, I&nbsp;like to read. These are all things I&nbsp;found out about myself since I&nbsp;just stopped the madness!”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr">Now, Mabel’s creative energy is recharged. She’s working on her second album, which she’s planning to release later this year. The new music is deliciously in-your-face, she says, a&nbsp;series of full-on dance records inspired by Madonna, CeCe Peniston and Whitney Houston. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Freedom and celebration are the keywords I’m using to describe the music that I’m making now, because there’s been so much darkness. When I&nbsp;went back to make music, I [had to ask myself], either I’m focusing on those things, or I’m going to be the person who’s going to bring light.”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span><em>No, they can’t beat you down,” </em>Mabel sings on the hook of <em>Let Them Know</em>, her slick braggadocio intended to inspire listeners who’ve also been struggling with their confidence in recent times. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It’s not about needing to be sassy all the time, it’s also about those moments when you’re feeling insecure – can you still know that you’re that bitch? Can you still tell yourself that you are worthy?”</p><p dir="ltr"></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>All the little things [I think] about myself – <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>I can’t do this, or be like this as an artist’ – I’m gonna wear all of those awkward things proudly,” Mabel concludes with a&nbsp;sense of determination. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>And I&nbsp;just want people to do the same.”</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--accordion " data-block="947639"><div class="accordion" data-allow-multiple="true"><div class="accordion__item"><h2 class="accordion__title content-builder__block--m"><button class="accordion__button" aria-controls="content-10">

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="944968"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">By now, we’re all either using or are pretty well versed in <a href="https://theface.com/music/tiktok-music-viral-doja-cat-roddy-ricch-ashnikko-lil-nas-x-volume-4-issue-003">the colossal impact of TikTok</a> across the entertainment landscape. Since TikTok’s 2018 merger with musi​cal​.ly, the video platform has accelerated the trajectories of acts such as <a href="https://theface.com/music/doja-cat-los-angeles-rapper-youtube-volume-4-issue-002">Doja Cat</a>, <a href="https://theface.com/music/flo-milli-rap-ho-why-is-you-here-mixtape-release">Flo Milli</a>, Young T &amp;&nbsp;Bugsey and Lil Nas X (to name just a&nbsp;few). Take Flo Milli, for example. Her breakout <em>Beef FloMix</em> success on the app and of subsequent <em>In The Party</em> (now used in over 300,000 videos on the app to date), helped foreground the singles’ primetime, gold status via the Recording Industry Association of America in recent months.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Outside of musicians usurping TikTok’s tools and tactics in a&nbsp;bid to secure mainstay status, consumers are also re-discovering an array of music from yesteryear, nourishing their yearn for nostalgia (or maybe their quarter-life mini-crises). The leap towards sentimentality at large, however, is hardly a&nbsp;new phenomenon – just look at Spotify’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>wrapped” campaign, or our constant time stamps on various Facebook-owned subsidiaries.</p><p dir="ltr">A particular trend focusing on songs from children’s cartoons (adults well over 25 are involved, too) emerged on TikTok earlier this year. This is partly due to 19-year-old Merlysha Pierre, AKA @<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@swagsurfff?lang=en">swagsurfff</a><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s, multiple visuals breaking down songs from Nickelodeon mainstay <em>The Backyardigans</em>, which first aired over a&nbsp;decade ago on the network. Because of Pierre’s efforts, <em>The Backyardigans</em>’ track <em>Castaways</em> mustered its way to the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ikrd/backyardigans-tiktok-castaway">apex</a> of Spotify’s Viral Song’s chart last month.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="944969"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//DklRfVqOceo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="944970"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Many childhood theme and soundtrack songs have <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>broken TikTok” in the past, including a&nbsp;trap-leaning variant of <em>Ben 10</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s intro last year. However, as time goes on, the persistent fascination with animated children’s programming continues to rear its head on the app and across music-sharing platforms and digital service platforms (DSPs) – <em>The Backyardigans</em> has 3&nbsp;million monthly listeners on Spotify, for example.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Jerrard L, a&nbsp;data scientist and TikTok enthusiast, believes that nostalgia could be propelling the trend, a&nbsp;common occurrence in today’s world. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I think it’s nice for people to feel nostalgic and reminisce about things in the past. Sometimes those things can bring back good memories and I&nbsp;think everyone has just been wanting to think of the good things over the pandemic,” he says.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Charles <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Chizzy” Stephens III is a&nbsp;multi-platinum songwriter and producer who has worked with the likes of A$AP Ferg, <a href="https://theface.com/music/justin-bieber-intimate-show-indigo-o2-london-changes">Justin Beiber</a> and Jennifer Lopez, and also contributed to <em>Teen Titan Go!’</em>s soundtrack with <em>Catchin’ Villains</em>. As he notes, the tendency to spotlight these particular songs from cartoons isn’t only re-emerging within TikTok communities and on DSPs, but also on other social media platforms. When <em>Catching Villains</em> first aired in October 2017, a&nbsp;Facebook user <a href="https://www.facebook.com/terrell.evans.52/posts/teen-titans-then-made-a-song-that-can-make-the-billboard-dont-sleep-on-these-car/1544308885629752/">emphasised</a> the songs <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>hit” potential days after the inaugural airing, leading to a&nbsp;snippet first going viral on the social media outlet.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>After Facebook, it ended up on Twitter – it goes up there every couple of months,” Stephens says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>There’s something going on right now on Twitter, where they post what’s going on on TikTok.” As of this <a href="https://twitter.com/hulkswag85/status/1404480922691555345?s=20">month</a>, <em>Catching Villains</em> continues to procure more views across social media, as fans of all ages (re)discover the rap-infused, lighthearted creation.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="944971"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//WpbMLLm-Jsc' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="944972"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">By and large, contributors to these infamous cartoon scores aren’t solely in this role. They typically balance an array of positions, with side-hustles both on and off the show (sometimes voice acting is the side-hustle). For example, popular multi-hyphenate creator Olivia Olson, like Stephens, has gone viral with an array of sounds and cartoon-related backing tracks, such as <em>Phineas and Ferb</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s <em>Busted</em>. Most will probably remember Olson as the little girl who sung an impressive rendition of <em>All I&nbsp;Want For Christmas Is You</em> in <em>Love Actually</em>. But she’s also voiced the character of Vanessa Doofenshmirtz on <em>Phineas and Ferb</em>, and regularly lends her voice to other programmes like <em>Adventure Time</em>, while balancing a&nbsp;solo career, developing a&nbsp;cartoon series of her own and re-emerging as a&nbsp;formal actress on screen. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I feel like I&nbsp;held myself back for a&nbsp;while [from on screen acting], because of a&nbsp;lot of things in the industry,” she shares. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It would be a&nbsp;shame to not try again.” <br></p><p dir="ltr">Breaking into the cartoon space (and television at large), particularly scoring music, appears to be, like most industries, heavily reliant on networking and, in some cases, nepotism. In 2009, composer David Richard highlighted this in an article highlighting the cartoon landscape for fellow <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/cartoon-composing">creators</a>. Both Olson and Stephens, as well as Doug Wieselman – lead composer for <em>The Backyardigans</em> – landed opportunities through similar methods of luck and proximate connections. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>My first experience with TV and film was when I&nbsp;moved to LA [in 2012],” says Stephens. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I had met Bill Bergman, my mentor, through a&nbsp;songwriter in LA who I&nbsp;had been working with. She recommended me to him. From there he reached out to me and brought me in on some [television] projects.” <br></p><p dir="ltr">One of Stephens’ submissions ended up becoming the theme song to Lifetime’s <em>Bring It </em>series, which centres dance troupes across the US. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’d never been paid for music upfront before,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I did a&nbsp;couple of other scenes for the first season, but the theme song remained [across the six seasons].” <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="944973"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m not seeking notoriety or to be a&nbsp;popstar.

After encouragement from the show’s creators, Dan Povenmire and Jeff <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Swampy” Marsh, she was written into the show and subsequently lent her vocals to a&nbsp;portion of the cartoons soundtracking. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Like <em>Castaways’</em> colossal success on streaming platforms, anthems like <em>Chatchin’ Villains</em> and <em>Phineas and Ferb</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s <em>Busted</em> boast millions of streams and views in their own right. Combined, all possess more than 30-million streams across Spotify and YouTube. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Success for creators in this landscape can and does at times surpass the impact for their solo work. Olson, Stephens and Wieselman are all active soloists in their own right – Olson is gearing up to release new single <em>Crows</em> and Wieselman is working on a&nbsp;bird-related album (yes, an album literally relating to sounds from our flying feathered friends). However, in light of their success on-screen, all are content with their position as formal musicians. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>If I&nbsp;could just help people or touch people [I’d be happy]. I&nbsp;know it sounds really corny,” Oliva Olson says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m not seeking notoriety or to be a&nbsp;popstar. I&nbsp;just want to create music that makes people feel good.”</p><p dir="ltr">Doug Wieselman concurs and reiterates his appreciation for his work on <em>The Backyardigans </em>being rediscovered. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m happy because I&nbsp;think that the work that we did was really good. I’m happy that those kids who are in college now are discovering the quality of their work.”</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="944975"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed//soiw4Bh6lig' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="944976"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">The music in <em>The Backyardigans </em>is particularly significant for its infusion of genres from across the world. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>We got pretty obscure,” says Wieselman. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Greek rebetiko music and South African genres, samba, just a&nbsp;lot of really obscure things.” During its run on Nickelodeon, <em>The Backyardigans</em> earned an abundance of Emmy’s, including the 2008 Outstanding Special Class Animated Program.<br></p><p dir="ltr">Avid TikTok users like Jerrard. L&nbsp;note that the quality and sustenance behind older cartoons is particularly apparent when compared to today’s marketplace.“ I&nbsp;feel like children’s TV back in the day was a&nbsp;lot richer,” he says. But he thinks that today’s infants and youth will still have a&nbsp;wide pool of nostalgia to delve into as they grow up and reminisce in years to come. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I don’t know much about children’s TV now, but I’m sure there are some shows with cool songs or characters that will have a&nbsp;strong impact on them too.” <br></p><p dir="ltr">Social media retail executive Alex Lewis knows of one. He watches Disney’s <em>Big City Greens, </em>an animated series currently airing on the network. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>Big City Greens</em> has so many great moments in that show,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Kids will always have their own specific niche interests and be able to create their own worlds out of them that can outlive and transcend people’s current interests. There are a&nbsp;lot of people that maybe didn’t watch [<em>The Backyardigans</em>], for example, who are getting to witness the show now, in this time, because of people who had experiences with that show growing up. I&nbsp;think that as long as these platforms exist for storytelling and creation, any of those stories will be able to catch on.”<br></p><p dir="ltr">Like with most social media apps today, conversation, intrigue and trends on TikTok are able to move the pendulum forward, or indeed backward, to relive a&nbsp;moment under a&nbsp;different or amplified lens. Re-telling the past will always inevitably find an outlet – think of it as a&nbsp;virtual rumour mill. And for the creators of these songs, they can sometimes lead to more opportunities beyond the appreciation of their art. Hopefully, with time, we’ll start to see the creators of these works credited and amplified amongst the hysteria. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="944977"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

Pulling inspiration from classic 1980s and <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>90s sportswear, the French designer of the namesake brand fused Californian casuals with Parisian sophistication, presenting us with the smoothest Man On The Move. </p><p dir="ltr">There were staycation getups for the ages: fuschia shirts layered with Marant-monogrammed knitted polos worn with cream, knitted trousers and accessorised with a&nbsp;sleeping mat, reusable water bottle, and embroidered cap. Acid wash jeans with diagonal stitching were paired with cyan shirting, logoed long sleeve tops, lightweight, fleece-lined coats, and of course, portable ice packs and sun hats with neck straps.

Each outfit is completed with comfy, sporty trainers, while Marant even managed to introduce a&nbsp;socks-and-sliders combination that feels stylish – and most of all, appropriate, for spending time in the great outdoors.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="945396"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant1.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant2.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant3.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1181" height="1759" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant5.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant10.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant9.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant7.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/IsabelMarant6.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="2362" height="3517" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Photography by Iliya Lipkin</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="945397"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Layering also took centre stage.

Taking this concept, and as a&nbsp;sense of celebration, the photographs were wrapped in custom wrapping paper and feature an 18<sup class="ordinal">th</sup> century painting of a&nbsp;squirrel eating an acorn next to a&nbsp;bowl of strawberries. <em>Aww</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">The collection, then, is a&nbsp;closed-door affair – an act of self-expression, singing into a&nbsp;can of hairspray and letting loose far from the prying eyes of judgement. Carefree youth is immortalised in strong shades of acid-pink, green, yellow, electric-blue and orange for the <a href="https://theface.com/tag/menswear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Men’s collection</a>.

After shoots, he would often spend nights in the studio with his mates, but it wasn’t until NQ producer (and former rapper) WhyJay encouraged him to have a&nbsp;go in booth that he realised his rap potential.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Probably one of the first songs I&nbsp;recorded was with WhyJay, and he was like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Yo, you should just try this music thing, serious’. I&nbsp;was in the booth like, <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Shut up man.’ But I&nbsp;ended up dropping a&nbsp;few tunes and then people really did fuck with it,” SVMI remembers.</p><p dir="ltr">Two years later, SVMI is carving a&nbsp;name for himself as a&nbsp;musician. He’s now gearing up to release his new seven-track EP, <em>MA Mood. </em>He worked alongside long-term collaborator LiTek (who along with Whyjay, produced Pa Salieu and slowthai’s recent banger <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6Jg1jw9X7g"><em>Glidin’</em></a>) to develop his laidback, melodic style. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>LiTek was getting super funky with it,” SVMI says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">”</span>There [are] a&nbsp;couple tunes on the EP that I&nbsp;made like two years ago, and some towards the back end of last year,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It shows my lyrical progress as an artist.

And in place of that lush forestry was an arid, desert-like landscape of sand, broken up with stacks of booming speakers and glossy black pick-up trucks. Think: <em>Mad Max </em>in a&nbsp;techno superclub. </p><p dir="ltr">Despite the somewhat foreboding – dystopian, even – setting, Tisci was looking back to his youth, and more specifically to how music influenced the designer he is today. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>Music has played a&nbsp;big role in my life, like a&nbsp;running soundtrack and energy throughout my youth,” he said following the show, which was soundtracked by Shpongle, the English psychedelic electronic duo who rose to underground fame in the late 1990s. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>So many of my memories forged through music take me back to an incredible time when I&nbsp;was discovering myself – my voice, my identity, my creativity – and sharing my experiences with friends, and sometimes even strangers, along the way. It was like being on a&nbsp;universal journey, brought together by a&nbsp;collective sense of openness, acceptance and opportunity.”<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="944205"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry15.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry14.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry13.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry12.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry11.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry10.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Burberry9.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="864" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="944206"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Enlisting the help of his starry line-up of current collaborators – stylist <a href="https://theface.com/culture/ib-kamara-browns-editorial-a-family-affair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ib Kamara</a>, makeup artist <a href="https://theface.com/life/lyma-laser-beauty-skincare-rejuvenation-isamaya-ffrench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Isamaya Ffrench</a> and hairstylist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jawaraw/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jawara</a> – Tisci’s celebration of music saw his designs move into darker, edgier territory. </p><p dir="ltr">Faux piercings covered the noses and lips of models (notably on <a href="https://theface.com/style/katie-grand-tomo-koizumi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joan Smalls</a>, who made a&nbsp;cameo while being carried on the shoulders of a&nbsp;shirtless hunk, naturally) while the fabric du jour was <a href="https://theface.com/tag/leather-jackets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leather</a>, coming in everything from halterneck tank-tops to hoodies and trousers with cargo pant pocket tabs that fluttered in the wind.

        <![CDATA[
                    From Midsommar to Hereditary, A24 has been revitalising the horror genre over the past few years, with prestige projects that tap into our most basic fears. With the release of False Positive this Friday, the studio’s reign of terror over cinema shows no signs of slowing down.

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943684"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">It’ll be some time before we can truly assess the impact <a href="https://a24films.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A24</a> – the little company that could – has had on horror filmmaking. Right now, we’re in a&nbsp;moment, approaching the arc of the curve. Next from the stable that brought us era defining moments like <em><a href="https://theface.com/culture/how-hereditarys-milly-shapiro-has-found-a-new-audience-on-tiktok">Hereditary</a></em>, <em><a href="https://theface.com/culture/midsommar-director-ari-asters-guide-to-the-occult">Midsommar</a></em>, and last year’s alarming and disarming <em><a href="https://theface.com/culture/morfydd-clark-saint-maud-the-lord-of-the-rings-actress-interview-volume-4-issue-4">Saint Maud</a></em>, is John Lee’s intriguing body horror <em>False Positive</em>. Within an age where little seen on screen is as horrifying as the daily news agenda, A24 has distilled the essence of our most primal fears – family, relationships, our purpose, our bodies – with style and panache. And in doing so, it might have saved the genre. <br></p><p dir="ltr">It’s easy to forget, so spoiled are we now for prestige <a href="https://theface.com/tag/horror">horror</a>, just what a&nbsp;creative nadir the genre found itself in only a&nbsp;decade ago. A&nbsp;look at 2010’s most significant releases confirm the genre’s dysphoria at the turn of the decade. There was a&nbsp;raft of unnecessary remakes, like an English language take on acclaimed Swedish vampire-love-story <em>Let Me In</em> and a&nbsp;remarkably misguided reworking of <em>A&nbsp;Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. Failed attempts to recapture lightning in a&nbsp;bottle with the disappointing <em>Paranormal Activity 2</em>. And the butt end of the torture porn aesthetic that had dominated the decade prior, by way of the grotesque <em>A&nbsp;Serbian Film</em> and <em>Saw 3D</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s impossible to talk about how horror navigated its route out of these years of creative malaise without acknowledging the contributions of <a href="https://www.blumhouse.com/">Blumhouse Productions</a>. The production company was founded by Jason Blum in 2000, but it really came to prominence in 2007 with the release of Oren Peli’s found-footage classic <em>Paranormal Activity</em>. Made for a&nbsp;meagre $15,000 (£10.7k), the film grossed $193 million dollars worldwide. <em>Paranormal Activity</em> and the numerous other hits that followed – <em>Insidious</em>, <em>Sinister</em>, <em>The Purge</em> series and, most notably, the Oscar-winning <em>Get Out</em> – embodied the business model of the outfit: low budgets and creative freedom for filmmakers. Innovation most often occurs when the money men aren’t in the room.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="943708"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/https3A2F2Fcdn.sanity.io2Fimages2Fxq1bjtf42Fproduction2Fc1e4302a088bb9b2a8fbcd29ddb43f5400f3c38f-6000x2982.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="6000" height="2982" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Midsommar</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943685"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">And yet, the stable most commonly associated with horror’s revival didn’t even exist at the turn of said decade. In fact, A24 didn’t make a&nbsp;horror movie until April 2014’s <em>Under The Skin</em> (or surrealist neo noir thriller <em>Enemy</em>, released a&nbsp;month prior, depending on how ridged you are in your definition of horror, though any film that ends with a&nbsp;man sized tarantula on a&nbsp;bed must surely be in the conversation). But where Blumhouse created a&nbsp;new studio system for the genre, A24 shaped horrors’ new tone. There’s even a&nbsp;name for it, one that’s taken coverage of the New York based company into realms whereupon horror rarely treads. They call it <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Elevated Horror” – and you’re just as likely to read about it in <em>Vanity Fair</em> as you are in the timeless horror bible <em>Fangoria</em>. <br></p><p dir="ltr">If you’re a&nbsp;vintage horror fan, it’s likely this new term will irk, even annoy you. Like comic books became graphic novels and sales to people who’d never step inside a&nbsp;comic store followed, there’s a&nbsp;suspicion the <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Elevated” prefix is a&nbsp;new, not especially coordinated attempt to repackage horror as something distinct from its often sordid past. This suggests that <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>sordid” is in some way undesired, and negates the intelligence and emotional depth present within the sort of films that have been made as long as the horror genre has existed. For <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Elevated”, read complex, psychological and a&nbsp;refraction of societal fears. That sounds an awful lot like <em>The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari</em> (1920), <em>Rosemary’s Baby</em> (1968), <em>Jacobs Ladder</em> (1990) or <em>Teeth</em> (2007) to us.</p><p dir="ltr">But whether you like the <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Elevated” moniker or not, it’s unarguable that A24 are modern horror’s most prominent taste makers, certainly in the West. Founded in August 2012 by industry veterans Daniel Katz, David Fenkel and John Hodges, the very name of the company is an insight into the creative perspective at the heart of the founders vision. A24 is the Italian motorway that Katz, former head of film finance at major investors Guggenheim Partners, was driving on when he had the idea for the company. Surreptitiously, the motorway is also known as the backdrop to many of Italian cinema’s greatest surrealist pictures. A&nbsp;movie company that values art and expression over commerce – an area, it should be said, that isn’t A24’s strongest field; 2016’s <em>Moonlight</em> is one of the lowest grossing films ever to win the Oscar for Best Picture – shouldn’t be as rare as it is. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>We used to always talk about <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Oh, there’s gotta be a&nbsp;better way’,” <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/a24-studio-oral-history">Katz has said</a>, often.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="943709"><figure class=""><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/https3A2F2Fcdn.sanity.io2Fimages2Fxq1bjtf42Fproduction2F0c111da23cd9e93c648510b111615f42cae23649-3500x1466.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="3500" height="1466" ><figcaption><div class="caption"><p><em>Saint Maud</em></p></div></figcaption></div></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943686"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Doing things differently isn’t the only secret to A24’s success. The company deploys stealth data marketing startup Operam, which develops algorithms used to target potential cinema goers via social media. It’s also a&nbsp;client of web-focused marketing agency Watson/​DG. But artistry remains core to their appeal. The 360 presentation of the companies’ films have become a&nbsp;sign of quality, or at least must-see intrigue. Within the realm of horror, beginning with Robert Eggers debut feature, 2016’s supernatural period piece <em>The Witch</em>, A24’s classy, redrawn logo – a&nbsp;custom font, with Bodoni as the source – is a&nbsp;hallmark. It’s a&nbsp;sign that horror is being taken seriously within; this is appealing, when in the genre’s recent history, it so often was not. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, there’s an <a href="https://a24films.com/notes?f=Podcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A24 podcast</a> (“No host. No ads. No rules”). More surprisingly, they publish their own fanzine, while the companies limited-edition merchandise line gives texture to a&nbsp;genre of movie making often accompanied by mass produced tat. Sadly, if you’re after the 6” by 3” by 4” hand-stained pinewood <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Bear in a&nbsp;cage” from 2019’s brain busting folk horror <em>Midsommar</em>, then you’re shit out of luck. That’s long past sold out. But a&nbsp;grooming set modelled on Eggers <em>The Lighthouse</em>? If you’re quick, you can probably grab one of those. If you miss out, you can download a&nbsp;free wallpaper of the macabre craft set used by Charlie in Ari Aster’s <em>Hereditary</em>, which, at $80 million grossed on a $10 million budget, is A24’s biggest commercial hit worldwide. <br></p><p dir="ltr">Despite their big, surprising (for the cast of <em>La La Land</em>, anyway) win with <em>Moonlight</em>, A24’s luscious vision for modern horror has yet to make much impact at the Oscars, with only Jarin Blaschke’s superb cinematography in <em>The Lighthouse</em> receiving a&nbsp;cursory nod last year. This isn’t entirely surprising. Horror has long received short thrift by the Oscars, with Fredric March’s <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Best Actor” portrayal of both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 1931, <em>The Exorcist</em> sweeping the board with ten awards in 1974, acclaim for <em>Jaws</em> two years later and for <em>The Silence Of The Lambs</em> in 1992 being choice highlights. <br></p><p dir="ltr">There are signs that the times are a&nbsp;changin’. Jordan Peele’s <em>Get Out</em>, a&nbsp;superb mediation on suburban racism, won big at the 2018 Oscars. Ditto <em>The Shape Of Water</em>, more a&nbsp;monster movie than a&nbsp;horror film, but a&nbsp;cerebral one. <em>A&nbsp;Quiet Place</em> took home an award a&nbsp;year later and could have felt aggrieved at not bagging more. None of these films carry the A24 stamp of approval. And yet it’s hard to imagine any of them existing in a&nbsp;world where A24 doesn’t. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="943710"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="942551"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">When is a&nbsp;podcast not a&nbsp;podcast? This is the square that 32-year-old British writer Clive Martin has been trying to circle with his first <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>audio experience”, <em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/clivemartinhypnicjerk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hypnic Jerk</a></em>. Wandering, sleepy, and a&nbsp;little off-kilter, <em>Hypnic Jerk</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s 45-minute missives are, in Martin’s words, all about <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>dread and uncertainty.” </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>I say it all the time on the show,” Martin says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I don’t know why I’m doing it, but for some reason I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;have to.” </p><p dir="ltr">Martin is the show’s Voice of God. Each episode begins with an original thematic essay, on everything from the cult of lifestyle journalism, to Britain’s relationship with Europe through the lens of the interrail scheme. After these short essay reads, Martin invites a&nbsp;guest on for a&nbsp;loose, free-form conversation with only the vaguest connection to the episode’s theme. </p><p dir="ltr">As a&nbsp;result, <em>Hypnic Jerk</em> has a&nbsp;similar ambient quality to the classic talk radio style of NPR, America’s highbrow public radio station. But Martin’s inspiration came from closer to home. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I remember, as a&nbsp;child, being in the car on long night trips across the country to see family. As we passed through different areas, we’d tune into all these different local call-in shows, hosted by strange, King-of-the-County DJs, and they fascinated me.”</p><p dir="ltr">He is now king of his own carved-out domain, building what he self-deprecatingly calls <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>an empire” on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/clivemartinhypnicjerk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a>, combining <em>Hypnic Jerk</em> with a&nbsp;weekly newsletter, <em>Garlic Is Not A&nbsp;Perfume</em>, and an open slot for more projects. He hasn’t always been so prolific, or so open. </p><p dir="ltr">Martin first rose to prominence during London’s first big new media boom at the turn of the tens, as Vice’s accidental starman and staff writer. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’d just been kicked out of uni – London Met, the worst uni in the country, according to the tables, and the very next day, no word of a&nbsp;lie, an editor/​drinking acquaintance of mine asked me if I’d ever considered writing. I&nbsp;hadn’t, but I&nbsp;went for it anyway.”<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="942552"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’d be brought into TV meetings and they’d pitch ideas to turn me into Mark Dolan from Balls of Steel”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="942553"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Martin bristles at this bit of serendipity. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I feel guilty, in a&nbsp;way, because that wouldn’t happen anymore – there are loads of kids who would’ve jumped at that chance, and I&nbsp;didn’t seek it out.” </p><p dir="ltr">Upon landing at <em>Vice</em> on a&nbsp;casual basis, Martin spotted the site’s nascent clubbing series, <em>Big Night Out</em>, and asked if he could take it over. It would be, for better or worse, the making of him. Through his wry, fish-out-of-water dispatches from the weird and wacky fringes of British clubland, Martin caught on, moving swiftly from articles to video to the lead late-night show on Viceland at the channel’s launch in 2016.</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout this rise was a&nbsp;deep, irrepressible sense of alienation; a&nbsp;sense of stumbling backward into a&nbsp;world he had never asked to be in, and never aspired to break into. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I was losing control of my creativity, my identity, my ambitions,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’d be brought into TV meetings and they’d pitch ideas to turn me into Mark Dolan from <em>Balls of Steel</em>: some bumbling, middle-class Englishman in unfamiliar situations, acting all awkward and weird.” Batting off bad ideas with increasing exhaustion, Martin grew more and more resentful of the media landscape he found himself in.</p><p dir="ltr">Things came to a&nbsp;head one hungover morning when, getting off at Angel station, he saw an advert for Viceland’s <em>Big Night Out</em> on a&nbsp;phone box, with his face front-and-centre. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>There I&nbsp;am, looking back at myself, and thinking <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>this was never meant to happen, I&nbsp;didn’t want this.’ I&nbsp;didn’t handle it well, to be honest. It’s a&nbsp;very odd, cosmically damaging thing to happen, and I’ve been pulling away from it ever since.”</p><p dir="ltr">Burned out by London, expectation, and the strains of his accidental career, Martin packed his bags and left, for what he describes in coded terms as <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>a neutral space” in England – <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>somewhere with multiplexes and average Italian restaurants, where people aren’t living there as some kind of status signifier.” For a&nbsp;year, he idled – reading, running, walking the dog, processing the whirlwind he’d been flung out of. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>It was good for my brain, I&nbsp;needed it.”</p><p dir="ltr">He also became far choosier with his projects, picking up a&nbsp;straight job to pay the bills so he could write what he wanted, when he wanted, at his own pace. The most ambitious of these was a&nbsp;semi-fictionalised story published by <em>Vice</em>, titled <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/d338jj/a-strange-summer-lived-through-a-barrage-of-online-content"><em>The Idiot</em></a>, where Martin – unmoored from the need to give cultural commentary or clubland reportage – wrote honestly and macabrely about himself and the disaffection that led to him leaving the capital. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="942554"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I might be an egomaniac as well, but at least I’m pretentious enough to try and not be”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="942555"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">When read today, you can see how <em>Hypnic Jerk</em><span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>s opening monologues emerged from them. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I hadn’t ever written about myself like that before,” he tells me. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>They’re not confessional but they are personal.” The process of writing <em>The Idiot</em> opened Martin up to making sense of his past through writing his way out of it, as opposed to punching in opinions about questions he had no answers to. Best of all, it allowed him to regain the control he’d been chasing. </p><p dir="ltr">Martin is, at this point, evangelical about subscriber media as an antidote to the take economy that precipitated his burnout. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Say what you want about those big American podcasts,” he says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m no superfan, but they’re uneditorialised, creative, and speak directly to their audience – they’re the new magazines.” </p><p dir="ltr"><em>Hypnic Jerk</em> doesn’t have any need to fit into a&nbsp;genre or satisfy advertisers. And with that, Martin’s writing for the show is as acerbic and perceptive as ever. His highs and lows, the retreats and returns, are just good anecdotes now, there to be tied into themes of his choosing, for the enjoyment of the late-night drifters who have tuned into his radio station. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>As I&nbsp;said before, this isn’t confessional,” he assures me. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>There are already too many egomaniacs out there, using national newspapers as their personal diary. I&nbsp;mean, I&nbsp;might be an egomaniac as well, but at least I’m pretentious enough to try and not be.”<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="942556"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p><em>Hypnic Jerk is available to listen now via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/clivemartinhypnicjerk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patreon</a></em></p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>

                    With some workers logging 100 hours’ overtime in a month, and “karoshi" – death by overworking – a common trope, Japan hopes to change the narrative and fight back for workplace freedom. We say yes.

                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943157"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Somehow, someway, somewhere, a&nbsp;five-day week – with just two days to kick off your boots – was implemented. That was someone’s idea. And that person hadn’t worked a&nbsp;day in their life. Bloody capitalism. Bloody rich people. Bloody nonsense.</p><p dir="ltr">But now, after centuries of suffering and Sunday evenings spent plaintively wondering <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span><em>why me?”</em>, countries are fighting back. Fighting for freedom and fighting for their livelihoods by introducing the four-day week.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems like a&nbsp;bold move, doesn’t it? To erase years of unquestionable tradition. But with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/15/spain-to-launch-trial-of-four-day-working-week">Spain, New Zealand, Germany and Denmark proposing the four-dayer</a>, it could become a&nbsp;reality – and one that Japan, where workers took only <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200114-how-the-japanese-are-putting-an-end-to-death-from-overwork">52.4 per cent of entitled paid holiday</a> in 2018, could follow pretty soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Political leaders are attempting to rattle the nerves of workaholic managers and overzealous CEOs, waving a&nbsp;flag for the enhanced benefits of reduced and flexible working hours: increased focus, efficiency and deadlines met. Less resentment towards your boss, more time to do stuff, rebuilding a&nbsp;zest for life you waved goodbye to at 18.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.dw.com/en/japan-work-life-balance/a-57989053">According to <em>DW</em></a>, the newly unveiled annual economic policy guidelines includes recommendations to companies that will permit staff to simply say <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>no, I’d rather have a&nbsp;life than work for The Man” by opting to work four days a&nbsp;week instead of five. Go on, Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">In the campaign, the government in Tokyo teases the splendid benefits by telling companies they will be able to retain staff more effectively, with the one fewer working day allowing parents to raise a&nbsp;family or take care of elderly relatives.</p><p dir="ltr">Equally, it will hopefully encourage workers to spread their wings and gain additional educational qualifications, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>or even take on side jobs in addition to their regular employment” – which surely defeats the point of a&nbsp;four-dayer entirely?Anyway. One step at at time.</p><p dir="ltr">In the (we hope) tail-end of the pandemic, the Japanese government are hoping the one extra day off will encourage people to go out and spend their hard-earned cash and boost the economy, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56066065">where it shrunk by 4.8 per cent last year</a> – “[Japan’s] worst post-war quarterly contraction between April and June,” according to the BBC. </p><p dir="ltr">On top of all the helpful economic stuff: as the young have become born-again virgins and social dinosaurs in the past year, the four-day proposal also aims to give the young an opportunity to meet, shag, marry and have kids, as a&nbsp;way to propel <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/east-asia/japan-birth-rate-covid-babies-b1859739.html">the country’s falling birth rate</a>, where it’s at a&nbsp;record low.</p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>The government is really very keen for this change in attitude to take root at Japanese companies,” Martin Schulz, chief policy economist for Fujitsu Ltd’s Global Market Intelligence Unit, <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/japan-work-life-balance/a-57989053">told <em>DW</em></a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, on a&nbsp;more solemn note, the Japanese population has long-suffered illnesses and, in some cases, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200114-how-the-japanese-are-putting-an-end-to-death-from-overwork">death</a>, as a&nbsp;result of overworking, known as <em>karoshi</em> (literally, death by overwork). In <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/karoshi-japan-overwork-culture">a&nbsp;report by <em>Wired</em></a> this year, it found the Japanese government accepts 200 workplace injury claims for <em>karoshi</em> annually, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>but campaigners have put the toll at around 10,000 deaths”.</p><p dir="ltr">All things considered, with working up to 100&nbsp;hours of overtime in a&nbsp;month still legal, the proposal of a&nbsp;four-day weekend in Japan sounds like a&nbsp;huge milestone.</p><p dir="ltr">Get a&nbsp;life. Save a&nbsp;life. Love your life. Introduce the four-dayer. </p><p dir="ltr">Right, I’m clocking off now.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="943500"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

Now resident in Los Angeles, the South Sudanese-Australian megawatt model’s break was walking for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yves_Saint_Laurent_(brand)">Saint Laurent</a> SS17. She’s since graced covers for British<em> Vogue</em> and <em>Numéro </em>and, closing Chanel’s Haute Couture AW18 show as their bride, was the first Black model to do so since 2004. Now, in and around charity work with the United Nations, Akech has squeezed in her latest role: the newest Global Brand Ambassador for Estée Lauder. Here we get the scoop on the 21-year-old’s skincare secrets, work-out regime and how she spends her downtime.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--instagram-embed " data-block="943089"><div class="content-builder__block--xs content-builder__block--instagram-inner"><iframe width="320" height="320" frameBorder="0" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKSKPHrBCU4/" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943090"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>I wake up at… </strong>It depends what time I&nbsp;go to sleep the night before. I’m not a&nbsp;morning person! I&nbsp;would love to say that I&nbsp;am, but I’m just not! </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The first thing I&nbsp;do is</strong>… Pray. Every morning.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>My skincare regimen in the morning is</strong>… Simple! Taking care of my skin is the most important thing and I’ve found that a&nbsp;simple routine is best for me. Cleanser, moisturiser (with SPF) and lip balm.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>My favourite morning products are</strong>…<a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/681/61891/product-catalog/skincare/daywear/anti-oxidant-72h-hydration-sorbet-creme-spf-15"> Estée Lauder DayWear Anti-Oxidant 72H-Hydration Sorbet Creme SPF 15</a> and <a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/637/34319/product-catalog/makeup/eyes/mascara/little-black-primertm/tint-amplify-set">Estée Lauder Little Black Primer.</a></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>My worst beauty habits are… </strong>I&nbsp;have no problem moisturising my face, I&nbsp;never skip a&nbsp;night. But I&nbsp;could do a&nbsp;better job moisturising the rest of my body.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>My favourite feature is my…</strong> Lips. When I&nbsp;was younger, I&nbsp;was told my lips were too big. But now I&nbsp;love them! I’ve learned to embrace them and appreciate them. And now everyone wants bigger lips!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>My first beauty-related memory is… </strong>When I&nbsp;moved to Australia and I&nbsp;saw my mum and sister’s makeup products. I&nbsp;remember playing with lipsticks and eyeshadows and becoming mesmerised with these magical products. </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Where are you headed today?</strong> I’m at my favourite lunch spot in LA with friends right now. I&nbsp;brought my laptop with me so when we are finished, you can still find me sitting here working away! </p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What tasks have you got to get done? </strong>I&nbsp;have a&nbsp;couple of calls to make to catch up with some people. My most important call today is to a&nbsp;furniture company. I&nbsp;ordered a&nbsp;new couch a&nbsp;couple months ago and it came with a&nbsp;missing piece. I’m finally just getting around to request a&nbsp;replacement, I’ve been so busy!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you work out?</strong> I&nbsp;don’t work every day, I’d be lying if I&nbsp;said I&nbsp;did! But I&nbsp;try to work out a&nbsp;few days a&nbsp;week. I&nbsp;have been doing a&nbsp;lot of cardio lately, and booty and ab workouts.</p><p><strong>Are you taking any supplements? </strong>I&nbsp;take my vitamins every day. All the ones that are important to take: Vitamin B, B12, C, collagen and a&nbsp;supplement gummy for hair, nails and skin.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--instagram-embed " data-block="943091"><div class="content-builder__block--xs content-builder__block--instagram-inner"><iframe width="320" height="320" frameBorder="0" src="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNECYwjh_Fz/" frameborder="0"></iframe></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943092"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>What’s for lunch and why?</strong> Right now, I’m eating Short Rib eggs Benedict and potato bites.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What’s your evening routine?</strong> It depends on what I’ve been doing that day. If I&nbsp;am working, I&nbsp;will get home and just relax. I&nbsp;live in Los Angeles now, so my nighttime is daytime in Australia, where my family is. So every night, I’m usually talking to family and friends there before they start their days.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you relax?</strong> I&nbsp;come home from work, change into some comfy clothes, like loungewear, then just lay around. I&nbsp;watch some YouTube or TV.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you listen to anything in the evening?</strong> If I’m struggling to fall asleep, I’ll put on a&nbsp;sleep playlist on Apple Music. It’s these soft, soothing sounds that will play all through the night.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Burn any candles? Have a&nbsp;bath?</strong> I&nbsp;love candles and always have one burning when I&nbsp;am home. I&nbsp;don’t like anything with too strong of a&nbsp;scent. I&nbsp;prefer a&nbsp;calming candle scent. I&nbsp;take a&nbsp;bath every now and then. I&nbsp;would love to take one every night, and most of the days, but I&nbsp;just don’t have enough time!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What products do you use at night?</strong> I&nbsp;like to use the <a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/681/39476/product-catalog/skincare/advanced-night/micro-cleansing-balm">Estée Lauder Advanced Night Micro Cleansing Balm</a> to remove my makeup. I&nbsp;love this balm because it melts into an oil and gets all my makeup off.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What skincare products do you swear by?</strong> I&nbsp;love to use masks when my skin needs extra hydration, especially when I’ve been travelling or working a&nbsp;lot. I&nbsp;love the <a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/681/35783/product-catalog/skincare/advanced-night-repair/concentrated-recovery-powerfoil-mask">Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair PowerFoil Mask.</a></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What’s the best beauty hack you’ve ever learned and why?</strong> It sounds simple but my makeup artist recently applied my moisturiser with a&nbsp;sponge. I&nbsp;liked the way it felt and had never thought to do that so now I&nbsp;do the same.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What’s the last product you apply before you sleep? </strong>My <a href="https://www.esteelauder.co.uk/product/631/74435/product-catalog/makeup/pure-color-envy/nighttime-rescue-lip-oil-serum">Estée Lauder Pure Color Envy Nighttime Rescue Lip Oil-Serum</a>. It leaves my lips so soft and smooth when I&nbsp;wake up in the morning.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bedtime is at… </strong>On a&nbsp;good day, my bedtime is usually around 11pm.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How do you sleep… </strong>Not great! If I’m away working and not in my own bed, I&nbsp;can’t get comfortable for the first two, three nights. But if I’m in my own bed, I&nbsp;sleep just fine.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I’ve been dreaming of… </strong>The world opening up so I&nbsp;can go home and see my family and friends in Australia!<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="943491"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

At the time, I&nbsp;was British number one and the fastest woman in the UK. Although it was hard to admit that my body wasn’t going to be ready in time, I&nbsp;had to pull out of selection. </p><p>But I&nbsp;didn’t just pick myself up and run away. I&nbsp;sat in the stadium on the night that I&nbsp;was meant to be competing. That was when I&nbsp;got approached to do a&nbsp;bit of punditry – and I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;taste for it. </p><p>Since hanging up my spikes that year and officially retiring in 2014, I’ve been lucky to be a&nbsp;part of the <a href="https://theface.com/life/football-sport-womens-world-cup-hackney-london-volume-4-issue-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">women’s sport</a> movement as a&nbsp;journalist and broadcaster, amplifying voices on my weekly radio show and in print. You find extraordinary stories. </p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="943313"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>Back when I&nbsp;was an athlete, we didn’t have the accessibility of social media, where you can make statements that can go viral. If you needed to be heard, your statements had to be bigger and bolder. That might have meant wearing a&nbsp;particular T‑shirt on a&nbsp;race day, when you knew you were going to be visible or speaking to the papers. </p><p>Now, hard-working women in <a href="https://theface.com/tag/sport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sport</a> are paving the way and using their platforms to speak out in an industry that, for so many years, has been dominated by men. To me, that’s massively inspirational.</p><p>It made me think about women who stood out from the crowd, such as the incredible talent on the following pages: canoeist Kimberley Woods, sprinter Imani Lansiquot, rower Kyra Edwards, shooter Ruth Mwandumba, swimmer Alice Dearing and Celia Quansah, who’s bringing a&nbsp;vibrancy from track and field into rugby. They all prove that British athletics has the power to influence and empower a&nbsp;younger generation.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--styling-section " data-block="943314"><div class="styling-section styling-section--decontain styling-section--paddingOnTopAndBottom styling-section--noMargin"

        <![CDATA[
                    <div class="content-builder"><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939382"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">It was announced late last year that Y/Project’s creative director Glenn Martens would add Diesel to his CV, a&nbsp;move prompted by his unnerving attention to (denim) detail, aerodynamic form and sensual shape. Since 2013, his work at Y/​Project turned the brand into a&nbsp;commercially viable yet conceptual go-to for party-loving millennials and A‑list celebrities alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Now creative director of the Italian label, it seems Martens has spared no time breathing a&nbsp;long-awaited stroke of radicality and optimism into Diesel with his debut SS22 collection, presented today through a&nbsp;short film by filmmaker <a href="https://www.instagram.com/frankleboner/">Frank LeBon</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Martens’ turn is sexy, experimental and, for want of a&nbsp;better word, blindingly cool. As expected, given the Belgian designer’s past appreciation for denim, Diesel’s core isn’t overlooked. Rather, it’s spun around in unusual mediums, taking form in draped, asymmetric skirts, double-fronted jeans (a Y/​Project evolution) and ultra-tight cycling shorts. For the brand’s history of producing denim as, well, denim, Martens’ reincarnation is to offer a&nbsp;product the avant-garde fanbase he has amassed will equally love, too.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="939383"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHUo-X86NCk' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939384"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">In a&nbsp;forward-facing move, Diesel has introduced Diesel Library – a&nbsp;sustainable collection component of genderless items including jeans, skirts and shirts with a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>made to last” approach. Diesel has never been luxury per se, but it would seem Martens is spearheading the method of building a&nbsp;pair of jeans that, at a&nbsp;decent price, should last a&nbsp;lifetime. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>This launch marks a&nbsp;major step in Martens’ evolution of Diesel,” the press release notes, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>continuing its position as a&nbsp;power player in defining the culture.”</p><p dir="ltr">Further into the collection, highlights include shape-shifting accents, like interwoven belts holding T‑shirts, dresses and miniskirts together through smart cutouts, anchoring pieces to make one innovative drape. Lighters, phones and credit cards are to be stored in the five-pocket denim trousers, morphing into either sewn-in cowboy or pointed-toe heeled boots. Jersey pieces are cut, sewn, dyed and reimagined into jumpers and bombers, like a&nbsp;ribbed-sleeve denim jacket or classic black leather jacket worn oversized and nodding to Diesel’s functional beginnings.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="939385"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-075.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-045.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-044.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-024.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-056.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-055.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-071_DETAIL-002.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-054.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-043.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-032.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-031.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-016.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-012.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-007.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-004.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-001.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/SS22_LOOK-073_2021-06-21-154650.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="1300" height="1950" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939386"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>But Martens’ giddiness for the outlandish are the real standouts in this stellar debut: smocked organza pieces trickled throughout, with cracked paint motifs on an ankle-length skirt, a&nbsp;sizeable overcoat in splattered blues, reds and whites, and a&nbsp;bomber that, on first-look, resembles a&nbsp;tiled mosaic.<br><br>At a&nbsp;time when we need it most, optimism is the <em>tour de force</em>.

Released last year, her debut album <em>Source</em> is a&nbsp;sonic journey across the African diaspora, exploring her Guyanese and British Trinidadian heritage through adventurous compositions that sound at once thoroughly modern and timeless.</p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--embed-code " data-block="939194"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/CkKuJ00m4zU' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939195"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Now starring in Bottega Veneta’s Wardrobe 02 campaign, she’s caught the attention of the fashion crowd, too. Donning a&nbsp;wet-weather-ready look of colour-blocked leather and bright green puddle boots, Garcia was one of 30 influential figures chosen for the campaign, alongside the likes of Skepta, Neneh Cherry and Little Simz.</p><p dir="ltr">Here, THE FACE catches up with Nubya Garcia over Zoom to find out more about her music and personal style, and why Beyoncé will <em>always</em> be a&nbsp;source of inspiration.</p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939196"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hey Nubya, how are you doing?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">I’m good, thank you. I’ve been looking at the rain this morning, pottering about. There’s some stuff I&nbsp;have to do, but we’re fine.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How would you describe your sound?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">My style is a&nbsp;mixture of lots of different things, which is so vague, but it’s just true. I&nbsp;think people see a&nbsp;saxophone and they’re like, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Oh, yeah, it’s jazz or it’s reggae”. No, it’s a&nbsp;mixture of lots of different things that me and my friends and my family have been exposed to over the years. It’s ever-changing as well, which is really exciting. <br></p><p dir="ltr">I’m honoured to be called a&nbsp;jazz musician [by others] – I&nbsp;longed for that for so long. But I’m [also] really wary of being called a&nbsp;jazz musician… I’ve just left the box of trying to please everyone in terms of, <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>You’re not jazz because you don’t do this”. I&nbsp;wanted to be thought of as a&nbsp;jazz musician, but I’m also very different from other jazz musicians who are deep in the art form and uphold the tradition in a&nbsp;very different way than I&nbsp;do. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So what </strong><strong><em>does</em></strong><strong> jazz mean to you? </strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">It means so much that I&nbsp;can’t articulate it properly. I&nbsp;don’t feel confident enough to stand by what I&nbsp;say, because it’s ever-changing and feels so powerful to me. And there’s such a&nbsp;history and rhetoric about jazz being miscommunicated that I&nbsp;don’t want to add to that story. I&nbsp;will say, for me, it’s just something that has helped me. It’s provided me with a&nbsp;space to be myself and learn who the fuck that is. The music just provides me with a&nbsp;space to be free and explore things that I&nbsp;can’t articulate in words.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="939197"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>I’m honoured to be called a&nbsp;jazz musician, but I’m also really wary of it”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939198"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>What do you think about when putting together an outfit for a&nbsp;performance?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Often I&nbsp;go for clothes that I&nbsp;can move in, because I&nbsp;don’t like to be constricted on stage. You have to think about how hot then you might be, if there’s any AC. It’s so dumb, but I’ve done gigs where I’m wearing [a tight long sleeve top] like this and just got the biggest sweat patches. You feel really unattractive, you know? I’m not like <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>I must be perfect all the time”, because God damn, playing music is really sweaty. But I&nbsp;have to be comfortable, I&nbsp;have to feel powerful. <br></p><p dir="ltr">These days, I&nbsp;like jeans and a&nbsp;T‑shirt, or a&nbsp;top with combat trousers and comfy Converse or big boots. I&nbsp;used to really try – I&nbsp;mean, I&nbsp;do still definitely try, but I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;have less to prove. Unfortunately, I&nbsp;also think about how I&nbsp;come across with what I&nbsp;wear, because I&nbsp;don’t want to be over-sexualized. Now, I&nbsp;think I’ve figured out what works for me and what I&nbsp;feel comfortable in. On a&nbsp;casual day, I&nbsp;have these yellow combat trousers that I&nbsp;wear with big boots and a&nbsp;small body top. I’ve also got this really amazing shirt from Nor Black Nor White, which is patterned. I&nbsp;wore that for my only show of 2020 at the Barbican. <br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How would you describe your day-to-day style?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Growing up, I&nbsp;was really interested in fashion and I&nbsp;thought about pursuing that before music. My personal style is mixed between being incredibly lazy and all or nothing. I&nbsp;love to dress up and look good, but the regularity of that is going down. I&nbsp;go for comfort and uniqueness now. I&nbsp;used to be all about the high street, but I&nbsp;think the high street used to be way more interesting, [more] colourful and bright. Over the last decade, it’s just become really bland.<br></p><p dir="ltr">I love one-off pieces. I&nbsp;love going away and meeting people who make clothes on all kinds of levels and popularities. I&nbsp;always end up coming home with something that feels like a&nbsp;story. That’s what I&nbsp;really love about fashion, remembering where you got something or who you were talking to when you bought a&nbsp;piece.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Who are your fashion heroes from the world of music?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Absolutely Beyoncé. I&nbsp;would never wear [her outfits], because nobody needs to see my legs. I&nbsp;think she’s incredible all round, but the outfits and the attention to detail… I&nbsp;was at her [2018] Coachella show and seeing that beginning outfit with the cape, I&nbsp;was like <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">‘</span>Yoo!’ She is an absolute style icon. So there’s her, and obviously Prince and Miles Davis, even though I’m personally quite understated.<br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--pull-quote " data-block="939199"><div class="content-builder__block--l"><div class="pullquote "><div class="pullquote__body "><blockquote class="pullquote__quote"><p><span class="pull-double">“</span>One day, I’d love to do a&nbsp;visual album, it’s just so difficult when you’re not a&nbsp;multimillionaire music icon”</p></blockquote></div></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939200"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do other visual elements of music, like album covers and videos, influence you?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Definitely. I&nbsp;love designing artwork and working with artists on creative direction, because it can bring so much in. There’s so much in my last <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CCshDqbJJw7/">album cover</a>. I&nbsp;spoke so much [to Claire Laura, the artist] and she just really got that what I&nbsp;was trying to create. I&nbsp;think all cover designs bring something to the music that can’t be articulated in words. You form these opinions about the music before you’ve even heard it, because you look at the cover. Sometimes they match and sometimes they don’t, and I&nbsp;love that kind of conversation between the two. Loads of old school dub albums have incredible covers. You can just see the journey.<br></p><p dir="ltr">In terms of music videos that have influenced me, they’re quite recent, but I&nbsp;really love the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHGf6tmnLYE">last</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxfGQ2AJHGk">two</a> Little Simz videos. Those are just incredible – the detail, the representation and diversity, the story, the narrative. There’s obviously Beyoncé too – I&nbsp;should probably stop talking about her! I&nbsp;think she’s so inspiring. One day, I’d love to do a&nbsp;visual album, it’s just so difficult when you’re not a&nbsp;multimillionaire music icon.<br></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One day! Imagine it’s not raining outside… What are your summer style essentials?</strong><br></p><p dir="ltr">Well, I’m a&nbsp;new Birkenstock lover, so a&nbsp;good pair of Birkenstocks or other sandals, or my trusty white leather Converse for those rainy summer days. A&nbsp;pair of jean shorts, a&nbsp;simple colourful top and a&nbsp;nice summer dress that you can dress up or dress down. I&nbsp;love it when I&nbsp;see people walking down the street in beautiful colourful dresses or shirts. We really don’t wear enough colour! I&nbsp;also like a&nbsp;really stylish pair of sunglasses and I’m a&nbsp;cap lover. They make me feel contained and they’re not as casual as they used to be. I&nbsp;still feel like I’m showing up and showing out in a&nbsp;cap and a&nbsp;summer dress. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="939201"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

Jenny*, 38, from London, explains that while she is married and had no intention to meet anyone, she couldn’t help but eye up her nurse. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>He was very handsome,” she says. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>He asked me to stay there for 15&nbsp;minutes so he could check for any side effects. Instead, I&nbsp;ended up staying for half an hour. If I&nbsp;was single, I&nbsp;could have asked for a&nbsp;date.”</p><p dir="ltr">So could vaccination centres around the world be the new meet-cutes? Only time will tell if it really could be love at first jab. If TikTok is anything to go by, the answer is yes, with a&nbsp;slew of creators speaking out about finding love at vaccine centres. Either way, it would make a&nbsp;great wedding speech. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--read-this-next " data-block="939466"><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alpinejs/alpine@v2.x.x/dist/alpine.min.js"></script><script>

Not this time, though. With her ode to the summery, sun-dappled bliss of an Italian day at the beach for SS22, produced, of course, alongside her collaborator <a href="https://theface.com/style/raf-simons-goes-back-to-the-future" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raf Simons</a>, her outlook was as clear as the crystal blue Sardinian waters that served as a&nbsp;ravishing backdrop to their latest menswear offering. </p><p dir="ltr"><span class="pull-double">“</span>This collection and this show is very much about capturing that, the joy of the everyday. The notion that living your life can be a&nbsp;euphoric experience,” Ms. Prada said. <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>Much joy can come out of something so simple: when times are complicated, we are searching for simple, direct joys.” Or, as the words that flashed at the beginning of the show read: a <span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>utopia of normality”.<br></p></div></div></div><div style="width: 100%; padding-left:20px;"><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-BespokeMobile-Article-High --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539270978-0' class="ad-margin--mobile-article-high" data-ad="bespokeMobileArticleHigh"></div><!-- /22091917356/ZStaging-InArticle --><div id='div-gpt-ad-1598539025217-0' class="ad-margin--in-article" data-ad="inArticle"></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="938997"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada6.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada5.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada4.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada3.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada2.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="938998"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p>So what exactly did Prada and Simons’s vision of utopia look like? Well, at first, not very utopian at all. Models began by stalking what appeared to be the anonymous corridors of a&nbsp;spaceship, here in an arresting blood red. But for the show’s second act, their army of lithe young men emerged into the sunlight, wading into the sparkling seas or lounging on floating jetties painted the same shade of red, this time appearing not so much menacing as a&nbsp;joyful explosion of colour, that was echoed throughout the collection from acid greens to buttercup yellows.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the clothes, the <a href="https://theface.com/tag/prada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prada</a> guy now wears short shorts in just about every variety imaginable. Seeking something crisp and classic? Look no further than the thigh-skimming pairs in rich jewel tones, featuring a&nbsp;chic silver belt buckle with the Prada logo. Something more casual? Multiple pairs came with chunkily rolled-up bottoms, perfect for a&nbsp;quick splash in the water to cool off. Something to slip on for an easy-breezy full look? Put your trust in romper suits cut from light, airy cottons and decorated with tattoo-like motifs. There has already been much talk of the impending <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/summer-2021-body-conscious-revealing-fashion-trend" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span class="push-double"></span>​<span class="pull-double">“</span>summer of skin”</a>, even as recently as the <a href="https://theface.com/style/fendi-mens-ss22-milan-fashion-week-silvia-venturini-fendi-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fendi show on Saturday</a> with its ab-baring reveals; it seems that Prada and Simons are firmly on-board with this trend, too. <br></p></div></div></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--images " data-block="938999"><figure class="flatplan-gallery"><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada13.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada12.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada11.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada10.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada9.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada8.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure><figure class="flatplan-gallery-item"><div><img src="https://images.thefacecdn.com/images/Prada7.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=focalpoint&amp;fp-x=0.5&amp;fp-y=0.5" width="608" height="1080" ><figcaption></figcaption></div></figure></figure></div><div class="content-builder__block content-builder__block--body " data-block="939000"><div class="content-builder__block--m"><div class="copy    copy--m@m"><p dir="ltr">Elsewhere, instantly desirable knapsacks and bucket bags were asking to be stuffed with towels and sun lotion for a&nbsp;day out at the beach, while bucket hats came with the additional practical feature by way of slots to hook in the ears of your sunglasses. Terrycloth hoodies were printed with novelty floral patterns recalling beach towels. More broadly, the prints appeared to pay tribute to Prada collections of years past, as Simons has been wont to do since he joined the house last year (he’s clearly enjoyed digging into the archives as much as any of us would.) <br><br>Retro, loosely <span class="push-single"></span>​<span class="pull-single">’</span>50s prints recalled the patterns inspired by Formica tiles from the house’s SS96 collection, while the array of nautical motifs including octopi, anchors and sirens, as well as the knits which featured almost corset-like lace-up details, felt like a&nbsp;gentle nod to the men’s and women’s collections of AW16, which took its cues from an underground world of sailors and pirates.</p><p dir="ltr">Most charming, however, was the spirit of positivity that so clearly underpinned the collection. While each of the shows staged by Simons and Prada for the house thus far have thrilled in their own, unique way, this felt like the first time both were ready to fully let loose and have some fun together. The overall effect was something that blended the nostalgic joy of splashing at the beach with something a&nbsp;little more cheeky – even, dare we say it, given Prada’s typically more utilitarian-buttoned-up-instincts sexy. And as the first proper summer holiday season in a&nbsp;year quickly approaches, there’s certainly nothing wrong with that. <br></p></div></div></div></div>                ]]>
