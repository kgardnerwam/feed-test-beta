Young Quebecers largely aren't religious, don't care for boomers' legacy, and out of everyone in the country, are the least emotionally attached to Canada, according to an Angus Reid and Cardus <a href="https://angusreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2021.11.10_Young_Leaders_tables.pdf" target="_blank">survey</a>.</p><p>The purpose of the survey was to collect "polling data that is focused on faith in public life," Ray Pennings, Executive Vice President at Cardus, told MTL Blog.</p><p>He said the think tank was "particularly interested in the role of faith as it affected politics, public policy, tolerance, religious freedom." </p><p>While the study focused on the national overview, we asked Pennings where Quebecers stood on religion, the legacy of Baby Boomers and their emotional attachment to Canada.</p><blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-tweet"  data-twitter-tweet-id="1458478792754614281"

        <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><h2>Religion</h2><p>"When it comes to religious tolerance, there's a greater intensity of negative views of religion among older Quebecers than younger Quebecers," Pennings explained. </p><p>"Older Quebecers are more hostile to religion and public life than our younger Quebecers."</p><p>Overall, Quebecers old and young were found to have "harsher views" of Judaism, Islam and Hinduism compared with Canadians.</p><p>The survey results show that 76% of all Quebecers think we should "keep god and religion completely out of public life."</p><p>"I get the sense that there's less religiosity in Quebec," Pennings said. </p><p>In fact, only 5% of Quebecers polled read a religious text or attended a religious service the previous week.</p><p>"Those numbers are close to double or are more than double in the rest of the country," said Pennings.</p><h2>Baby Boomers</h2><p>Young Quebecers take an overall negative view of the legacy of Baby Boomers, according to Pennings. He said their feelings about the oft-derided generation are similar to the Canadian average.</p><p>Nationally, 66% of people aged 18 to 29 and 56% of people aged 30 to 40 reported a negative view of how Boomers have left the world.</p><p>36% of all Canadians and 34% of Quebecers, specifically, had a net negative view of Boomers.</p><p>As for Canadians' opinions of the next generation's potential, Pennings said Quebecers were "a little more optimistic about what Millennials can do" compared to the rest of the country.</p><p>Only 37% of Quebec survey respondents of all ages said they expected Millennials to leave things "in worse shape" than Baby Boomers — compared to a 43% national average. </p><p>Young Quebecers also seemed to have slightly more confidence in their existing systems. </p><p>When asked whether we as a society should "[build] on the achievements of past generations," "fix" their mistakes or just "[start] new and [restructure] society differently," only 32% of young Quebecers favoured starting over — that's compared to 36% nationally, Pennings said.</p><p>"They seemed to have a stronger sense of agency."</p><h2>Canadian Pride</h2><p>Maybe this won't surprise some of you, but according to Pennings, "young Quebecers are the least attached of anyone in Canada, just 35% say they've got a 'deep emotional attachment'" to the country.</p><p>That's a 27% difference from the national average, according to the results of the poll.</p><p>Overall, Pennings said the poll suggests we could be in for a dramatic shift in the management of the country, not unlike the changes Canada saw between the 60s and the 70s.</p><p>"I think what this poll shows is that if we take a look at Canada as a whole, the next generation views a whole host of issues quite differently than their predecessors and the likely consequences of that is that we will see some significant changes in our social structures in the decades to come." </p>]]></content:encoded><featured:image>https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODAyMjY5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4MTM5NzkxMH0.2OJNNiy0MrhxRbk_bPOSvJf77Zid_34iHmvkro6NfWc/image.jpg?width=600</featured:image><media:content type="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODAyMjY5OS9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY4MTM5NzkxMH0.2OJNNiy0MrhxRbk_bPOSvJf77Zid_34iHmvkro6NfWc/image.jpg?width=600"/><tags><tag>young quebecers</tag><tag>quebec separatism</tag><tag>quebec independence</tag><tag>angus reid</tag><tag>quebec religion</tag><tag>quebec religious</tag><tag>canada religion</tag><tag>religion in canada</tag><tag>religion in quebec</tag><tag>patriotism in canada</tag><tag>patriotism in quebec</tag><tag>baby boomers</tag><tag>baby boomers canada</tag><tag>millennials</tag><tag>millennials canada</tag><tag>millennials quebec</tag><tag>cardus</tag></tags><category><category>Montreal</category><category>News</category><category>News</category><category>Top Stories Home</category><category>Top Stories Spots</category></category><city>Montreal</city><language>Montreal</language></item><item><guid>2655776682</guid><title>A Viral Video On The Montreal Metro Shows Someone Collapse On A Train — But It Was A Stunt</title><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 21:00:38 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>The video shows people rushing to help.</p>]]></description><dcterms:alternative><![CDATA[<p>The video shows people rushing to help.</p>]]></dcterms:alternative><link>https://www.mtlblog.com/montreal/a-viral-video-on-the-montreal-metro-shows-someone-collapse-on-a-train-but-it-was-a-stunt</link><dc:creator>Alanna Moore</dc:creator><photo:credit><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hezii68/" target="_blank">@hezii68 | Instagram</a> via <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWjjp4UgVcJ/" target="_blank">@vroom_vroom514 | Instagram</a></p>]]></photo:credit><dcterms:modified>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 21:48:42 +0000</dcterms:modified><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="092da" data-rm-shortcode-id="beab3d35c5e6a3f56b8d6a63532ec292" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" class="rm-shortcode " loading="lazy" src="https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28023681&width=980"    /> <p>A viral video shows someone collapsing on the <a href="https://www.mtlblog.com/montreal/justin-trudeau-was-spotted-thanking-supporters-at-a-montreal-metro-station-photo" target="_blank">Montreal metro</a> after getting caught between closing train doors at Lionel-Groulx station.

It doesn't matter if you identify as <a href="https://www.mtlblog.com/montreal/who-smokes-more-weed-montreal-francophones-or-anglophones-survey-answer" target="_blank">francophone or anglophone</a> — there is a clear love among many Quebecers for this style of joie de vivre. </p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.sqdc.ca/en-CA/about-the-sqdc/medias/2021/11/19/The-SQDC-reports-net-income-of-19-million-for-its-second-quarter" target="_blank">press release</a>, the SQDC earned a net income of $19 million in the quarter ending September 11 — a $3.9 million increase from the same quarter last year. The SQDC credits these results to its main goal: running illegal weed dealers out of business. It says it has invested time and energy in making sure Quebecers who indulge in cannabis get the best product available.</p><p>The SQDC had a grand total of $142 million in sales, up $21.8 million from the previous quarter, with $67.4 million set to be transferred to the provincial and federal governments.</p><p>The reported results suggest the SQDC has done pretty well in gaining customer trust: the agency has grown from 45 to 77 stores in Quebec over the past year and crossed the 1,000-employee threshold.</p><p>The quantities are significant this quarter, too: the organization sold nearly 25,000 kilograms of cannabis in its stores and almost 1,300 kilograms online, with an average sales price of $6.32 per gram, including tax.</p><p>Despite their impressive sales, the SQDC's focus remains on protecting cannabis users' health and converting consumers to the legal market, not encouraging cannabis use. The government corporation tries its best to accommodate Quebecers' interest in cannabis, seeking to give them the best product while helping them reduce health risks. </p><p>In other words, the SQDC's angle is that it's using its business for good — hoping that people will take its resources and information to heart.</p>]]></content:encoded><featured:image>https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODAwOTMwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY5NjI0NjUxMX0.1SCPX3jLQQRpCMC0pD2YL2nq0XD9p270pV8c3wJvptE/image.jpg?width=600</featured:image><media:content type="image"/><media:thumbnail url="https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODAwOTMwMy9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY5NjI0NjUxMX0.1SCPX3jLQQRpCMC0pD2YL2nq0XD9p270pV8c3wJvptE/image.jpg?width=600"/><tags><tag>sqdc montreal</tag><tag>weed in montreal</tag><tag>quebec weed market</tag><tag>sqdc</tag><tag>sqdc profits</tag><tag>cannabis</tag></tags><category><category>Copyedited</category><category>Editorial Sections</category><category>Top Stories Home</category><category>Top Stories Spots</category></category></item><item><guid>2655776897</guid><title>Looks Like Tourism To Quebec Has Had A Huge Spike But More People Keep Going To Ontario</title><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:40:13 +0000</pubDate><description><![CDATA[<p>Was it something we did?</p>]]></description><dcterms:alternative><![CDATA[<p>Was it something we did?</p>]]></dcterms:alternative><link>https://www.mtlblog.com/looks-like-tourism-to-quebec-has-had-a-huge-spike-but-more-people-keep-going-to-ontario</link><dc:creator>Teddy Elliot</dc:creator><photo:credit><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/cdtemple_info" target="_blank">Colin Temple | Dreamstime</a>, <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/adwo_info" target="_blank">Adwo | Dreamstime</a></p>]]></photo:credit><dcterms:modified>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 17:45:34 +0000</dcterms:modified><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img id="779e3" data-rm-shortcode-id="b31fd76b911a6d1238740f3f213e0b0f" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" class="rm-shortcode " loading="lazy" src="https://www.mtlblog.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=28021969&width=980"    /> <p>Despite what looks like a huge spike in <a href="https://www.mtlblog.com/montreal/canada-border-rules-change-for-vaccinated-americans" target="_blank">tourism to Quebec this August</a>, way more people entered Canada via Ontario during the summer months. Do tourists just not like us as much?

The highest number of tourists came in August, with 79,037 non-resident tourists entering through Quebec. </p><p>The spike in August tourism was also significant in Ontario, with 237,599 non-resident tourists entering via the province. It's wild to think that more tourists entered via Ontario in the month of August than they did via Quebec all summer, but this is where we're at. </p><p>In terms of travellers crossing the land border from the U.S. specifically, Quebec started out the summer with only 14,578 U.S. vehicles entering in May and gradually increased over the next couple of months.</p><p>U.S. tourism to Quebec had a huge spike in August — when Canada <a href="https://www.narcity.com/canada-us-border-restrictions-set-to-be-loosened-from-august-9" target="_blank">reopened its border</a> to fully vaccinated Americans — with 34,905 vehicles making their way up north via Quebec's border.</p><p>Ontario saw increasing numbers of U.S. vehicles throughout the summer, peaking at 178,601 in August.
