        <![CDATA[ <p>Julia Child was much more than just a bestselling cookbook author and chef. Over the course of her life, she was also a breast cancer survivor, a TV trailblazer, and a government spy. It's the famed chef's spy game that will be the focus of <em>Julia</em>, a new series being developed by ABC Signature and created by Benjamin Brand.</p><p>The project will draw its inspiration from Child's PBS program <em>Cooking for the C.I.A.</em> “I was disappointed when I learned that in this case, the C.I.A. stood for the Culinary Institute of America,” Brand <a href="http://deadline.com/2017/08/julia-dramedy-julia-child-cia-agent-benjamin-brand-abc-signature-1202148675/" target="_blank">told</a> Deadline. “<em>Cooking Secrets of the Central Intelligence Agency </em>always seemed like a more interesting show to me. Many years later, when I read a biography of Julia Child and learned about her experiences during World War II, working for the Office of Strategic Services—the precursor to the C.I.A.—the story of <em>Julia</em> quickly fell into place.”</p><p>Though <em>Julia </em>will be a work of fiction, here are 15 facts about the beloved cook, who was born on August 15, 1912.</p><h2>1. Julia Child met the inventor of the Caesar salad when she was a kid.</h2><p>As a preteen, Julia Child traveled to Tijuana on a family vacation. Her parents took her to dine at Caesar Cardini’s restaurant, so that they could all try his trendy “Caesar salad.” Child <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/07/dining/great-caesar-s-ghost-where-s-my-anchovy.html" target="_blank">recalled</a> the formative culinary experience <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/07/dining/great-caesar-s-ghost-where-s-my-anchovy.html">to</a> <em>The New York Times</em>: “My parents were so excited, eating this famous salad that was suddenly very chic. Caesar himself was a great big old fellow who stood right in front of us to make it. I remember the turning of the salad in the bowl was very dramatic. And egg in a salad was unheard of at that point.” Years later, when she was a famous chef in her own right, Child convinced Cardini’s daughter, Rosa, to share the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UknTx1qktLU">authentic recipe</a> with her.</p><h2>2. The WAVES and WACs rejected Julia Child for being too tall.</h2><p>Like so many others of her generation, Child felt the call to serve when America entered World War II. There was just one problem: her height. At a towering 6'2", Child was deemed “<a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7BUf0xhBN8EC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs88GCjKbOAhXi44MKHaAgCfwQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&q=too%20tall&f=false">too tall</a>” for both the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service (WAVES) and Women’s Army Corps (WAC). But she was accepted by the forerunner to the CIA, which brings us to our next point.</p><h2>3. Julia Child was a spy during World War II.</h2><p>Child took a position at the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was basically the CIA 1.0. She began as a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2007-featured-story-archive/julia-child.html">research assistant</a> in the Secret Intelligence division, where she worked directly for the head of the OSS, General William J. Donovan. But she moved over to the OSS Emergency Sea Rescue Equipment Section, and then took an overseas post for the final two years of the war. First in Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka) and later in Kunming, China, Child served as the chief of the OSS Registry. This meant she had top-level security clearance. It also meant she was working with Paul Child, the OSS officer she would eventually marry.</p><h2>4. Julia Child helped develop a shark repellent for the Navy.</h2><div class="media media-element-container media-width-constrained-728"> <div id="file-229309" class="file file-image file-image-jpeg"> <div class="content"> <figure><img class="media-element file-width-constrained-728 lazy cld-responsive" width="620" height="692" src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fit,f_auto,fl_lossy,q_auto,w_728/v1555911557/shape/mentalfloss/gettyimages-51166631.jpg?itok=XHU-D_QZ" alt="" title=""><figcaption><span class="field-name-field-credits">Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span></figcaption></figure></div> </div> </div><p>While Child was in the Emergency Sea Rescue Equipment Section, she helped the team in its search for a suitable shark repellent. Several U.S. naval officers had been attacked by the ocean predators since the war broke out, so the OSS brought in a scientist specializing in zoology and an anthropologist to come up with a fix. Child assisted in this mission, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2015-featured-story-archive/shark-repellent.html">recalled</a> her experience in the book <em>Sisterhood of Spies</em>: “I must say we had lots of fun. We designed rescue kits and other agent paraphernalia. I understand the shark repellent we developed is being used today for downed space equipment—strapped around it so the sharks won’t attack when it lands in the ocean.”</p><h2>5. Julia Child got married in bandages.</h2><p>Once the war ended, Julia and Paul Child <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7BUf0xhBN8EC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs88GCjKbOAhXi44MKHaAgCfwQ6AEIMDAD#v=onepage&q=car%20accident&f=false">decided</a> to take a “few months to get to know each other in civilian clothes.” They met with family members and traveled cross-country before they decided to tie the knot. The wedding took place on September 1, 1946. Julia remembered being “extremely happy, but a bit banged up from a car accident the day before.” She wasn’t kidding; she actually had to wear a bandage on the side of her face for her wedding photos. <em>The New York Review of Books</em> has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/08/18/cooking-storm/?pagination=false">one</a> of those pictures.</p><h2>6. Julia Child was a terrible cook well into her 30s.</h2><p>Child did not have a natural talent for cooking. In fact, she was a self-admitted disaster in the kitchen until she began taking classes at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, where she and Paul lived for several years. Prior to her marriage, Child simply fed herself frozen dinners. It was probably the safest choice; one of her earliest attempts at cooking <a target="_blank" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/julia-childs-recipe-for-a-thoroughly-modern-marriage-86160745/?no-ist">resulted in</a> an exploded duck and an oven fire.</p><h2>7. A lunch in Rouen changed Julia Child's life.</h2><p>Child repeatedly credited one meal with spurring her interest in fine foods: a lunch in the French city of Rouen that she and Paul enjoyed en route to their new home in Paris. The meal consisted of oysters <em>portugaises</em> on the half-shell, sole meunière browned in Normandy butter, a salad with baguettes, and cheese and coffee for dessert. They also “happily downed a whole bottle of Pouilly-Fumé” over <a target="_blank" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7BUf0xhBN8EC&printsec=frontcover&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs88GCjKbOAhXi44MKHaAgCfwQ6AEIMDAD#v=snippet&q=rouen%20oysters&f=false">the courses</a>.</p><h2>8. It took Julia Child nine years to write and publish her first cookbook.</h2><p><em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> revolutionized home cooking when it was published in 1961—but the revolution didn't happen overnight. Child first began work on her famous tome in 1952, when she met Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle. The French women were writing a cookbook aimed at teaching Americans how to make French cuisine, and brought Child on board as a third author. Nine years of research, rewrites, and rejections ensued before the book <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-julia-child-20040814-story.html">landed</a> a publisher at Alfred A. Knopf.</p><h2>9. Julia Child got famous by beating eggs on Boston public television.</h2><iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dw0Ij1Fxgq4" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p> Child’s big TV break came from an unlikely source: Boston’s local <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wgbh.org/watch/julia_child_bio.cfm">WGBH station</a>. While promoting <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>, Child appeared as a guest on the book review program <em>I’ve Been Reading</em>. But rather than sit down and discuss recipe semantics, Child started cracking eggs into a hot plate she brought with her. She made an omelette on air as she answered questions, and viewers loved it. The station <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-julia-child-20040814-story.html">received</a> dozens of letters begging for more demonstrations, which led WGBH producer Russell Morash to offer Child a deal. She filmed three pilot episodes, which turned into her star-making show <em>The French Chef</em>.</p><h2>10. All of Julia Child's essential utensils were kept in a "sacred bag."</h2><p>According to a 1974 <em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/12/23/good-cooking">New Yorker</a></em><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/12/23/good-cooking"> profile</a>, Child carried a large black canvas satchel known as the “sacred bag.” Rather than holy artifacts, it contained the cooking utensils she couldn’t live without. That included her pastry-cutting wheel, her favorite flour scoop, and her knives, among other things. She started using it when <em>The French Chef </em>premiered, and only entrusted certain people with its care.</p><h2>11. Julia Child survived breast cancer.</h2><p>Child’s doctors ordered a mastectomy in the late 1960s after a routine biopsy came back with cancerous results. She was in a depressed mood following her 10-day <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/julia-child-about-julia-child/555/">hospital stay</a>, and Paul was a wreck. But she later became vocal about her operation in hopes that it would remove the stigma for other women. She <a target="_blank" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/OnCallPlus/story?id=4016101&page=1">told</a> <em>TIME</em>, “I would certainly not pussyfoot around having a radical [mastectomy] because it’s not worth it.”</p><h2>12. Julia Child's marriage was well ahead of its time.</h2><p>As their meet-cute in the OSS offices would suggest, Paul and Julia Child had far from a conventional marriage (at least by 1950s standards). Once Julia’s career took off, Paul happily assisted in whatever way he could—as a taste tester, dishwasher, agent, or manager. He had retired from the Foreign Service in 1960, and immediately thrust himself into an active role in Julia’s business. <em>The New Yorker</em> took note of Paul’s progressive attitudes in its 1974 profile of Julia, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1974/12/23/good-cooking">noting</a> that he suffered “from no apparent insecurities of male ego.” He continued to serve as Julia’s partner in every sense of the word until his death in 1994.</p><h2>13. Julia Child was the first woman inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's Hall of Fame.</h2><p>Child spent her early years working for what would become the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1993, she joined another CIA: the Culinary Institute of America. The group inducted Child into its Hall of Fame that year, making her the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.juliachildfoundation.org/awards.html">first woman</a> to ever receive the honor.</p><h2>14. Julia Child earned the highest civilian honors from the U.S. and France.</h2><p>Along with that CIA distinction, Child received top civilian awards from both her home country and the country she considered her second home. In 2000, she accepted the Legion D’Honneur from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/20/us/legion-d-honneur-for-julia-child-for-popularizing-french-cuisine.html">Jacques Pépin</a> at Boston’s Le Méridien hotel. Just three years later, George W. Bush gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom.</p><h2>15. Julia Child's kitchen is in the Smithsonian.</h2><iframe width="620" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwiv30rV4LU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe><p> In 2001, Julia donated the kitchen that Paul designed in their Cambridge, Massachusetts home to the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History. Although it’s not possible to walk directly through it, there are <a target="_blank" href="http://amhistory.si.edu/juliachild/jck/html/textonly/visiting.asp">three viewports</a> from which visitors can see the high counters, wall of copper pots, and gleaming stove. Framed recipes, articles, and other mementos from her career adorn the surrounding walls—and, of course, there’s a television which plays her cooking shows on loop.</p> ]]>
