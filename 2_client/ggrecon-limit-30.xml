        <![CDATA[ <p>Cuyler "<strong>Huke</strong>" Garland, or Huke the Nuke, is a reigning World Champion in the <a href="/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> League, having swept aside the competition in the <em>Modern Warfare</em> era with Dallas Empire. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>The multi-fps world champ was recently stunned by the Empire who brought in Tyler "<strong>FeLo</strong>" Johnson to replace Huke, who subsequently moved to the bench, and then onto LA Thieves' roster. Having played just a handful of matches with the Thieves, Huke found himself out of sorts again, making his way to the bench again, with Thomas "<strong>TJHaly</strong>" being reinstated.</p> <p>Having promised the fans a video to clear up any confusion, Huke has now released a 30-minute long self-interview, in which he opened up about the roster changes and taking a performance-enhancing drug named Adderall in previous seasons.</p> <h2>Huke Opens Up About Adderall Use</h2> <p>The reigning world champion started his video by discussing the Dallas Empire and their formation in <em>Modern Warfare</em>, before moving on to the World Championship win. </p> <p>Remorsefully, Huke continued to admit that his gold medal didn't give him joy, as he was using Adderall at the time. He said, "I won Champs and I didn't really feel good, and it was mainly because of one thing: I, at the time, was taking Adderall."</p> <p>"I first started taking Adderall when I was 18 and I was on and off for a bit.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/wre9yVQY0uk" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wre9yVQY0uk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p>Huke continued to say "This is very uncomfortable for me to talk about, but it wasn't doing anything good for me. I realised it that night because I won the event on Adderall and the feeling afterwards was, like, not that great of a feeling.</p> <p>"I was comparing it to when I first won when I was 16-years-old when I was completely sober, and it was a feeling that you can't even put into words. It was so much joy and I was really proud of myself.</p> <p>"I compared that, and I was like hmm, if I felt that good when I was sixteen why can't I now when I'm 20 and just won champs? It didn't feel the same."</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>The LA Thieves player also used the video to discuss how the rumours surrounding his Adderall use led to his benching, despite being off the drug since Stage 1 of the CDL 2021 season. </p> <p>He admitted that rumours about his drug-taking earned him a "stigma" in the community and was a factor behind moving to the Thieves bench. </p> <p>Within the video, he also opened up about the move away from the Dallas Empire, and the lack of support from his team in trying to rectify their results despite being clean. He admitted that he learned about the benching via his brother, rather than a member of the Empire.</p> <h2>Players Back Huke For Speaking Out</h2> <p>With the overarching Adderall issue in <em>Call of Duty</em>, many players have taken to Twitter to support Huke for speaking out and call for the league to implement methods that can assist in players' health.</p> <p>The ever-vocal and fitness fanatic Doug "<strong>Censor</strong>" Martin was the first to congratulate Huke on his honesty. </p> <p> </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Censor/status/1402668955064573956?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">I’m glad <a href="https://twitter.com/Huke?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Huke</a> is being transparent about adderall and how it made him feel while competing. <br /><br />I hope we can have a system to drug test players - not so much to “make an even playing field”, because I don’t care if my comp takes it, more so for their long term health. <a href="https://t.co/0mSNDmEOu7">https://t.co/0mSNDmEOu7</a></p> — Censor (@Censor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Censor/status/1402668955064573956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Former World Champion Justin "<strong>Silly</strong>" Fargo-Palmer also backed Huke, especially on his comments surrounding the departure from Dallas Empire and his former teammates.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/silly702/status/1402673499664130054?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Takes a lot to make a video like this.

        <![CDATA[ <p>Activision Blizzard's long haul towards <em>Overwatch 2</em> seems to be heading into its final stretch, as the relay baton was <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/overwatch-jeff-kaplan/" target="_blank" title="Overwatch Community Divided Following Jeff Kaplan Departure News">passed from Jeff Kaplan to Aaron Keller</a>.</p> <p>With developers bursting into a sprint to get the product over the line, it appears that they look set to make a long jump by adding environmental changes to their <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/maps-for-unannounced-overwatch-2-game-mode-revealed/" target="_blank" title="Maps For Unannounced Overwatch 2 Game Mode Revealed ">brand-new unannounced maps</a>.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>It's undeniable that the new instalment of the <a href="/overwatch/" title="Overwatch"><em>Overwatch</em></a> franchise will mix the game up like never before. The decision to switch to a <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/overwatch-fans-furious-over-5v5-change-by-blizzard/" target="_blank" title="Overwatch Fans Furious Over 5v5 Change By Blizzard">5v5 PvP model</a> comes as the most significant difference, although Blizzard seems to be holding on to a full stack of aces in the sleeves.</p> <p>Their latest announcement will also change the game significantly, revealing that <em>Overwatch 2</em> will have environment changing maps.</p> <h2>Overwatch Developers Confirm Environment Changing Maps</h2> <p>Taking to a blog post, <em>Overwatch</em> Lighting Artist Fabien Christin said: "Overwatch is set in a bright and colourful world, and much of the character of the game is expressed through its maps. The most important thing at this stage is to design a map that’s fun to play!"</p> <p>"For <em>Overwatch 2</em>, we wanted to create interesting new moods that would entirely change the feeling of a location. Imagine travelling to Numbani and seeing the futuristic city illuminated in a warm African sunset, or landing in a rainy Paris, with all the shops glowing with warm golden lights that invite you inside to eat a croissant until the rain stops."</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>The example given is the fast-paced deathmatch map of Necropolis. As a night-time environment in the current title, the developers are now looking to add more decorative scenes to the map, by painting it into a bright and sandy desert-esque pallette. </p> <p><img src="/media/zacfl4ek/ow-map-env.png?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <h2>Game-changing Environmental Changes in Overwatch 2</h2> <p>The developers aren't simply pasting new colours onto the map either. The environmental changes will see experiments with the weather be added, changing the visibility in-game and creating a harsher atmosphere depending on which play style you've chosen. </p> <p><img src="/media/n11oetxf/ow-map-sandy.png?width=500&amp;height=281.3205417607224" alt="" width="500" height="281.3205417607224"></p> <p>Blizzard was keen to add that sandstorms, fog, snow, and rain were all possible to be added into the <em>Overwatch 2</em> maps, alongside the usual clear day/night settings that we're used to.</p> <p>It's not yet clear as to whether we shall see a base map selected that will be portrayed in the esports scene, or whether all varients will be possible and therefore considered on a map-to-map basis.</p> <p>Either way, it's great to see such detail being added to the highly-anticipated <em>Overwatch 2</em> title.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Image via Activision Blizzard</em></p> ]]>

For the more hours viewed, the rewards will stack up, with a total of four hours needed to get your hands on the final drop. </p> <p>Viewers will be happy to know that a rare (and exclusive) Bangalore Ocean Spear skin is up for grabs, alongside an Epic “You are the Champion” Weapon Charm. The other two rewards come in the form of a rare Copperhead Alternator skin and an ALGS-inspired Holo-Spray.</p> <h3>Rare ALGS Bangalore Skin</h3> <p><img src="/media/i0jdanby/algs-reward-skin.jpg?width=500&amp;height=260.8122362869198" alt="" width="500" height="260.8122362869198"></p> <h3>Epic ALGS Weapon Charm</h3> <p><img src="/media/aishhfih/algs-reward-charm.jpg?width=500&amp;height=238.6609071274298" alt="" width="500" height="238.6609071274298"></p> <h2>ALGS Grand Finals Preview</h2> <p>Going into the ALGS NA Grand Finals, NRG look to be on course to take home the championship, having secured a 1st place seed and a ten-point advantage. The recent addition of Chris "<strong>sweetdreams</strong>" Sexton to their roster in January has pushed NRG to the top of the tree. </p> <p>Other NA giants such as TSM FTX, G2 Esports, and Team Liquid all find themselves with points advantages over the bottom ten sides starting on zero.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>The most unlikely of teams in My Little Phony also find themselves with an eight-point advantage in the third seed, the highest of any org-less side. If any upset was on the cards, it would be to the hands of MLP.</p> <p>As for EMEA, NEW Esports are in the same boat as NRG by paddling out in front during the group stage, whilst they face fierce competition from second-placed Alliance.</p> <p>Taking place on June 12 and 13, players will earn their rewards by tuning into the Twitch stream, and link their platform account to their EA profile.  </p> <p> </p> <p><em>Image via Respawn Entertainment </em></p> ]]>

Here’s everything we know about the game so far…</p> <h2>Battlefield 2042’s Release Trailer</h2> <p>The trailer for the game has launched as part of a massive livestream event, in which the game is officially dubbed <em>Battlefield 2042</em>. You can check it out here:</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASzOzrB-a9E" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ASzOzrB-a9E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <h2>Battlefield 2042’s Story</h2> <p><img src="/media/e0wjenab/battlefield-basejump.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Battlefield 2042 Everything We Know" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <p>The story of Battlefield 2042 takes place in the near(ish) future on an earth wrought by resource wars created by climate change, as crops fail and drinkable water becomes sparse. The game will allow you to play as Russia and an MEC funded guerrilla group formed by refugees, and will contain what is supposedly a “No Russian”-grade controversial sequence that’s sure to rustle a lot of feathers.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Battlefield 2042’s Specialists</h2> <p>Four playable specialists have been leaked for the game so far. In an early leak from Henderson, it was suggested that the game’s story would feature hired “specialists” that operate on behalf of global superpowers, so these characters are thought to be those freelance specialists with their own individual abilities and tactics. We have our first look at the game’s specialists courtesy of BattlefieldPlug on Twitter; they seem to go by the names Maria Falck, Pyotr Boris Guskovsky, Wikus Casper Van Daele and Webster Macay.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldPlug/status/1402611176488378370" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">🚨Specialists in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BATTLEFIELD2042?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BATTLEFIELD2042</a> 🚨<br><br>- Maria_Falck<br>- Pyotr_Boris_Guskovsky<br>- Wikus_Casper_Van_Daele<br>- Webster_Macay <a href="https://t.co/Z4We6HalpI">pic.twitter.com/Z4We6HalpI</a></p> — Battlefield 6 News &amp; Updates (@BattlefieldPlug) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldPlug/status/1402611176488378370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <h2>Battlefield 2042’s Battle Pass System</h2> <p><img src="/media/30kngmk0/battlefield-wingsuit.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Battlefield 2042 Everything We Know" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <p>As revealed before the launch broadcast by Tom Henderson, the game is set to boast a battle pass system akin to that of modern <em>Call of Duty</em>. He expands on this in a tweet explaining some rewards that the pass will offer:</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1402595883406049285?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">"4 New Specialists (1 per Season of the Year 1 Pass), 4 Battle Passes (1 per Season of the Year 1 Pass), 3 Epic Skin Bundles (”Blistered Earth”, ”Tempest”, and ”Cold Blood”)"<br><br>Battle Pass confirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BATTLEFIELD2042?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BATTLEFIELD2042</a></p> — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1402595883406049285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Battlefield 2042’s Ultimate Edition</h2> <p>The game, as it standard for many games nowadays, will of course have its own upgraded special edition. The ‘Ultimate Edition’ for <em>Battlefield 2042 </em>will include:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Early access to the game via the open beta, and access to the ultimate version of the game on October 22</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">The Baku ACB-90 melee takedown knife, Mr Chompy Epic Weapon Charm, Landfall Player Card Background and Old Guard Tag</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">4 new specialists (one for every season of the 1 year pass), 4 battle passes, 3 epic skin bundles (Blistered Earth, Tempest, and Cold Blood)</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Shadow Stalker Legendary Outfit, Obsidian Legendary Weapon Skin, Onyx Legendary Vehicle Skin</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Official digital artbook and exclusive digital soundtrack</li> </ul> <p><img src="/media/bj5hwcz1/battlefield-tank.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Battlefield 2042 Everything We Know" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <h2>Battlefield 2042's Release date</h2> <p>The release of Battlefield 2042 is set to occur on October 22, with a full gameplay reveal coming on June 13, so we won't have to wait long to get a good look at how the game will play either.</p> <p>That’s all we know about the latest Battlefield title so far. The game looks like a stellar entry into the shooter series and a great game that’ll define the next-gen era. We can’t wait to get our hands on it and jump straight into the fight.</p> <p><em>Images via DICE</em></p> ]]>

      <description>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds' (PUBG) newest update has introduced what the community has dubbed “Terminator Bots”</description>

        <![CDATA[ <p><a href="/pubg/"><em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds' (PUBG)</em></a> newest update has introduced what the community has dubbed “Terminator Bots”. Described by the developers as “upgraded bots”, it seems that these bots are a little too advanced. The <em>PUBG</em> subreddit is flooded with clips of these bots absolutely destroying human players with their impossible tracking and aiming skills.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>Surely these advanced bots can’t be as bad as they sound, right? Let’s take an inside look at <em>PUBG’s</em> new Terminator Bots.</p> <p><img src="/media/oysl5u1t/pubg-terminator-bot-movie.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.1969439728353" alt="pubg-terminator-bots" width="500" height="281.1969439728353"></p> <h2>What Are Terminator Bots?</h2> <p>Terminator Bots is the community-dubbed name for the newly upgraded bots added to <em>PUBG</em> in <a href="/articles/pubg-12-1-update-introduces-new-weapon-vehicle-and-more">Update 12.1</a>. Previously, <em>PUBG</em> bots were rather weak and dumb. The old bots posed no real challenge to players and were nothing but bullet fodder to practise your aim on.</p> <p>Update 12.1 hoped to change this, giving bots more realistic movements and actions. But what came next was much more than that. These formerly worthless bots turned into murder machines.</p> <p>Described by the developers as “upgraded bots”, these new AI were at a level far past that. Now, running into a Terminator Bot feels no different than encountering a wall hacker or aimbotter. These bots track players through walls and laser them down with pinpoint accuracy.</p> <p>To make matters worse, these new bots love to thirst. Terminator Bots target downed players and finish them instantly. These bots give players no opportunity to revive their teammate and get back into the fight. This is extremely frustrating considering how much of an investment a single game of <em>PUBG</em> can be. No one wants to loot for ten minutes just to get thirsted by a bot.</p> <p>We can paint a general picture with words, but you’ll need to see footage of these Terminator Bots in action to truly understand the ridiculous power they possess.</p> <h2>Terminator Bots In Action</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/ntmh9q/bot_with_aimwallhacks_hipfire_deletes_2_players/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artPost artReddit"> <blockquote class="reddit-card"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/ntmh9q/bot_with_aimwallhacks_hipfire_deletes_2_players/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Bot with aim/wallhacks hipfire deletes 2 players before they can even shoot back - Bluehole definitely making the game fun for its dwindling playerbase...</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/">PUBATTLEGROUNDS</a></blockquote> </div> </div> <p>This clip is a conglomeration of a Terminator Bot’s worst features. The clip begins with the bot blatantly tracking players through walls and terrain. Once it encounters some players, the Terminator Bot instantly hip-fires them down in mere milliseconds. The two real players had no chance against this advanced AI. Both human players were dead before they knew what hit them.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/ntjoxz/thought_we_died_to_a_cheater_turns_out_it_was/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artPost artReddit"> <blockquote class="reddit-card"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/ntjoxz/thought_we_died_to_a_cheater_turns_out_it_was/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">Thought we died to a cheater, turns out it was just a terminator bot.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/">PUBATTLEGROUNDS</a></blockquote> </div> </div> <p>This clip happens so fast you have to watch it back a couple of times to realise what occurred. A Terminator Bot snaps between targets and one-shot kills its victim with a flick quicker than any human player could ever hope to pull off.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/nrtzyo/bots_with_wallhack_and_autoaim_on_100_really/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artPost artReddit"> <blockquote class="reddit-card"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/nrtzyo/bots_with_wallhack_and_autoaim_on_100_really/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">BOTs with WallHack and AutoAim on 100% , really PUBGS ? you want us go away ?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/">PUBATTLEGROUNDS</a></blockquote> </div> </div> <p>Are you spectating a hacker or a Terminator Bot? It’s hard to tell the difference. These bots move in ways strikingly similar to how a hacker would—flicking their aim around, instantly locking in on targets, tracking targets through walls and terrain, etc. Dying in this way to a human player would warrant a report. Unfortunately, this is standard gameplay for a Terminator Bot.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Community Reaction To Terminator Bots</h2> <p>As one may expect, the <em>PUBG</em> community is not happy with these new Terminator Bots.</p> <p>The addition of bots, in general, is <a href="/articles/pubg-is-infected-with-bots/">already a polarising topic</a>. However, players were finally getting used to them and had begun to accept the standard bots. But no one is okay with these new Terminator Bots.</p> <p><em>PUBG</em> die-hards have taken to the<em> PUBG</em> subreddit to voice their frustrations. One player claims that they have played nonstop since launch and sunk thousands of hours into the game. With the addition of Terminator Bots, this player claims to be putting<em> PUBG</em> down for the first time in years. “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/ns74cu/the_bot_update_i_am_putting_down_the_game_for_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-anchor="?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">The new AI has created terminator bots, and it is effectively like playing with a lobby of hackers.</a>”</p> <p>Speaking of hackers, <em>PUBG</em> was <a href="/guides/pubg-shield-anti-cheat/">finally making headway in that department</a>. Cheaters were getting banned at a high rate, and their numbers were beginning to dwindle. The developers had at long last found a solution to a problem that has plagued<em> PUBG</em> since its inception.</p> <p>Terminator Bots have destroyed all of this progress. There’s tons of testimony online from disgruntled players arguing that there’s no difference between a Terminator Bot and a cheater. Both have wallhacks and aimbot, and both are dreadful to play against. The cheater problem was finally starting to subside, and then <em>PUBG</em> developers go and essentially add their own version of AI cheaters into the game.</p> <p><img src="/media/wkrd00ir/pubg-action.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="pubg-terminator-bots" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Solution To Terminator Bots</h2> <p>The obvious solution to Terminator Bots is to revert them to their previous state. Players would much rather face off against mindless AI than the overpowered machines that are Terminator Bots.</p> <p>There’s also the option to remove bots entirely. One <em>PUBG</em> fanatic boasting 4,000+ hours played exclaims, “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/nrtzyo/bots_with_wallhack_and_autoaim_on_100_really/h0iml7k?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-anchor="?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">REMOVE THE BOTS, all of them, lame ones and Terminators.</a>” People play online competitive multiplayer games to face off against real human opponents, not bots. Save the AI for single-player games. Matchmaking times may be a bit longer, but the removal of bots would lead to a better gameplay experience overall.</p> <p>At this point, it's unlikely that the developers will completely remove bots. Our best hope is that these Terminator bots receive a swift nerf or are reverted to their previous state. Otherwise, the playerbase will be forced to bow down to our new cyborg overlords.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via PUBG Corporation | Orion Pictures</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>A familiar face from way back in the early <em><a rel="noopener" href="/call-of-duty" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a> </em>days could be about to rear his head. While we wait patiently for the imminent drop of <a rel="noopener" href="/guides/warzone-season-4-release-date-leaks-maps-weapons-zombies/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> Season 4</a>, Activision has kicked its marketing machine into overdrive. Now, the latest trailer has teased the potential return of <em>Black Ops 2</em>'s villainous Raul Menendez. </p> <p>Although <em>Warzone</em> is a battle royale game at its core, that doesn't mean there isn't a story that ties it to a larger <em>Call of Duty</em> universe. With <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em> taking us back to the '80s with the story of Russell Adler and his hunt for Perseus, <em>Warzone</em> soon followed suit, blew up the original Verdansk, and replaced it with Verdansk '84 for Season 3. </p> <p>Vikhor "Stich" Kuzmin is the main focus of Season 4, and with the one-eyed antagonist putting his final plans for "Greater Russia" into place, it looks like he could soon be joined by another big bad of the franchise.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <h2>Who is Raul Menendez coming to Warzone Season 4?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1402291783611076608?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Wraith mentions “Our man in South Africa is standing by” in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> Season 3’s outro. <br /><br />Well, it just so happens Raul Menendez was working in Africa in the 80’s 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/osjXgPbtWz">pic.twitter.com/osjXgPbtWz</a></p> — ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1402291783611076608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Speculation that a Menendez will drop into Verdansk first started circulating when the Season 4 trailer teased what's to come. A seemingly throwaway like saw Wraith mention "our man in South Africa", which has led to the idea of Menendez appearing as an Operator. </p> <p>For context, Menendez was the main antagonist of 2012's <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em>. The game split its time between the late '80s and the year 2025, meaning we got to see two different sides of Menendez. It just so happens the Nicaraguan drug lord was operating out of Angola in 1986. It was here that Alex Mason shot Menendez in the eye and left him permanently scarred.</p> <p><em>Warzone</em>'s current setting on 1984 means any appearance of Menendez would feature him pre-Mason and with both eyes, but with Angola being located near South Africa, fans could be onto something with this one. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Is Raul Menendez coming to Warzone Season 4?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1402294373266583552?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">"All the pieces are in play. Make the call."<br /><br />Following Adler's extraction by Woods and his team, Stitch’s master plan for the Verdansk test subjects faces a new challenge. <a href="https://t.co/VEwz2R5qjL">pic.twitter.com/VEwz2R5qjL</a></p> — Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1402294373266583552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>It might not be as simple as tossing Raul Menendez into <em>Warzone</em> Season 4. Although the setting and timelines seem to marry up with him being the mystery man in South Africa, critics think it's someone else entirely. One disinterested player wrote, "I hope not, we need fresh faces, apartheid-era South African villain would be cool, not another rehash, plus he was in Angola at the time I believe, which is far from South Africa".</p> <p>Others were critical of adding Menendez to the game - saying it makes the already complicated lore even more confusing. Someone else simply added, "That moment where you sit there for like 5 minutes trying to remember which game Menendez is from cause there's so many storylines and keeping track of characters starts getting difficult... Yup... that was me..."</p> <p>Still, Menendez has his supporters. Backing up the idea of a Menendez Operator, one gamer wrote, "I mean it's possible, remember when we first saw him in bo2 he was at a radio station maybe he was talking to Stich". Another added, "In certain loading screens for some maps you can see some paper with the name Menendez in it". There's just one week until we get to see what Raven Software has up its sleeve with <em>Warzone</em> Season 4, and as we look for more hints of Menendez, the plot continues to thicken.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Activision</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Over the years, many people on the internet have wondered what constitutes an esport. Sure, there are games that everyone thinks of when it comes to esports, like<em> Dota 2 </em>and <em>CounterStrike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)</em>. Nowadays, however, the definition has changed tremendously. No longer is esports purely associated with first-person shooters or MOBAs; instead, it represents a variety of genres and styles.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <h2>What is Esports?</h2> <p>The question of what makes an esport has puzzled the gaming community for decades. With games like <em>Farming Simulator 2019</em> drawing massive tournament crowds, the definition of esports has changed a lot over the years. TSM's legendary signing of renowned chess Grandmaster Hikaru <strong>"GMHikaru"</strong> Nakamura brought chess to the forefront of the esports world. Nakamura's huge online presence and penchant for online battles showed the world that chess is an esport.</p> <p> </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/TorontoWill/status/1400904092126531587" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Here goes Microsoft again, trying to recapture the smash hit esport success of Farming Simulator.</p> — Toronto Will (@TorontoWill) <a href="https://twitter.com/TorontoWill/status/1400904092126531587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p> </p> <h3>Microsoft Provides an Answer</h3> <p>Now, Microsoft has challenged peoples' idea of what makes an esport once more. The software company announced on Twitter that it would be hosting an esports competition. There's only one twist, however; the entire competition would take place in Microsoft Excel.</p> <p> </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/msexcel/status/1400829702667915277" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Financial modeling as an e-sport. Watch eight top financial modelers around the world work their mad <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Excel?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Excel</a> skills on June 8 at 12 PM UTC. Find out more (and check out the merch): <a href="https://t.co/GqkmWjSFOo">https://t.co/GqkmWjSFOo</a></p> — Microsoft Excel (@msexcel) <a href="https://twitter.com/msexcel/status/1400829702667915277?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p> </p> <p>Microsoft brought together eight of the world's best financial modellers on June 8 in the Financial Modelling World Cup's 888 Battle. The Financial Modelling World Cup stated that this event would showcase eight players from eight different countries battling it out on June 8, and they most certainly delivered. The event featured modellers with the highest skill levels in the world, all competing in one standalone event.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h3>The 888 Battle Rages On</h3> <p>In this competition, John Lim (Australia), Michael Jarman (Canada), Andrew Ngai (United Kingdom), Anup Agarwal (India), Gabriela Stroj (Poland), Jason Webber (South Africa), Jeff Heng Siang Tan (Malaysia), and Stephanie Annerose (United States) showed off their financial modelling prowess throughout the one-hour duration of the competition.</p> <p>The event drew a small crowd of 78,000 Excel fans, but it drew plenty of interest online and on social media, as well. Many people tuned in just to witness the rise of another unconventional esport.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kMaLZna07s" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3kMaLZna07s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p>In the end, Michael Jarman took home the first prize, scoring 700 points total. John Lim was a close second, scoring 675 points. All the modellers brought their unique approach to Excel with them during the battle, which gave each a unique advantage over the other players. Fans were excited to see these young professionals battle it out, which got them hyped for more Financial Modelling World Cup Events.</p> <h2>What Does Excel Mean for Esports?</h2> <p>Excel users and financial modellers alike have been curious about when the software program would garner an esports following. The Financial Modelling World Cup brought Excel to the world's attention, as it partnered with Microsoft and some of the best financial modellers in the world to bring Excel to the forefront of esports.</p> <p>Before the 888 Battle, the Financial Modelling World Cup had hosted other competitions over the years. While their YouTube channel only dates back to December 9, 2020, they have been hosting Excel competitions for a while now. Their website boasts that these competitions are educational for both the viewers and the modellers themselves.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Brinkmanship/status/1400921920174915586" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Oh, it's real.

This competition is part of the ongoing Financial Modelling World Cup, which will wrap up by November 30, 2021.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>The Internet Reacts to the Battle</h2> <p>With all of the financial modelling events coming into fruition, many are wondering if the software program qualifies as an esport. It most certainly does, as it has drawn a significant online following. People from around the world have gathered to witness one of the world's most unique competitions, which was certainly exciting for both fans and participants.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Falloutt/status/1401228588557426692" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">I got my money on Anup Agarwal<a href="https://twitter.com/TSM?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TSM</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/followdunc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@followdunc</a> sign this man <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TSMFTXWIN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TSMFTXWIN</a> <a href="https://t.co/gdOzECUPu5">pic.twitter.com/gdOzECUPu5</a></p> — Jon Kefaloukos 🇬🇷 (@Falloutt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Falloutt/status/1401228588557426692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Now that the Financial Modelling World Cup has made its professional events open to the general public, upcoming competitions might gain more traction on the internet. Microsoft's viral tweet about the event certainly helped attendance grow on Tuesday, which brought the Financial Modelling World Cup to the forefront of the esports world.</p> <p>While what can be classified as an esport is still up for debate to most gamers, it is safe to say that it can encompass almost anything. It seems that any online event that brings a crowd together over a mutual competition seems to meet the current definition of an esport. Whether players are gathered over chess or Excel, they are still playing an esport. The definition is fluid and still changing, so who knows what the weird esports 2022 and beyond will bring.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1401241186531172359" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">You can COUNT us in.</p> — Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1401241186531172359?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>All we know is that the internet can't get enough of Excel being an esport. The event spawned plenty of memes and confused reactions from the gaming public. Despite the confusion, the competition gained a lot of positive reception online, which helped the Financial Modelling World Cup for future events. Now the competition has fans and a following, which has given it plenty of internet fame.</p> <p>With the next set of challenges just around the corner, the internet is more excited than ever for the upcoming Financial Modelling World Cup. The esports world got a small taste of what Excel can bring to the table, which will be revealed when the next World Cup event kicks off on June 25.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Microsoft | Financial Modelling World Cup</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>A new dawn is approaching and we can feel the chill of another <a rel="noopener" href="/call-of-duty" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> crossover, as the world of <em>Warzone</em> and <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> prepare to continue colliding in a big way. With Season 3 coming to an end and <a rel="noopener" href="/guides/warzone-season-4-release-date-leaks-maps-weapons-zombies/" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty: Warzone </em></a><a rel="noopener" href="/guides/warzone-season-4-release-date-leaks-maps-weapons-zombies/" target="_blank">Season 4 </a>waiting in the wings, all eyes are on what's next.</p> <p>While Season 3 has garnered another warm reception thanks to the introduction of Verdansk '84 and the recent Action Heroes bundle with <em>Die Hard</em> and <em>Rambo</em>, not everyone has been a big fan. As one of the best in the business, Nick "<a rel="noopener" href="/streamers/nickmercs/" target="_blank"><strong>NICKMERCS</strong></a>" Kolcheff has passed judgement on what Raven Software delivered, and has given a few handy hints on what changes <em>Warzone</em> needs moving forward.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <h2>What Warzone changes does NICKMERCS want to see?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/ppsbLODbBBQ?t=33" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ppsbLODbBBQ?start=33&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p>Although the usual Reloaded added new POIs like Nakatomi Plaza and CIA Outpost, it clearly wasn't enough for Kolcheff. Offering his advice on how <em>Warzone</em> can keep things fresh, NICKMERCS told viewers on YouTube, "The biggest issue with the brand new map is if they put something out and they swing and miss, that’s bad, that’s horrible...We’ve seen other games do this, it could ruin the game completely.”</p> <p>There's no denying that <em>Warzone</em> has been a little tame with its changes, and despite Verdasnk '84 taking us to a whole new decade, there wasn't a massive overhaul of POIs. Returning to how Raven needs to adapt to survive, NICKMERCS added, "In my opinion, I really like the addition of the Die Hard plaza. I thought it was great, I loved the Specialist and the vault. If they keep doing things like that, I’m in".</p> <p>Discussing the wait between revamps, NICKMERCS concluded, “If [map changes] are few and far between and we have to wait weeks, and weeks, and months on end — for one building and a vault, I’m not on board for all that. I’m already programmed, I’m impatient". For many, Nakatomi Plaza is all well and good, but they're constantly wanting to know what comes next.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Is NICKMERCS right about the Warzone changes?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/CoDNewsRecon/status/1402559680615010305?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">One day to go until the Season 4 announcement - what are we hoping for? 👇 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOpsColdWar?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOpsColdWar</a> <a href="https://t.co/whVyUBWmSN">pic.twitter.com/whVyUBWmSN</a></p> — Call of Duty News (@CoDNewsRecon) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoDNewsRecon/status/1402559680615010305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>It's easy to see where Kolcheff has come from. While the like of <em>Apex Legends</em> survive on introducing new Legends instead of massively revamping the map, <em>Warzone</em> is stuck with <em>Fortnite</em> as a game that relies on selling skins rather than making characters integral to the story. Speaking of <em>Fortnite</em>, Epic Games continues to reinvent and refresh with each season. Only recently, <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-2-season-7/" target="_blank">Chapter 2 Season 7</a> gave <em>Fortnite</em> a sci-fi makeover and added new mechanics like pilotable UFOs alongside a brand new Battle Pass mechanic. </p> <p>Although we're expecting a new Reloaded in the Season 4 midpoint, it remains to be seen what exactly that will involve. Sadly, we're probably destined for another tune-up rather than a completely different Verdansk. For the time being though, it looks like we're sticking with Verdansk '84 and the <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> theme. We'd like to think NICMERCS' hopes of more frequent POI updates will be listened to, but to be honest, Raven has enough problems trying to fix the plethora of glitches, let alone adding new POIs every couple of weeks.  </p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Activision | FaZe Clan</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>The Xbox Game Pass has done wonders for Xbox users, filling their download queue with enough games to keep them busy until the end of time for a lump sum every month. It’s helped them to get a slight drop on PlayStation, especially with their Series S console offering a budget introduction to the latest generation of consoles and catering to the audience who just want to pick up and play a game for a bit, rather than dissolve into intense narrative-led titles.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>And now it looks like they’re going harder on the entertainment side of things, as a new Game Pass Ultimate perk has reared its head to keep users busy.</p> <h2>Xbox Game Pass Offers Free Month Of Disney+</h2> <p><img src="/media/twsbrlly/game-pass.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Xbox Game Pass Offers 30 Days Of Free Disney Plus" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <p>To celebrate the latest time-twisting dip into the MCU in <em>Loki</em>, Xbox Game Pass are offering a month of Disney’s streaming service Disney+ for free. This isn’t the first time Game Pass has collaborated with Game Pass, mind - a similar offer was given out during the holiday period for 30 days of Disney+, and now the offer’s come around again for those who missed out the first time around. They teased that something to do with <em>Loki </em>was coming soon in a cryptic(ish) tweet a few days before this deal has come to light.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/XboxGamePass/status/1401992357357178887?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">At first we were going to make this big flashy video to tease the next Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Perk but in the end we decided to go with something a little more...

You’ll be able to find the offer on the perks gallery on the Xbox gallery. Once you’ve given it a click, it’ll redirect you to the Disney+ website where you can claim the offer until September 30.</p> <p>The offer is proof that the Xbox Game Pass is one of the best things for a next-gen gamer to have in their arsenal, and with their new stretch into the entertainment space with their Disney+ collab, it looks like it’ll soon be an essential asset for those who own an Xbox console.</p> <p><em>Images via Marvel Entertainment | Disney | Xbox</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Gone are the primal weapons, as <a href="/fortnite/" title="Fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a> has officially been taken over by aliens for Season 7, which has been aptly named 'Invasion'. </p> <p>With a new, innovated battle pass style, players will be racing to rack up the numbers of their battle stars in order to get their hands on each 'page' of unlockable prizes, but to do so, they'll need to complete challenges.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>One of the week one challenges is to 'place rubber ducks in Retail Row, Believer Beach, and Pleasant Park'. So, where exactly are these ducks, and how quickly can you get down to them in order to snag the XP you need?</p> <h2>Fortnite Season 7 Week 1 - Pleasant Park Rubber Duck Locations</h2> <p>In Pleasant Park, there are two locations for the rubber ducks. For the first one, you'll want to head right into the middle of the map under the veranda by the football pitch. Underneath there, you'll find a bench near a hedge and a lovely yellowy-orange glow that represents the duck. </p> <p>For the second location, you need to make sure you land fairly near the gas station.  It's placed right next to one of the pumps, so no need to go inside - just head by the left-hand side of a pump, and you're good to go!</p> <p><img src="/media/witb5vht/pleasant.png?width=418&amp;height=271?width=418&amp;height=271" alt="Fortnite Duck Locations" width="418" height="271" /></p> <h2>Fortnite Season 7 Week 1 - Retail Row Rubber Duck Location</h2> <p>There's just the one duck in Retail Row, and you'll find it sat patiently waiting on the basketball court in the southeast corner of the map. Look for the yellow glow again, and you'll spot the duck!</p> <p><img src="https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2021/06/eb196-16231594671908-800.jpg?width=606&amp;height=213&amp;mode=max?width=500&amp;height=175.74257425742573" alt="Fortnite Duck Locations" width="500" height="175.74257425742573" /></p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>Fortnite Season 7 Week 1 - Believer Beach Rubber Duck Location</h2> <p>Believer Beach is a bit of an alien hotspot at the moment, so be careful when landing in the fateful area - but if you want to get quick access to your final rubber duck, you'll want to head to the pool area of the map. </p> <p>The duck can be found right by the pool ladder, right by the edge of the water. Again, go and interact with the glowing yellow light, and you'll have secured your third and final interaction, thus completing the challenge! </p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Epic Games</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Rockstar Games is aiming to prove <em>Red Dead Online</em> is anything but "dead", as the online multiplayer promises a massive overhaul this summer. It's been pistols at dawn recently, with disgruntled players calling out Rockstar for a string of lackluster updates. As <em>Red Dead Online</em> enters a new era, rest assured that the acclaimed developer is trying to fix the wheels on this wagon.</p> <p>Recent <em>RDO</em> updates have added new career paths and abilities - like the chance to make your one moonshine - but just like Rockstar revamped <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> with Heists in 2015, fans have been hoping for more. While we're not quite sure a Heist-style revamp is on the way, the developer has teased something big.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <h2>What is the Red Dead Online update?</h2> <p> </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1402326787082891266?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Red Dead Online's early summer update will add all kinds of new unlawful ventures, including opportunities to rob camps and homesteads: <a href="https://t.co/jpH68TFNe0">https://t.co/jpH68TFNe0</a> <a href="https://t.co/9mX8l7zxTG">pic.twitter.com/9mX8l7zxTG</a></p> — Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1402326787082891266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Posting on Twitter, the official Rockstar account confirmed there will soon be "all kinds of new unlawful ventures, including opportunities to rob camps and homesteads". The big takeaway is the ability to rob homesteads when playing <em>Red Dead Online</em>. Similar to how it works in <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>'s single-player world, you'll presumably head to a location and follow the clues to find a chest or stockpile that can be looted.</p> <p>Much like <em>RDR2</em>, there's likely to be a morality system that'll make you think twice about robbing innocents. Expanding about what's on the way in a <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/75oak7725k4357/bonus-yields-on-collectible-sets?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=114:bonuses-and-discounts-20210608" target="_blank" data-anchor="?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=114:bonuses-and-discounts-20210608">blog post</a>, Rockstar explained how the update will "include the ability to rob homesteads across the five states in Free Roam, as well as open up new avenues for personal enrichment. And like any good opportunity, this one is devoid of upfront expenditures". Added to this, there's an all-new membership rewards club and more details "coming soon". </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>When will we see the Red Dead Online update?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/OldRowTwitch/status/1400192566688108546?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Red dead online be like: <a href="https://t.co/bSTtGw3Mf2">pic.twitter.com/bSTtGw3Mf2</a></p> — Old Row Gaming (@OldRowTwitch) <a href="https://twitter.com/OldRowTwitch/status/1400192566688108546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 2, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>There's no clear release date on when we'll get to rob homesteads, other than a loose mention of "summer". Thankfully, it looks like it will be free to all. Unlike the Moonshiner role requiring players to buy a shack, looting camps and homesteads should be an automatic rollout. It'll be interesting to see how looting rival players' camps will work because we don't fancy booting up the game to find all our stockpiles have been nabbed by others while we've been away.</p> <p>Even if the upcoming update isn't quite the introduction of Mexico that we continue to ask for, it's still a step in the right direction. We'll have to wait and see what else is included in the update, but here's hoping it's more than just robberies on the horizon. It's been nearly two years since <em>RDO</em> released, and keen for the game to live up to the hype of the main series, Rockstar isn't planning on letting this horse wander off into the desert anytime soon. </p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Rockstar Games</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>To say that the OpTic Gaming dynasty ended on good terms would be a bald-faced lie, despite fairytale dreams that the greatest roster in <a href="/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> history could one day sit on the same couch and reminisce. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>The roster of Seth "<a rel="noopener" href="/players/scump/" target="_blank" title="Scump"><strong>Scump</strong></a>" Abner, Damon "<strong>Karma</strong>" Barlow, Ian "<a rel="noopener" href="/players/crimsix/" target="_blank" title="Crimsix"><strong>Crimisx</strong></a>" Porter, and Matthew "<strong>FormaL</strong>" Piper have a combined 13 major championship trophies to their name, with another five attributed to the dynasty with stand-ins from Matthew "<a rel="noopener" href="/streamers/nadeshot/" target="_blank" title="Nadeshot"><strong>Nadeshot</strong></a>" Haag and Ian "<strong>Enable</strong>" Wyatt.</p> <p>The OpTic dynasty was topped off with a World Championship win in the <em>Infinite Warfare</em> era, crowning the roster as the best team to ever grace the game. </p> <p>However, as the team split, Crimsix was left as an outcast, falling out with best-man-to-be Scump and his AR duo FormaL. </p> <p>With Crim heading to Dallas Empire, the now-three-time world champion has a more than a frayed relationship with his former dynasty teammates. Even though he and Scump have set their differences aside to form an unofficial players union, it appears the ever-vocal FormaL has not buried the hatchet. </p> <h2>FormaL Claims OpTic Should Have Dropped Crimsix In Black Ops 3</h2> <p>Speaking in an OpTic content series FormaL was faced with the question of "who do you wish you dropped but never did?" in which he immediately answered "Crimsix".</p> <p>The OpTic Chicago man also added that they should have dropped Crimsix during the <em>Black Ops 3</em> era, which would have seen the dynasty ripped apart prior to their <em>Infinite Warfare</em> triumph.</p> <p><strong><em>Clip Starts At 1:35</em></strong></p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/oRGlGe4GtEs?t=96" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oRGlGe4GtEs?start=96&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <h2>Crimsix And FormaL Clash On Twitter Following Comments About Dropping</h2> <p>As the clip went viral, the two pros headed to Twitter to continue the real-life blows at each other. Crimsix opened the dialogue by claiming that if he was dropped in Black Ops 3 he would have simply joined the championship-winning nV roster instead of Jordan "JKap" Kaplan. However, FormaL was quick to correct the fantasy, pointing out that in reality, he cost OpTic a crucial tie by incorrectly using his Active Camo at champs.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/FormaL/status/1402310881040609287?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">that plot would be sweet!

Crim added, "Imagine scumming your brothers out of $6-7k because of pure selfishness."</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Crimsix/status/1402317344924442629?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">And I don’t even give a flying fuck about the money, it’s the thought of looking you in the face and realizing that this human being in front of me actually fucking did that, that you’re capable of doing that.</p> — Empire C6 (@Crimsix) <a href="https://twitter.com/Crimsix/status/1402317344924442629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>FormaL hit back saying that "You should just be happy you got a free ring for literally doing meh the whole tournament", insinuating that they carried Crimsix to a much bigger winning than the $6-7,000 payout from the MVP winnings.</p> <p>The two ended the conflict with Crimsix pointing out that he would never have got his third World Championships ring should he never have been dropped by OpTic and picked up by Dallas Empire. </p> <p>Whilst FormaL took the last swing by calling the ring into dispute as it was won online, rather than on LAN. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/FormaL/status/1402322412625182720?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">You hold that online one dear to your heart huh?

        <![CDATA[ <p><a href="/far-cry-6"><em>Far Cry</em></a> as a series has been host to a multitude of themes, vistas, and ideas over the years. Since Vaas introduced a lot of players to the series in <em>Far Cry 3</em>, the series has shown a willingness to change and adapt, and <em>Far Cry 6 </em>doesn’t look to be much different.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>In fact, perhaps more so after the game’s controversial ‘politics’ conversation led narrative director Navid Khavari to confront the game’s tether to world events head-on. And now, it looks as though the game is about to take on something entirely new.</p> <h2>Far Cry 6 Will Feature Third-Person</h2> <p><img src="/media/gzgec01n/dani-far-cry-6.jpg?width=500&amp;height=286.88524590163934" alt="Far Cry 6 Uses Third Person" width="500" height="286.88524590163934"></p> <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/far-cry-6-features-third-person-gameplay-so-players-can-connect-to-dani-and-their-journey/1100-6492316/">GameSpot</a>, Khavari suggests that <em>Far Cry 6 </em>will be the first game in the franchise’s history to utilise a third-person view. He speaks candidly in an emailed response to the site - “In cinematics, [third-person] is something the team tried early on, and it felt surprisingly seamless. It instantly felt like there was more of a connection to Dani [<em>Far Cry 6’</em>s protagonist]’s journey in the world, more of a connection to this epic story in Yara.”</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>However, before you third-person shooter fans get too excited, it might not run through the whole game.</p> <h2>Far Cry 6’s Third-Person Is Not Permanent</h2> <p><img src="/media/ps3nrczt/far-cry-6-molotov.jpg?width=500&amp;height=250" alt="Far Cry 6 Uses Third Person" width="500" height="250"></p> <p>Of course, the game takes place mostly in the first-person mode as is customary for the <em>Far Cry </em>series. The game will utilise moments of third-person views (think chase scenes and the like), but it won’t be available as its choice of view for the rest of the game. <em>Far Cry 6 </em>is still strictly a first-person title until the story beckons for the use of the view. You’ll be able to see Dani speaking to NPCs a-la <em>The Witcher </em>and walk around hubs over their shoulder, but for the bulk of the gameplay, you’ll be in first-person.</p> <p>It’s an interesting touch for the <em>Far Cry </em>series, and it’s a bold step for the team to take - but given the scope of the 6th mainline installment, it’s in keeping with the game’s ambition. And who knows, it could become a new staple for the series.</p> <p><em>Images via Ubisoft</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Ludwig Anders Ahgren has been slapped with an Instagram instaban, after the popular streamer posted a seemingly inappropriate picture from the Logan Paul and Floyd Mayweather fight. The June 6 fight saw the YouTube sensation and boxing champion lace up their gloves and duke it out in a fight for the ages. Controversially, neither side won, but both walked away with millions in their pocket.</p> <p>There was a star-studded audience at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida, with Ludwig being in attendance. Fresh off his r<a rel="noopener" href="/articles/xqc-twitch-subathon" target="_blank">ecord-breaking Twitch subathon</a>, Ludwig was there to watch the "Bragging Rights" fight. Stepping into the ring (not to fight), Ludwig took a comical picture that has landed him in some hot water.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <h2>Why is Ludwig banned from Instagram?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1402094753466904584?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">GOT BANNED FOR A WEEK ON INSTA FOR POSTING THIS EXACT PIC LMAO</p> — ludwig (@LudwigAhgren) <a href="https://twitter.com/LudwigAhgren/status/1402094753466904584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Posting on Twitter, Ludwig joked, "Met Joe Rogan at the fight". Although the 25-year-old wasn't actually posing alongside the UFC commentator, he was snapped alongside a friend, with the pair poking their fingers through the zipper of their pants. It was just a bit of a blue joke, but Instagram clearly wasn't laughing. When Ludwig shared the same image to the social media platform, Instagram quickly gave him a week-long ban for presumably going against its terms and conditions.</p> <p>It's unclear exactly why Ludwig was banned, but it's likely to do with the image being deemed inappropriate. Even though it's obvious Ludwig and friend "Slime" aren't touching penises, Instagram likely deemed it against its community guidelines. Instead of just removing the post, the fact Ludwig has been banned for a week suggests it might not be his first offense.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>When will Ludwig stop being banned from Instagram?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP4VtiGtiF5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artPost artInsta"> <blockquote style="background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 360px; min-width: 326px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);" class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP4VtiGtiF5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13"> <div style="padding: 16px;"> <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: center;"> <div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 50%; flex-grow: 0; height: 40px; margin-right: 14px; width: 40px;"></div> <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center;"> <div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 100px;"></div> <div style="background-color: #f4f4f4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 60px;"></div> </div> </div> <div style="padding: 19% 0;"></div> <div style="display: block; height: 50px; margin: 0 auto 12px; width: 50px;"></div> <div style="padding-top: 8px;"> <div style="color: #3897f0; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: 550; line-height: 18px;">View this post on Instagram</div> </div> <p style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;"><a style="color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" rel="noopener" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CP4VtiGtiF5/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" target="_blank">A post shared by Ludwig Ahgren (@ludwigahgren)</a></p> </div> </blockquote> </div> </div> <p>At the time of writing, a censored version of Ludwig in the ring is on his Instagram, but the offending post has been removed. With the seven-day ban expected to end on June 14, he doesn't have long left. Interestingly, Ahgren's ban comes just days after girlfriend QTCinderella was also banned from the site.</p> <p>According to reports QTCinderella and WillNeff are currently banned from Instagram when the pair were mass reported in the midst of drama with Adin Ross. Things bizarrely boiled over after a heated game of <em>Super Mario 64</em> speedrunning, with QT writing, "Yo Instagram, please help me and my friend WillNeff,” she wrote. “We got banned due to mass reporting from very cool kids. We actually did nothing wrong besides play instruments in high school. Please help". Despite Ludwig's ban not being related to the above drama, it's not been a good week for the celebrity pairing. </p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Instagram</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>As part of the wave of hype around the latest Battlefield game’s reveal coming tomorrow, some fans are convinced that the title of the game will be <em>BATTLEFIELD 2042.</em></p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>Popular leaker and Battlefield insider Tom Henderson recently tweeted the suggestion that the game would be named as such and then received a reply from a fan containing what looks like a screenshot of the official <em>Battlefield </em>website, revealing a portion of the box art and a slightly obscured QR code.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/datguyful/status/1402286433210077186?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/iy4afFD4iU">pic.twitter.com/iy4afFD4iU</a></p> — Ful (@datguyful) <a href="https://twitter.com/datguyful/status/1402286433210077186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>As if to confirm the news, Henderson then quoted the tweet to his followers with the hashtag #Battlefield2042.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1402286625963577346?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BATTLEFIELD2042?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BATTLEFIELD2042</a> <a href="https://t.co/BZeHFwHs9H">https://t.co/BZeHFwHs9H</a></p> — Tom Henderson (@_Tom_Henderson_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1402286625963577346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Henderson, despite previously suggesting that the game would be called simply <em>BATTLEFIELD</em> is a reliable name in the world of leaks for DICE’s shooter title and has been the person to turn to for news on the new title.</p> <p><img src="/media/ragnmpr5/battlefield-4.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="New Battlefield Game Reportedly Titled ‘Battlefield 2042’" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>There’s no confirmation as to where the image has come from and how reliable it or Henderson’s confidence is, but only time will tell if it comes to be true. Either way, we’re excited to see the full reveal come tomorrow, and if the title crosses over, then that means a lot of Henderson’s previous assumptions of the game could easily come to be true.</p> <p><em>Images via DICE</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>The invasion has arrived. Aliens have overtaken the <a href="/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a> island. The only thing standing in their way is you and the Imagined Order (IO). Together, you must hold off the alien army and save the island.</p> <p>This new <em>Fortnite</em> season is chock-full of surprises and interesting additions. Players can use the aliens’ technology against them, controlling flyable UFOs and wielding new, advanced weaponry.</p> <p>There are new weapons to Craft, and some fan-favourites have returned. New locations and creatures to discover. And did we mention new <a href="/articles/how-to-get-free-skins-in-fortnite">skins and cosmetics</a>?</p> <p>Let’s take a deeper look at <em>Fortnite’s</em> newest season and see what these aliens have to offer.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/0GxSgk4uWeU" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GxSgk4uWeU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <h1>New Battle Pass and Cosmetics</h1> <p>Chapter 2 - Season 7 brings with it a brand new Battle Pass. Highlights of the Season 7 Battle Pass include Rick Sanchez from the <em>Rick and Morty</em> animated television series and Superman, the iconic DC superhero. Additionally, players will be able to create their own custom alien as a skin.</p> <p>The way you earn rewards in the Season 7 Battle Pass has also been revamped. Players will collect Alien Artifacts throughout the season to claim additional styles for certain Battle Pass skins. Furthermore, Battle Stars are back. Battle Stars can be used to claim rewards in the order of your choice.</p> <h1>Control a UFO</h1> <p>Chapter 2 - Season 7 will allow players to fly their very own UFO. Flying Saucers controlled by aliens patrol the skies of the map. Players can takedown or hijack these futuristic ships and pilot them themselves.</p> <p>UFOs have a bundle of tools at their disposal. Players can fire a high-powered cannon or use the abduction beam to toss cars and other scrap around. These Flying Saucers can even be used to Reboot fallen comrades.</p> <p><img src="/media/juqjfa3e/fortnite-kymera-ray-gun-1920x1080-b270e257378a.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Fortnite Aliens" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <h1>New Alien Weaponry</h1> <p>The aliens have arrived and brought their advanced arsenals with them. In total, there are four new advanced weapons at our disposal in Season 7. These include:</p> <ul> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Kymera Ray Gun</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Pulse Rifle</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Recon Scanner</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Rail Gun</li> </ul> <p>The Kymera Ray Gun fires a continuous laser beam with infinite ammo. The only thing holding it back is the recharge time.</p> <p>The Pulse Rifle is fully automatic when hip-fired with slower shots when aimed down sight.</p> <p>The Recon Scanner is less of an offensive tool and more of a well, recon device. The Recon Scanner can be used to reveal enemies and Chests in the proximity. Players can use this nifty device to gain intel on the situation.</p> <p>The Rail Gun is an advanced version of a sniper rifle. This new gun can fire high-damage beams through surfaces. But be wary; each shot will attract a ton of attention.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h1>New Craftable Weapons</h1> <p>The <a href="/articles/how-to-craft-in-fortnite">Crafting System</a> is back with an overhaul. Gone are Primal and Makeshift weapons. Chapter 2 - Season 7 has players using a new crafting material: Nuts and Bolts. Nuts and Bolts can be fused with a standard gun to recreate previously Vaulted weapons. The AUG, Rapid Fire SMG, and the Lever Action Shotgun are this season’s crafted weapons.</p> <p><img src="/media/0qiifv0b/fortnite-chapter-2-season-7-crafting-1920x1080-bc151eda5dba.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Fortnite Crafting Weapons" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <h1>Vaulted And Unvaulted Weapons</h1> <p>In addition to the new Craftable weapons, Chapter 2 - Season 7 includes the return of some fan-favourites. The following weapons and items are back from the Vault in Season 7:</p> <ul> <li>Silenced SMG</li> <li>Heavy Assault Rifle</li> <li>Launch Pad</li> <li>Bolt Action Sniper Rifle</li> <li>Hand Cannon</li> <li>Supply Chests</li> <li>Vending Machines</li> </ul> <p>In exchange, all Primal and Makeshift weapons have been sent to the Vault.</p> <p><img src="/media/fy2jebbg/cropped-34.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Fortnite Season 7 Locations" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <h1>New Points Of Interest (POIs)</h1> <p>Despite the alien onslaught, the <em>Fortnite</em> island remains largely untouched - at least for now.</p> <p>There are just two new POIs on the map. This includes Believer Beach and Corny Complex. Despite the new names, these locations aren’t entirely new. Believer Beach is basically a remaster of Sweaty Sands. Believer Beach is just a lot messier and has been remodelled by alien enthusiasts.</p> <p>Corny Complex replaces Colossal Crops. Corny Complex is a massive piece of farmland with a twist. Beneath the surface is an IO base filled with secrets.</p> <p>The Spire that stood in the island’s centre for the entirety of Chapter 2 - Season 6, along with the Zero Point, is now gone. It was destroyed by the aliens and replaced with a strange purple mutation.</p> <p>There are many other small changes throughout the island, but these are the major ones.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1402194380841160704?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Alive Llamas Footage!

To start, we have Henchmen Chests and Cosmic Chests.</p> <p>The Mothership above the island will abduct players at random. If this happens to you, you’ll have 15 seconds to loot Henchmen Chests inside the alien spacecraft. You must use these 15 seconds to build your perfect loadout before being spit back onto the island’s surface.</p> <p>Cosmic Chests are a form of chest locked in a purple crystal. These chests can only be opened with the help of a squadmate. Players must take turns smashing the crystal’s weak points until it eventually breaks. Squads that manage to break open these Cosmic Chests will be rewarded handsomely.</p> <p>Finally, we have Loot Llamas - that are alive. You read that right. The previously stoic Loot Llamas have come to life. These Loot Llamas run around the map, dropping loot like candy when shot at.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1402208815949434882?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Cosmic Chest Gameplay with <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShiinaBR</a> &amp; <a href="https://twitter.com/Guille_GAG?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Guille_GAG</a> <br><br>It drops insane loot, I'll tell y'all the loot pool of it later today! <a href="https://t.co/wFRI3yLObq">pic.twitter.com/wFRI3yLObq</a></p> — HYPEX - Fortnite Leaks (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1402208815949434882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <h1>Alien Parasites</h1> <p>The aliens have brought blood-sucking parasites with them. These nasty creatures will attach to a player’s head and leech their health from them. However, it’s sort of a symbiotic relationship. In exchange for your health, these Alien Parasites will grant their host extra speed and jump height. Maybe an alien partner isn't so bad after all.</p> <p>If you want to rid yourself of your new friend, you can burn it with fire or pry it off in the water.</p> <p>Our once peaceful primal island has been overrun by futuristic aliens. This culture shock brings with it new guns, vehicles, locations, creatures, and cosmetics. You have the intel; now it’s time to get out there and send those aliens back where they came from.<br><br></p> <p><em>Images via Epic Games</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Schalke 04 has started off the <a href="/league-of-legends/" title="LOL"><em>League of Legends</em></a> European Championships 2021 season in a much better fashion than their previous season, of which the side struggled to adapt to the outside conditions surrounding the world and failed to make the top four in either of the splits.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>After earning a bronze medal in the LEC Regional Finals back in 2019, their 2020 form was rather concerning, and clearly had an impact on the financial status of the organisation that also heavily relied upon the results of their parent football club.</p> <p>Although Shalke posted up a fourth-place finish at the Spring Split, the org has been rumoured to be shopping their LEC slot, with the football club facing relegation from the Bundesliga and a lack of ticket sales leaving a huge dent in the finances of the club.</p> <p>Now, Schalke representatives have confirmed that they are in talks to sell the $36 million LEC slot.</p> <h2>Schalke representatives confirm LEC selling</h2> <p>According to <a rel="noopener" href="https://esportsobserver.com/s04-esports-confirms-talks-lec/?fbclid=IwAR2FePDD529L8Me11w2xsaHqzfhoRvIxb7AnC43_rSaMODYVcyaiCYzI3xU" target="_blank" data-anchor="?fbclid=IwAR2FePDD529L8Me11w2xsaHqzfhoRvIxb7AnC43_rSaMODYVcyaiCYzI3xU">reports from TEO</a>, Schalke 04 Esports Managing Director Tim Reichert confirmed that the organization is "in discussions with an undisclosed party or parties but, 'there is no final decision yet.'" </p> <p>Reichert also added that the organisation will have an update within two weeks.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://youtu.be/6ULcZoPvxf0" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ULcZoPvxf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p class="t-24 t-black t-bold full-width">FC Schalke 04 Media Relations Manager Sascha Marx also said:<span> </span>“We have always said, that selling parts of our esports business would be a way to generate income.

The most likely outcome is that the org will remain in the LEC until the end of the season, with the roster continuing to try and qualify for Worlds.</p> <p class="t-24 t-black t-bold full-width">Should a new organisation enter the scene, they will then have the opportunity to keep the roster together, or shop for their own targets in the off-season, rendering the likes of Sergen "Broken Blade" Çelik teamless.</p> <p class="t-24 t-black t-bold full-width">No word has yet been spilt as to who will be purchasing the LEC spot, and whether or not the unnamed party intends to keep the roster intact.</p> <p class="t-24 t-black t-bold full-width"> </p> <p class="t-24 t-black t-bold full-width"><em>Image via Riot Games</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>Fans are sure to splash their Simoleons, as Electronic Arts teases a brand new expansion for <em>The Sims 4</em>. It's hard to believe we've only been playing <em>Sims</em> games since 2000, but with 21 years of various main entries and expansions, the series has become a staple of our lives.</p> <p>While you likely have fond memories of diving under the covers for <em>Hot Date</em>, sawing your loved ones in half with <em>Makin' Magic</em>, or meeting man's best friend in <em>Pets</em>, the franchise has continued to churn out expansions as we've headed into <em>The Sims 4</em>. Even though the game came out in 2014, <em>The Sims 4</em> has consistently delivered expansions, with the latest being <em>Snowy Escape</em> in November 2020.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <h2>What is The Sims 4 countryside expansion?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/lilsimsie/status/1401917464624177153?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">heard from an old friend today xx <a href="https://t.co/7EQqsUnduY">pic.twitter.com/7EQqsUnduY</a></p> — Kayla (@lilsimsie) <a href="https://twitter.com/lilsimsie/status/1401917464624177153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>News of a new expansion for <em>The Sims 4</em> is nothing new, however, we have our first real hint at a countryside theme ahead of an official release by EA on June 10. Content creator and <em>Sims </em>fanatic Kayla Sims posted on Twitter and showed off a viral marketing package from the developer. The mock postcard featured a serene scene and the message, "Greetings from Henford-on-Bagley". With the UK known for its locations like Stratford-upon-Avon and Newcastle upon Tyne, it's our biggest clue yet about what's on the way.</p> <p>On the back of the postcard, there's a message from "A &amp; A Crumplebottom" - confirming the return of the iconic dynasty that was first introduced in <em>The Sims 2</em>. The Crumplebottoms invites players to join them at a garden stall and add, "We are so pleased you're joining us in Henford-on-Bagley!". There's a mention of "the quaint countryside life", which sounds like a move away from the usual buzz of the city-inspired <em>Sims</em> games and their suburban offshoots.</p> <h2>What does The Sims 4 countryside expansion mean?</h2> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/soloveysolitude/status/1401946858067480576?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">manifesting a sims 4 farm pack with british farmlands and fkn highland cattle and small scale farming with bagpipes and FAIRIES and not industrialized mid western american farming <br /><br />please i love fairies so much i want them in my game</p> — pettson's tears | happy pride month 🏳️‍🌈 (@soloveysolitude) <a href="https://twitter.com/soloveysolitude/status/1401946858067480576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>Various influencers and <em>Sims</em> stalwarts have been given the same postcard, so all eyes are on June 10 at 8 am PT for an official reveal. For as long as we can remember, players have been asking for some sort of farming element to cash in on the success of rival titles. The mention of a garden stall has gamers guessing that they'll finally be able to plant their own crops and then sell their wares for a tidy profit. </p> <p>Importantly, a countryside expansion would be a series first as we head to the lush greenery of the British backcountry. Similar to how Pokemon swapped its usual backdrop for the United Kingdom-inspired Galar Region in <em>Sword and Shield</em>, it looks like EA is following suit.</p> <p>Considering Sims speak their own language, don't expect to see some dodgy English accents, but then again, we're expecting EA will have made all the residents of Henfor-on-Bagley extremely posh. To be honest, we wouldn't be surprised if they all wear bowler hats and only drink tea. Thankfully, there isn't long until we find out what <em>The Sims 4 </em>is working on.</p> <p> </p> <p><em>Images via Electronic Arts</em></p> ]]>

Collaborating with Prime Gaming to offer players free cosmetics was a great turn for players and has given many fans a reason to keep coming back to the ga ]]>
        <![CDATA[ me.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <p>It’s clear that cosmetics are important to <em>VALORANT</em> fans, and the fans are important to <em>VALORANT</em>. With this in mind, Riot Games conceived a way to give back to fans for tuning in to their new Duality video, offering them a new player card for doing so. But, it didn’t all go quite to plan.</p> <h2>VALORANT’s Duality Card Blunder</h2> <p><img src="/media/4capzc4g/valorant-duality-player-card.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="VALORANT Give Players Free Item After Blunder" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <p>To coincide with the new story video Riot Games released recently, they unveiled a new player card that was free to download for a brief 48 hour period, offering a code to be redeemed on the <em>VALORANT </em>site for the item. However, the plan hit a snag.</p> <p>Traffic to the site was overwhelming, and so many people were making attempts to download the item that the site was struggling to keep up, and the code entry simply wasn’t working for many.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>In response to the immense demand for the card, the official <em>VALORANT </em>Twitter page voiced a change of plans.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1399431893725061125?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">We know a lot of you have been trying to claim your free Duality Player Card. We're working with our partners to stabilize the code redemption tool as we continue to experience a high volume of traffic. We'll be removing the time limit and expiration on the code.</p> — VALORANT (@PlayVALORANT) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1399431893725061125?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p>They suggested that the time limit will be stripped away to make room for players to claim the item, but since, another change of plan has been issued. And hopefully, it’s the last one.</p> <p><img src="/media/wdzgs5ka/valorant-closed-beta-begins-in-april_k5sb-1280.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="VALORANT Give Players Free Item After Blunder" width="500" height="281.25"></p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <h2>How To Claim The Free VALORANT Duality Card</h2> <p>A new solution has been offered to fans, and hopefully, it’ll bring an end to the Duality card saga. In fact, many are wondering why this didn’t come around in the first place, as <em>VALORANT</em>’s plan to give the card to players is to just… give it to them. The Duality Card will appear in players’ inventory soon, according to an official tweet.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/PlayVALORANT/status/1402037655307702274?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">Due to the issues with our code redemption process, we're granting all players the Duality player card! You should see the card appear in your inventory soon.

This elongated stumble might have been a lot of stress for the Riot team, but, at least we’ll still get our free item. Wear it like a badge of honour - you were present during the great Duality blunder of 2021.</p> <p><em>Images via Riot Games</em></p> ]]>

        <![CDATA[ <p>In the wake of one era fizzling out, another one is bright on the horizon. The two-peat is happening, folks; the Dallas Fuel are going to win <a href="/overwatch/" title="Overwatch"><em>Overwatch</em> </a>League’s June Joust. The reigning  May Melee champions look primed and ready to capture gold in Hawai’i, and their narrative whispers echoes of a similar road to glory. Is it their style? The individual players? Or some strange amalgamation of all three? Either way, Dallas is quickly charting a course of repeat success and forging its own era of dominance—and it all starts with their capstone; the June Joust title.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div> </div> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adDCPpGtZes&amp;ab_channel=DallasFuelDallasFuelVerified" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/adDCPpGtZes?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p> </p> <p>To say that the Dallas Fuel is star-studded would be a drastic understatement. It was clear from the gun that this was going to be the best iteration of the Fuel that the <em>Overwatch</em> League has seen thus far. However, expectations have been shattered—and not just at the organisational level. Dallas is home to some of the best individual players in the league, and that is not on the docket for today’s debate. </p> <p>Surprising no one, main tank Lee "<strong>Fearless</strong>" Eui-Seok is continuing to rack up accolades. As it stands now, Fearless is currently ranked as the number one overall player according to IBM Watson’s power rankings and leads the league in hero damage done per ten minutes as well as eliminations per ten minutes on Winston.</p> <p>Having a stand out performance throughout the June Joust, flex support ace Kwon "<strong>Fielder</strong>" Joon is ranked as the highest support according to IBM Watson’s power rankings. Past that, during the June Joust qualifiers as well as the playoffs, Fielder has had the highest healing per ten minutes across all heroes. This clocks him in with about 22,465 healing per ten minutes; the second-highest in that particular category is Florida Mayhem’s support Kang "<strong>Gangnamjin</strong>" Nam-jin with 18,440. </p> <p>That is a massive 4,025 healing per ten minutes delta.</p> <p>And it doesn’t stop there. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>Criminally underrated and not talked enough about, Choi "<strong>Hanbin</strong>" Han-been has been on a tear this month. His D.Va performance thus far leads the June Joust in finals blows, hero damage done, and eliminations per ten minutes. </p> <p>However, it’s not just that the Dallas Fuel has strong players, anyone with a modicum of <em>Overwatch</em> knowledge can tell you that, but it’s how they operate that leads to igniting dangerous playoff implications.</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdJN7eUM3W8&amp;ab_channel=GGReconGGRecon" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdJN7eUM3W8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p> </p> <p>Taking what the Fuel used to win the May Melee and dialling up the aggression brings us to the current iteration of their style. They thrive when allowed to engage, and when they do, they nearly always land with a pick. And with a healthy ultimate engine, that snowball rarely stops rolling. Take, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/Qsfqb4Fl9M4?t=6622">this map against the Florida Mayhem</a>. Their initial pick onto the enemy Echo leads into Fielder and Kim "<strong>SP9RK1E</strong>" Yeong-han building their ultimates. Fielder’s Coalescence covers Fearless in the ensuing fight allowing him to build his Primal Rage quicker. This chain reaction of ultimates building ultimates isn’t anything new, but it’s the consistency at which the Fuel find solid ground with their initial engagements. </p> <p>The Fuel sits among the league’s best with a 49.6% first elimination rate. This means roughly in half the teamfights, they find the first pick. While not too surprising, their transition rate from those picks is stunning. After finding the first elimination in a team fight in the June Joust, the Dallas Fuel has an 84.5% win rate. And that’s just when the pre-fight goes their way. If we look at the inverse, the Fuel rarely gets picked first. With a 47.7% first death rate, this sits the Fuel near the middle of the pack. However, they’re one of the best teams at fighting from their backfoot. After suffering the first death, Dallas maintains a 25.8% in win rate. To put that in perspective, only four other teams are higher than them in that metric. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRjpwcZ5rLY&amp;ab_channel=DallasFuelDallasFuelVerified" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <div class="artVideo"><iframe width="360" height="203" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XRjpwcZ5rLY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div> </div> <p> </p> <p>Stylistically, as much as we’d like to claim the Fuel’s narrative is around their aggressive, all-in focused style, Dallas has dabbled with slower tempo compositions. In their Temple Of Anubis defence against the Shock, the Fuel took the old double-shield archetype and splashed in SP9RK1E’s Junkrat for good measure. While it didn’t find inherently purchase, it does hold value. This example, albeit small, shows that the Fuel are at least open to playing something different on certain maps if the metagame were to shift—and it has. </p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem"> <div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div> </div> <p>If we’re to nitpick, if we’re to find some flaw for the Fuel, Escort looks to be a likely candidate for a problematic game type for Dallas. Glancing at the map pool, Escort has Junkertown, Rialto, and Dorado. These are maps that give defending teams long sightlines that hitscan heroes like Ashe and Widowmaker can abuse. The problem is, Dallas does not yet have the capability to answer that threat. Instead, they have to piecemeal their dive and attempt to close the distance into these defensive positions. And with the metagame showing a recent trend towards Orisa based compositions, this makes those dives even more difficult. This shift does beg the question; can the Fuel maintain form against teams that pilot that against them?</p> <div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/DallasFuel/status/1401678468681699328" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360"> <p dir="ltr">two peat. 💙 <a href="https://t.co/KLC0RlpSHP">pic.twitter.com/KLC0RlpSHP</a></p> — Dallas Fuel (@DallasFuel) <a href="https://twitter.com/DallasFuel/status/1401678468681699328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2021</a></blockquote> </div> <p> </p> <p>Both the New York Excelsior and the Atlanta Reign have benefited from the recent meta shift. Slower compositions that aim to catch incoming dives and limit the ability of the enemy Echo to patrol the map uncontested are now the flavour of the month. Heroes like McCree, Baptiste, and Brigitte all seem to be in vogue at the moment, but this isn’t anything the Dallas Fuel hasn’t already had to deal with. Both the Houston Outlaws and the Los Angeles Gladiators tried and failed to wield similar compositions against the Fuel to thwart another trek to Hawai’i. With that said, it’s more than fair to say that Dallas should be favoured over both of these teams. </p> <p>And as much as it seems like flowery poetry, the Fuel’s May Melee rivals look to be their biggest threat in June as well. It is none other than the Shanghai Dragons that look the most capable of giving the Dallas Fuel the biggest run for their money. Not only do they look the most dominant on the new slower tempo, Orisa based compositions, but having such an aggressive Lucio like Lee "<strong>LeeJaeGon</strong>" Jae-gon in the mirror match-up alongside Kim "<strong>Fleta</strong>" Byung-sun gives them a myriad of weapons to abuse. </p> <p>However, being able to play the field doesn’t give you the same peaks that Dallas has consistently found. It does not historically win you titles—and it is clear that the Dallas Fuel are the best team at the Winston Rush metagame. They once again walk into a tournament with a clear and defined style that is difficult to prepare for, especially knowing how different their peers are, and that style is comfortable for them. They’ve walked this road before and conquered it once. Yes, this is a different set of bricks—but Since the pre-season, Dallas has been finding success on compositions not too dissimilar to the one they’ve leaned on throughout the June Joust. </p> <p><em>Overwatch</em> has always been kind to teams who understand the standard metagame practices of the time, but who invest in their own stylistic takes. And once again, the Fuel stands as the pillar to that idea. Dallas has found another peak and is going to be a problem moving forward. With the momentum of their recent performances, with the memories fresh in their mind from the May Melee, and with their stars burning bright, it is all déjà vu from here on out. </p> <p> </p> <p>This is the Dallas Fuel metagame, and they are here to collect—for the second time.</p> <p><br /><br /></p> <p><em>Images via Blizzard Entertainment</em></p> ]]>
