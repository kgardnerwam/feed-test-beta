<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>A few weeks ago, Upworthy shared the hilarious winners of the<a href="https://www.upworthy.com/comedy-wildlife-photo-winners" target="_blank"> 2021 Comedy Wildlife Photography Awards</a> and the winner was a well-timed shot of a monkey who appears to have hurt the family jewels on a suspension wire. (Don&apos;t worry folks, no monkeys were harmed for the awards.) </p><p>The awards were created six years ago by Tom Sullam and Paul Joynson-Hicks to promote positive awareness of animal welfare issues. The competition has been so successful, the duo decided to branch out and create the<a href="https://www.comedypetphoto.com/" target="_blank"> Comedy Pet Photo Awards, </a>where photographers can submit pictures of their furry friends for a &#xA3;2,000 ($2650) prize. <br></p><p>Donations generated by the competition go to Animal Support Angels, an animal welfare charity in the UK.</p><p>This year&apos;s winner is Zoe Ross for &quot;Whizz Pop,&quot; a photo of her labrador puppy Pepper who appears to be tooting bubbles.</p><p>&#x201C;We never ever thought that we would win but entered the competition because we loved the idea of helping a charity just by sending in a funny photo of Pepper,&quot; Ross said in a statement. &quot;She is such a little monkey, and very proud of herself, bringing in items from the garden and parading past you until you notice her. She is the happiest puppy we&#x2019;ve ever known and completely loved to pieces.&#x201D;</p><p>Here are the rest of the winners of the 2021 Comedy Pet Photo Awards.</p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="True" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/17-comedy-pet-photo-awards?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="overall-winner-zoe-ross-whizz-pop-penkridge-uk" data-post-id="2655939280" data-published-at="1638919523" data-use-pagination="False"> <h3 data-role="headline"> Overall Winner: Zoe Ross &quot;Whizz Pop,&quot; Penkridge, UK </h3> <figcaption></figcaption> <figcaption>&#xA9; Zoe Ross /Animal Friends Comedy Pet Photo Awards 2021</figcaption> <p>Did this puppy swallow a bubble?</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="True" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/17-comedy-pet-photo-awards?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" data-basename="best-dog-category-carmen-cromer-jurassic-bark-pittsboro-north-carolina" data-post-id="2655939280" data-published-at="1638919523" data-use-pagination="False"> <h3 data-role="headline"> Best Dog Category: Carmen Cromer &quot;Jurassic Bark,&quot; Pittsboro, North Carolina </h3> <figcaption></figcaption> <figcaption>&#xA9; Carmen Cromer/Animal Friends Comedy Pet Photo Awards 2021</figcaption> <p>&quot;My golden retriever, Clementine, loves to stick her face in front of the hose while I water the plants.

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>Sometimes magic happens in real life. And when it does, it has all the makings of a viral video. </p><p>People walking the streets of Dubai got to watch in delight as Aladdin effortlessly glided through the crowds on his iconic flying carpet. At one point he even sailed across the water. It&#x2019;s no wonder this IRL Disney scene now has more than 100,000 views on YouTube.</p><hr><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/flying-aladdin-real-life?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655933123" data-published-at="1638836113" data-use-pagination="False"> <span style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="830502b9552235cf0d2e053ab91fb335"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K7rhOoX8dAc?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></span> <p>Content creator @RhyzOrDie posted on Instagram that the idea had been &#x201C;brewing&#x201D; in his head for eight months. And on Halloween, he had finally been able to execute it using PVC pipes, a longboard and an insanely accurate &#x201C;Aladdin as Prince Ali&#x201D; costume. That&#x2019;s right, no wishes were used in the making of this video, but rather some simple engineering skills along with a dash of movie magic. </p><p>The surfing part was the most difficult portion of the stunt. In a follow-up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oWC_kp19hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behind-the-scenes</a> video, we see a not so graceful Aladdin trying&#x2014;and failing&#x2014;several times to stay on top of the e-foil board long enough to get the shot. &#x201C;They&#x2019;re pretty difficult to ride, coming from somebody who has endured board sports his whole entire life,&#x201D; he told viewers. But success finally came and with a bit of CGI, you really get the illusion that he is floating mid air &#x2026; perhaps on his way to whisk Princess Jasmine off her feet. </p><p>@RhyzorDie said that this labor of love was created in part to encourage others that if they can &#x201C;envision it,&#x201D; they can &#x201C;make it happen.&#x201D; Just like Aladdin (eventually) learned in the movie, maybe we can learn to rely on our own creative resources, rather than waiting for a mystic genie to make it all happen for us. Amazing things can happen when we do. <br></p> </div><p></p><div class="post-pager js-listicle-pager" data-listicle-style data-async_load_parameters="platform=desktop&amp;display_ads=1&amp;settings=%7B%22enter_url%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_post_section%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_breaks%22%3A+null%2C+%22prevent_last_break_repetition%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_numeration%22%3A+false%2C+%22show_columns_on_mobile%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_order%22%3A+%5B2%5D%2C+%22turn_into_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22list_breaks%22%3A+null%2C+%22reorder_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22cooldown_in_seconds%22%3A+null%2C+%22pagination_order%22%3A+%5B%5D%2C+%22source%22%3A+%22post_listicle_settings%22%2C+%22next_post_url%22%3A+null%2C+%22up_down_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22allow_url_change%22%3A+true%2C+%22numeration_sort%22%3A+-1%2C+%22allow_url_update%22%3A+true%2C+%22use_pagination%22%3A+false%2C+%22body_text_above%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_ads%22%3A+false%2C+%22items_as_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22multiple_answers%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_redirect%22%3A+false%2C+%22is_guest_voting_allowed%22%3A+true%2C+%22layout_type%22%3A+1%2C+%22voting_extra_fields%22%3A+%7B%7D%7D"> </div></div> ]]>

Though she was renowned for her interview techniques and willingness to ask tough questions, sometimes her questions could be somewhat tactless. </p><p>Put those two together 44 years ago and you get a shining example of Parton&apos;s grace and wit in the face of tasteless questions about her looks, her breasts and criticisms lobbed at her. Parton has always been who she is and portrayed the outward appearances she wants to portray, and she calmly and deftly navigates Walters&apos; patronizing line of questioning with impressive poise.</p><p>Watch:</p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/dolly-parton-barbara-walters-interview?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655933065" data-published-at="1638839876" data-use-pagination="False"> <span style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="f7e34fbf745d30295eb279de76e8202f"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/If-oWqUYzlQ?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></span> <p>So much of Barbara Walters&apos; commentary and questioning comes across as condescending and judgmental, but Dolly Parton transforms that negativity into a positive portrayal of who she is, where she&apos;s from and what she&apos;s all about. </p><p>When Walters told her she was beautiful and didn&apos;t need the wig and the make-up and the outrageous clothes, Parton told her it was a choice she&apos;s making. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like to be like everybody else,&quot; she said. &#x201C;I would never stoop so low to be fashionable, that&#x2019;s the easiest thing in the world to do.</p><p>&quot;I&apos;m very real as far as my outlook on life and the way I care about people and the way I care about myself and the things I care about. I just chose to do this, and show business is a money-making joke and I&apos;ve just always liked telling jokes,&quot; she added.</p><p>Walters asked her if she ever feels that she is a joke, since people make fun of her.</p><p>&#x201C;Oh I know they make fun of me, but all these years the people have thought the joke was on me, but it&#x2019;s actually on them,&#x201D; said Parton. &#x201C;I am sure of myself as a person. I am sure of my talent. I&#x2019;m sure of my love for life and that sort of thing. I am very content, I like the kind of person that I am. So, I can afford to piddle around and do-diddle around with makeup and clothes and stuff because I am secure with myself.&#x201D;</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/dolly-parton-barbara-walters-interview?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2655933065" data-published-at="1638839876" data-use-pagination="False"> <p>The questions about Parton&apos;s breasts were particularly tacky, especially by today&apos;s standards. But Parton handled it all beautifully. Her responses are a masterclass in grace and her self-assurance is a refreshing model for us all&#x2014;especially now that we can see how she has stayed true to herself all these years. Anyone who has ever wondered why Dolly Parton&apos;s appearance is what it is will learn a lot from this interview, and anyone who wants to learn how to maintain dignity and class in the face of inconsideration will learn a lot as well. </p> </div><p></p><div class="post-pager js-listicle-pager" data-listicle-style data-async_load_parameters="platform=desktop&amp;display_ads=1&amp;settings=%7B%22enter_url%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_post_section%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_breaks%22%3A+%5B2%5D%2C+%22prevent_last_break_repetition%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_numeration%22%3A+false%2C+%22show_columns_on_mobile%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_order%22%3A+%5B2%5D%2C+%22turn_into_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22list_breaks%22%3A+null%2C+%22reorder_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22cooldown_in_seconds%22%3A+null%2C+%22pagination_order%22%3A+%5B%5D%2C+%22source%22%3A+%22post_listicle_settings%22%2C+%22next_post_url%22%3A+null%2C+%22up_down_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22allow_url_change%22%3A+true%2C+%22numeration_sort%22%3A+-1%2C+%22allow_url_update%22%3A+true%2C+%22use_pagination%22%3A+false%2C+%22body_text_above%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_ads%22%3A+true%2C+%22items_as_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22multiple_answers%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_redirect%22%3A+false%2C+%22is_guest_voting_allowed%22%3A+true%2C+%22layout_type%22%3A+1%2C+%22voting_extra_fields%22%3A+%7B%7D%7D"> </div></div> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>It&apos;s December in our second year of the pandemic, which means it&apos;s time for everyone&apos;s favorite game: &quot;Is it a cold or is it COVID?&quot; Any sniffles, sore throat or sinus pressure <em>could</em> be symptoms of COVID-19 infection, but the common cold is still alive and kicking, so you test and hope for the best. </p><p>Even the president of the United States is vulnerable to viruses, and the White House recently announced that President Biden has caught a cold. In addition to being double vaccinated and boosted, the president is tested for COVID-19 daily, so it does indeed appear to be just a cold. But the effect the cold virus is having on his voice is noteworthy, especially as it&apos;s making him sound exactly like actor George Clooney.</p><p>And when I say &quot;exactly,&quot; I mean <em>exactly. </em>Push play, look away and listen:</p><hr><p><br></p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/president-bidens-cold-makes-him-sound-like-george-clooney?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655938404" data-published-at="1638905712" data-use-pagination="False"> <div id="eaa33" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="7106355e47d0aa504b08b8c5ebaaa5ad"> <div class="rm-embed-container rm-embed-twitter rm-loading"> <span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-mobile" style="padding-bottom: 127%"></span> <span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-desktop" style="padding-bottom: 100%"></span> <div class="rm-embed-holder"> <blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-custom-tweet" data-twitter-tweet-id="1466799463389962242" data-partner="rebelmouse"> <div style="margin:1em 0">Biden: &quot;Over the last month, we&apos;ve seen oil and gas prices ... come down significantly.&quot;pic.twitter.com/dOLgP8H3VW</div> &#x2014; The Post Millennial (@The Post Millennial) <a href="https://twitter.com/TPostMillennial/statuses/1466799463389962242">1638547218</a> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <p>Uncanny, right? My husband heard it playing from across the room and thought it <em>was</em> George Clooney. So funny.</p><p>Biden has said that he got the cold from his 1-year-old grandson who&apos;d had a cold and who &quot;likes to kiss his &apos;pop.&apos;&quot; The presidential physician issued a memo late last week to explain the president&apos;s symptoms. </p><p><span></span>&#x201C;As is readily apparent, President Biden is experiencing some increased nasal congestion this week,&#x201D; Kevin C.

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>When Deidra Mayberry was a child, she struggled with reading. Feeling embarrassed and ashamed, she did her best to hide it. And she was pretty good at hiding it. As her family moved around a lot, due to her parents&apos; military career, she adapted and kept hiding it &#x2014; making it all the way through school without anyone really noticing. </p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div><p></p><p>After graduating from high school, she started looking for support to improve her reading skills. </p><p>&quot;I was turned away because I was over the age of 17, and other private options like one-on-one tutoring were financially out of reach for me.&quot; </p><p>Deidra promised that one day she&apos;d do something to fix it. After struggling for years, and eventually finding support, she started a nonprofit to help other adults facing their own challenges with literacy. Now she&apos;s striving to help the almost 43,000,000 adults who still are struggling. According to the <a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/story/How-Serious-Is-Americas-Literacy-Problem" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES)</a>, 21 percent of adults in the United States (about 43 million) fall into the illiterate/functionally illiterate category.</p><p>For Deidra, college was the first time she experienced and understood what functional illiteracy was. Someone who is illiterate is unable to read or write at all, but someone who is functionally illiterate has some reading skills &#x2014; they&apos;re just not strong enough to manage daily living and employment tasks. </p><p>She was able to graduate by taking extra summer semesters, spending long nights studying, changing her major when it got too hard, and getting help from her dad.</p><p>&quot;I was so proud that I actually made it through college and graduated,&quot; Deidra says. &quot;But once I started to apply for jobs, reality kicked in fast. I never truly fixed my literacy problems. Instead, I found ways to work around them in order to spare myself the embarrassment and shame that I already felt daily.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I relied heavily on movies to teach me and give me exposure to things in life that would help me relate to others,&quot; she says. &quot;This caused me to live a life of fear, limitations, and hopelessness.&quot; </p><p>&quot;I felt unworthy because I knew I had this big secret &#x2014; and thought if people knew, they would see that I had no value.&quot;</p><p>Deidra continued to live like this for years until she had a lightbulb moment. </p><p>&quot;I was working so hard to hide my literacy struggle in order to make it work, but I asked myself, &apos;What if I worked just as hard to fix it?&apos;&quot; </p><p>She found the courage to tell a friend, who began tutoring her. &quot;The hope, courage, and confidence she helped me find was the beautiful moment of empowerment that reminded me to create and provide a resource for people just like me.&quot;</p><p>That&apos;s exactly what she did. On March 12, 2020, she and another friend decided to start a nonprofit to help other adults that were functionally illiterate. And even though COVID-19 shut down businesses and sent people into lockdown the very next day, she didn&apos;t let it stop her. </p><p>&quot;I just believed God was with me and the time was still now because people have been waiting for this,&quot; she says. </p><p>She launched <a href="https://readingtonewheights.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Reading to New Heights</a>, an organization that teaches adults the fundamentals of reading with one-on-one, confidential and virtual tutoring sessions with certified educators. </p><figure><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yODAzMTk3Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3MjM4NDgwNn0.QwQp0PfEM7DfrG3MR4Gi3oXE5zRDinfAqkcrcfND2j4/img.jpg?width=1080&amp;coordinates=0%2C76%2C0%2C342&amp;height=1247"></figure><p>&quot;The curriculum that our educators teach from allows our adult learners to revisit the fundamentals of reading and comprehension as if they are learning them for the first time,&quot; Deidra says. &quot;Basic reading foundations such as phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, spelling, vocabulary and comprehension are exactly what adults struggling with illiteracy need in order to build competent literacy skills and fill the gaps that illiteracy causes in education.&quot;</p><p>And most importantly, these services are provided at no cost, so that anyone who needs them has access. </p><p>&quot;Though illiteracy and functional illiteracy can affect anyone, people in low-income and underserved communities of color are more likely to be limited in education, income, and workplace advancement opportunities because of it.&quot; </p><p>&quot;Illiteracy and functional illiteracy can be directly linked to higher prison populations, lower household incomes, and inaccessibility to quality healthcare,&quot; Deidra explains. &quot;By committing to developing the fundamentals of reading, our adult learners overcome both the psychological and environmental limitations of illiteracy.&quot;</p><p>Since they launched, the nonprofit has been featured on Fox 4 News, which gave them the exposure they needed to grow from three adult program participants to 20 &#x2014; and they hope to continue growing. They have also been accepted into an Incubator Program with the United Way, which is designed to support them while they build their business. </p><p>Deidra is one of Tory Burch&apos;s Empowered Women this year. The donation she receives as a nominee is being awarded to her new and growing nonprofit. </p><p>&quot;It&apos;s kind of ironic, the very thing I was ashamed of and thought I had to hide for years was the one thing that, once I shared it, not only freed me but gave me hope and provided a way to help others,&quot; Deidra says. &quot;I love that my story has been about helping others find the courage to share and take the first step to start their literacy journey.&quot;</p><p>To learn more about Tory Burch and Upworthy&apos;s Empowered Women program visit <a href="https://www.toryburch.com/empoweringwomen/empoweredwomen/" target="_blank">https://www.toryburch.com/empoweredwomen</a>.

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>In 1964, Paul McCartney of the Beatles famously sang, &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t care too much for money, money can&#x2019;t buy me love.&#x201D; While Mr. McCartney&#x2019;s sentiments were definitely a major foreshadowing of the hippie, free-love movement that was to come in the &#x2018;60s, it appears as though he was also onto a big truth that wouldn&#x2019;t be proven for another 50 years.<br></p><p>Seven years ago, researchers Hugo M. Mialon and Andrew Francis-Tan from Emory University embarked on the first study to determine whether spending a lot on a wedding or engagement ring meant a marriage would succeed or fail.</p><p>The pair wanted to see if the wedding industry was being honest when it came to claims that the more money a couple spends, the more likely they are to stay together.</p><p>&#x201C;The wedding industry has consistently sought to link wedding spending with long-lasting marriages.

The researchers determined that &quot;marriage duration is inversely associated with spending on the engagement ring and wedding ceremony.&quot;</p><p>Conversely, they found that &quot;relatively low spending on the wedding is positively associated with duration among male and female respondents.&quot;</p><p>The researchers also found that the number of people who attend the wedding matters, too. The questionnaire revealed that &#x201C;high wedding attendance and having a honeymoon (regardless of how much it cost) are generally positively associated with marriage duration.&quot;</p><p>The researchers haven&#x2019;t studied why people who splurge on weddings and rings have a greater chance of having to hire divorce lawyers, but they have a few theories.</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem3" data-id="3" data-reload-ads="true" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/research-shows-the-more-expensive-your-wedding-the-lower-the-chances-of-living-happily-ever-after?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" data-basename="particle-3" data-post-id="2655933025" data-published-at="1638834198" data-use-pagination="False"> <p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/WedLocks-hair-bride-wedlocks-iVhmiNybaX5TlI3dgU"></a></p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/research-shows-the-more-expensive-your-wedding-the-lower-the-chances-of-living-happily-ever-after?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2655933025" data-published-at="1638834198" data-use-pagination="False"> <p>&#x201C;It could be that the type of couples who have a &#x2026; (cheap wedding) are the type that are a perfect match for each other,&#x201D; <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/10/13/living/wedding-expenses-study/index.html" target="_blank">Mialon told CNN.</a> &#x201C;Or it could be that having an inexpensive wedding relieves young couples of financial burdens that may strain their marriage,&#x201D; he added.</p><p>Francis-Tan believes that people who have weddings with a large number of attendees are more successful because they have a lot of support.</p><p>&#x201C;This could be evidence of a community effect, i.e., having more support from friends and family may help the couple to get through the challenges of marriage,&#x201D; Francis-Tan said. &#x201C;Or this could be that the type of couples who have a lot of friends and family are also the type that tend not to divorce as much.&#x201D;</p><p>Could it also be that people who put a big emphasis on a flashy wedding and jewelry tend to bit a bit more materialistic?

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>Most of us spend our lives understanding that there is a certain order to nature. We have prey and we have predators, and some predators, like big cats in the wild, sit at the top of the chain, feared by all.</p><p>So when a big honking mountain lion, also known as a cougar or a puma, shows up on your property, it&apos;s normal to be concerned&#x2014;especially if you have pets that spend time outside. Most people would find themselves sweating a bit if a cougar showed up at their door, even with a thick pane of glass between them and the big kitty. Most animals would, too, if they understood the danger of what they were looking at.</p><p>But Dash the tiny doggo is not most animals. </p><p>Dash is delighting the masses with his reaction to a mountain lion that paid his house a visit in Colorado recently. In a video shared by Sarah Bole <a href="https://www.facebook.com/1144407062/posts/10226904318691025/?d=n" target="_blank">on Facebook</a> and then reshared on Twitter, Dash sits right up against the glass door, cool as a cucumber, as the cougar approaches. Even when the lion taps the glass with its formidable paw, Dash stands his ground, totally unfazed. While you can hear the panic in his human&apos;s voice, Dash just sits there wagging his tail. </p><hr><p><br></p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/tiny-dog-confronts-mountain-lion?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655932472" data-published-at="1638833514" data-use-pagination="False"> <div id="786bb" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="51c6557dfd5b0385ee2e2997e1678e73"> <div class="rm-embed-container rm-embed-twitter rm-loading"> <span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-mobile" style="padding-bottom: 182%"></span> <span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-desktop" style="padding-bottom: 147%"></span> <div class="rm-embed-holder"> <blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-custom-tweet" data-twitter-tweet-id="1467590226050568192" data-partner="rebelmouse"> <div style="margin:1em 0">&quot;I came home from work tonight and walked to see this on the patio.

And then the barking and growling that only came after the cougar walked away. Absolutely hilarious.</p><p>Dash is a friggin&apos; hero. His poor human was distraught, and Dash just exuded calm confidence that that cougar was not gonna get him. His human kept telling him to get back, and he was absolutely not having it.

If you can&apos;t beat a predator, confuse them to make them think you&apos;re not prey, right? </p><p>(Also, let&apos;s hope that owner had those door handles locked and considers changing to a round doorknob instead.

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>Dictionary.com has officially announced its 2021 word of the year, and that word is:</p><p><strong>Allyship</strong></p><p>Despite the plethora of divisive stories this year&#x2014;debates about vaccines, gun safety, education, abortion, the validity of conspiracy theories&#x2014;this word has prevailed in our collective consciousness. And that alone indicates something much more uplifting: What matters most to people is helping one another.<br></p><p>Stemming from &#x201C;alliance&#x201D; (meaning the &#x201C;merging of efforts or interests by persons, families, states or organizations,&#x201D; according to Dictionary.com) &#x201C;allyship&#x201D; had only been added to the platform a month before earning the 2021 title. And in this year alone, it was in the top 850 searches <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/06/word-of-the-year-2021-dictionary-allyship" target="_blank">out of thousands and thousands of words</a>, and its frequency of use has surged 700% since 2020. </p><p><br></p><hr><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/dictionary-word-of-year2021-allyship?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655932657" data-published-at="1638830341" data-use-pagination="False"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&#x1F4D8; The word allyship combines the noun ally, &#x201C;a person who advocates for or supports a marginalized or politicized group but is not a member of the group,&#x201D; and -ship, a suffix denoting &#x201C;status, condition.&#x201D; (2/11) <a href="https://t.co/xo8qd7d8ox">https://t.co/xo8qd7d8ox</a></p>&#x2014; Dictionary.com (@Dictionarycom) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dictionarycom/status/1467916871244693513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> <p>Dictionary.com gives two different definitions:<br></p><p><em>Allyship (noun)</em></p><p><em>1. advocates and actively works for the inclusion of a marginalized or politicized group in all areas of society but is not a member of that group, and acts in solidarity with its struggle and point of view and under its leadership.</em></p><p><em>2. the relationship of persons, groups or nations associating and cooperating with one another for a common cause or purpose.</em></p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/dictionary-word-of-year2021-allyship?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2655932657" data-published-at="1638830341" data-use-pagination="False"> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;Vaccine&quot; is Merriam-Webster&apos;s Word of the Year.

And with searing headlines of political discord, pessimistic outlooks on the pandemic and an overall dismal public view of humanity, &#x201C;allyship&#x201D; seems &#x2026; a less than optimal choice. Did they consider &#x201C;vaccine&#x201D; like <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/29/1059795123/merriam-webster-word-of-the-year-2021-vaccine#:~:text=Platt%2FGetty%20Images-,A%20person%20prepares%20to%20administer%20a%20Pfizer%20COVID%20vaccine%20at,a%20sustained%20surge%20in%20lookups." target="_blank">Merriam Webster</a> did? Or &#x201C;variant&#x201D;? How about &#x201C;Delta&#x201D;? Surely these options better reflect the times?</p><p>Associate Director of Content &amp; Education John Kelly noted, &#x201C;It might be a surprising choice for some,&#x201D; but &#x201C;in the past few decades, the term has evolved to take on a more nuanced and specific meaning. It is continuing to evolve and we saw that in many ways.&#x201D;</p><p>Allyship has now extended to frontline workers, teachers and parents who have gained support and advocacy during the pandemic. </p><p>&#x201C;This year, we saw a lot of businesses and organizations very prominently, publicly, beginning efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Allyship is tied to that. In the classroom, there is a flashpoint around the term &#x2018;critical race theory&#x2019;. Allyship connects with this as well,&#x201D; Kelly said.</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem3" data-id="3" data-reload-ads="true" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/dictionary-word-of-year2021-allyship?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" data-basename="particle-3" data-post-id="2655932657" data-published-at="1638830341" data-use-pagination="False"> <p><a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/word-of-the-year/" target="_blank">The site</a> also noted how a theme of genuine, nonperformative allyship was at the center of many &#x201C;defining new stories of 2021&#x201D; that made a lasting positive impact, from <a href="https://time.com/6086374/simone-biles-and-why-we-all-get-the-twisties-even-if-we-cant-fly/" target="_blank">Simone Biles</a> and the mental health of athletes to the <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/historical-current-events/great-resignation/" target="_blank">Great Resignation</a> and workplace burnout.</p><p>&#x201C;These events were notable not only in their own right, of course, but also because of the ways we largely reacted to and discussed them through the lens of who gets a voice, who deserves empathy, and who and what is valued. This was a lens of <em>allyship</em>,&#x201D; according to Dictionary.com.</p><p>When the world is looked at through this lens, perhaps the path toward 2022 is more compassionate and collaborative than our fears would indicate. And perhaps we can take a more elevated view of what it means to be an ally. At the end of the day, we could all use a little more friends and a little less enemies. </p> </div><p></p><div class="post-pager js-listicle-pager" data-listicle-style data-async_load_parameters="platform=desktop&amp;display_ads=1&amp;settings=%7B%22enter_url%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_post_section%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_breaks%22%3A+%5B2%5D%2C+%22prevent_last_break_repetition%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_numeration%22%3A+false%2C+%22show_columns_on_mobile%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_order%22%3A+%5B2%5D%2C+%22turn_into_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22list_breaks%22%3A+null%2C+%22reorder_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22cooldown_in_seconds%22%3A+null%2C+%22pagination_order%22%3A+%5B%5D%2C+%22source%22%3A+%22post_listicle_settings%22%2C+%22next_post_url%22%3A+null%2C+%22up_down_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22allow_url_change%22%3A+true%2C+%22numeration_sort%22%3A+-1%2C+%22allow_url_update%22%3A+true%2C+%22use_pagination%22%3A+false%2C+%22body_text_above%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_ads%22%3A+true%2C+%22items_as_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22multiple_answers%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_redirect%22%3A+false%2C+%22is_guest_voting_allowed%22%3A+true%2C+%22layout_type%22%3A+1%2C+%22voting_extra_fields%22%3A+%7B%7D%7D"> </div></div> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>There are pop stars, and then there are singers. While recording studio technology can make people sound like amazing singers, the proof is in their live performances. </p><p>Kelly Clarkson and Ariana Grande took it a whole step further on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,&quot; delivering not only a jaw-dropping live performance but doing so in the form of revolving pop diva hits in an &quot;impossible karaoke&quot; showdown. In less than five minutes, they showed off their combined ability to nail pretty much anything, from imitating iconic singers&apos; styles to belting out well-known songs with their own vocal stylings. </p><p>Watch this and try not to be impressed:</p><hr><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/kelly-clarkson-and-ariana-grande-jimmy-fallon?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655930660" data-published-at="1638823909" data-use-pagination="False"> <div id="41eec" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="2f9e3838fdad8a38db88148296f49b5c"> <div class="rm-embed-container rm-embed-twitter rm-loading"> <span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-mobile" style="padding-bottom: 137%"></span> <span class="rm-embed-spacer rm-embed-spacer-desktop" style="padding-bottom: 102%"></span> <div class="rm-embed-holder"> <blockquote class="rm-embed twitter-custom-tweet" data-twitter-tweet-id="1465697217876955148" data-partner="rebelmouse"> <div style="margin:1em 0">give kelly clarkson and ariana grande an exorbitantly expensive 10-episode Netflix series where they just hang out and sing dueling pop covers for an hourpic.twitter.com/m5IJAZ2DYL</div> &#x2014; alex (@alex) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_abads/statuses/1465697217876955148">1638284422</a> </blockquote> </div> </div> </div> <p>There&apos;s a reason Kelly Clarkson won the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot; and went on to become a multiplatinum recording artist. What&apos;s funny is seeing some people in the replies saying they didn&apos;t know she could sing like that. Yes. Yes she can. And she has since the beginning.</p><p>Check out this performance of Celine Dion&apos;s &quot;I Surrender&quot; during the first season of &quot;American Idol.&quot; At this point, she was an amateur singer and her vocal chords were stressed after weeks of rehearsing and competing, and she still knocked it out of the park. Simon Cowell and Randy Jackson both said they&apos;d put her in the same league as Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey and Celine Dion, and she&apos;s shown she deserves that classification over and over again since. </p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/kelly-clarkson-and-ariana-grande-jimmy-fallon?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2655930660" data-published-at="1638823909" data-use-pagination="False"> <span style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="a73f8036b2f72c740f7eeabacf25bfec"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/39CkiUvz1Io?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></span> <p>And Ariana Grande has made a name for herself for her ability to impersonate different singers while also sounding freaking amazing. Jimmy Fallon has had her on his show multiple times doing musical impressions. Check this one out from when she was just 21 years old. I mean, singing &quot;The Wheels on the Bus&quot; as Christina Aguilera? The woman can sing. Period.</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem3" data-id="3" data-reload-ads="true" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/kelly-clarkson-and-ariana-grande-jimmy-fallon?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" data-basename="particle-3" data-post-id="2655930660" data-published-at="1638823909" data-use-pagination="False"> <span style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="8d77f686ae2241cd737524c34adbfa5d"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ss9ygQqqL2Q?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></span> <p>So of course, having Kelly Clarkson and Ariana Grande singing together is a real treat. And they&apos;ve gifted us with a delicious duet for the holiday season with a live performance of &quot;Santa, Can&apos;t You Hear Me.&quot; Their voices complement one another so beautifully, with Grande&apos;s silvery sweetness and Clarkson&apos;s rich resonance. The amount of talent pouring forth from these ladies is simply unreal. </p><p>As Jimmy Fallon said, &quot;How?&quot; </p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem4" data-id="4" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/kelly-clarkson-and-ariana-grande-jimmy-fallon?rebelltitem=4#rebelltitem4" data-basename="particle-4" data-post-id="2655930660" data-published-at="1638823909" data-use-pagination="False"> <span style="display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;" class="rm-shortcode" data-rm-shortcode-id="f14220a9e2be829c6a9fb9fa512cc49b"><iframe type="lazy-iframe" data-runner-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ymU-S2oIFqY?rel=0" width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;"></iframe></span> </div><p></p><div class="post-pager js-listicle-pager" data-listicle-style data-async_load_parameters="platform=desktop&amp;display_ads=1&amp;settings=%7B%22enter_url%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_post_section%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_breaks%22%3A+%5B2%2C+2%5D%2C+%22prevent_last_break_repetition%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_numeration%22%3A+false%2C+%22show_columns_on_mobile%22%3A+false%2C+%22ads_order%22%3A+%5B2%5D%2C+%22turn_into_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22list_breaks%22%3A+null%2C+%22reorder_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22cooldown_in_seconds%22%3A+null%2C+%22pagination_order%22%3A+%5B%5D%2C+%22source%22%3A+%22post_listicle_settings%22%2C+%22next_post_url%22%3A+null%2C+%22up_down_voting%22%3A+false%2C+%22allow_url_change%22%3A+true%2C+%22numeration_sort%22%3A+-1%2C+%22allow_url_update%22%3A+true%2C+%22use_pagination%22%3A+false%2C+%22body_text_above%22%3A+false%2C+%22use_ads%22%3A+true%2C+%22items_as_posts%22%3A+false%2C+%22multiple_answers%22%3A+false%2C+%22no_redirect%22%3A+false%2C+%22is_guest_voting_allowed%22%3A+true%2C+%22layout_type%22%3A+1%2C+%22voting_extra_fields%22%3A+%7B%7D%7D"> </div></div> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <div class="body-description"><p>New law in Spain classifies animals as &#x2018;sentient beings&#x2019;</p> <p>At some point, every pet owner has wondered what their animals were thinking. If you&#x2019;ve ever stared into a dog or cat&#x2019;s eyes, you&#x2019;ve certainly seen a spectrum of emotions and thoughts reflected back to you: love, anger, trust, curiosity, playfulness and so on. Skeptics say attached animal owners are simply projecting human traits onto creatures that still exist purely on a primal level, free of the consciousness that supposedly makes human beings unique. </p> <p>But a new law in Spain challenges that assumption with real weight behind it, <a href="https://english.elpais.com/society/2021-12-03/spain-approves-new-law-recognizing-animals-as-sentient-beings.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">labeling all animals, including wild ones, as sentient beings</a>. </p> <p>According to El Pais: &#x201C;From now on, animals will be treated as &#x201C;sentient beings,&#x201D; and as such will have a different legal standing than an inanimate object. They will no longer be able to be seized, abandoned, mistreated or separated from one of their owners in the case of a divorce or separation, without having their wellbeing and protection taken into account.&#x201D;</p><hr> <p><br></p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem1" data-id="1" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/new-law-spain-classifies-animals-sentient-beings?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1" data-basename="particle-1" data-post-id="2655924957" data-published-at="1638760588" data-use-pagination="False"> <p>Support for the law gained momentum last month after a divorcing couple in Spain were granted joint custody of their border collie Panda after each argued in court for sole custody of the dog. The judge in the case described both owners as &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D; people who had cared for the dog and therefore the dog should not suffer from being separated from one of its owners in their divorce.</p><p>&#x201C;What is novel is to be able to use the convention to avoid having to define the pet as a shared thing or property and instead to focus on the animal&#x2019;s welfare, the emotional bond and the shared responsibility of taking care of an animal, beyond the pet being considered a property,&#x201D; Lola Garc&#xED;a, a lawyer specializing in animal welfare and who represented the plaintiff in the case, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/27/spain-dog-joint-custody-panda/" target="_blank">told the Washington Post.</a></p><p>In an approach remarkably similar to child custody arguments, Garc&#xED;a cited evidence such as shared vet bills, adoption contracts and even photos the couple took with Panda, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/27/spain-dog-joint-custody-panda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to the Post</a>. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s an emotional bond that the justice system needs to recognize,&#x201D; she told the paper.</p><p>One of Spain&#x2019;s congressional members who supported the bill called it a &#x201C;moral victory&#x201D; citing an estimated 200,000 pets that are abandoned in Spain each year.</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem3" data-id="3" data-reload-ads="false" data-is-image="True" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/new-law-spain-classifies-animals-sentient-beings?rebelltitem=3#rebelltitem3" data-basename="particle-3" data-post-id="2655924957" data-published-at="1638760588" data-use-pagination="False"> <figcaption></figcaption> <figcaption>Photo by Andrew S on Unsplash</figcaption> </div> <div class="rebellt-item col1" id="rebelltitem2" data-id="2" data-reload-ads="true" data-is-image="False" data-href="https://www.upworthy.com/new-law-spain-classifies-animals-sentient-beings?rebelltitem=2#rebelltitem2" data-basename="particle-2" data-post-id="2655924957" data-published-at="1638760588" data-use-pagination="False"> <p>Several European countries have similar animal sentient laws and similar regulations are seen as part of a larger trend sweeping the globe.

Plus all profits from the tune are dedicated to two charities: the Ed Sheeran Suffolk Music Foundation and the Elton John AIDS Foundation. </p>I personally don&#x2019;t know which is more of a highlight: Ed Sheeran channeling his inner-Mariah, performing a faux sexy dance in a leg revealing Santa outfit, or him flying through the air with a giant Frosty the Snowman &#x2026; who seems to be sporting glasses similar to Elton&#x2019;s.

In his post, he explains how he pulled over a black teen for texting while driving:</p><p></p><div id="upworthyFreeStarVideoAdContainer"><div id="freestar-video-parent"><div id="freestar-video-child"></div></div></div><p></p><hr><figure><img src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8xOTUxOTI2NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY3NzA4ODQxNH0.oyMtgSebp-Xx6ECMjAKPG_oP7rNxDA8G9HfoaMUOTos/img.jpg?width=980"></figure><p>&#x201C;I pulled a car over last night for texting and driving. When I went to talk to the driver, I found a young black male, who was looking at me like he was absolutely terrified with his hands up. He said, &apos;What do you want me to do officer?&apos; His voice was quivering. He was genuinely scared,&quot; McMillan wrote.</p><h2>But McMillan said he wasn&apos;t interested in harassing or arresting the young man, let alone inflicting violence upon him. Nonetheless, the teen&apos;s emotional response hit McMillan like a punch to the gut.</h2><p>&#x201C;I just looked at him for a moment, because what I was seeing made me sad. I said, &apos;I just don&apos;t want you to get hurt.&apos; In which he replied, with his voice still shaking, &apos;Do you want me to get out of the car.&apos; I said, &apos;No, I don&apos;t want you to text and drive. I don&apos;t want you to get in a wreck. I want your mom to always have her baby boy. I want you to grow up and be somebody. I don&apos;t even want to write you a ticket. Just please pay attention, and put the phone down. I just don&apos;t want you to get hurt,&apos;&quot; he wrote.</p><h2>McMillan said the interaction made him reflect on a deeply personal level about the national attention being paid to acts of police violence against black Americans, particularly young black men. </h2><p>&#x201C;I truly don&apos;t even care who&apos;s fault it is that young man was so scared to have a police officer at his window. Blame the media, blame bad cops, blame protestors, or Colin Kaepernick if you want. It doesn&apos;t matter to me who&apos;s to blame. I just wish somebody would fix it.&quot;</p><p><em><a href="https://www.good.is/articles/cop-pulls-over-black-teen-viral-post" target="_blank">This story originally appeared on GOOD.</a></em></p></div> ]]>

It&#x2019;s hard to watch this innocent child&#x2019;s self-esteem so devastated. </p><p>Luckily, mom knew exactly what to say to help her daughter remember her worth.

Was it non-disabled people? Was it disabled people? Or was it allies? Was it athletes? One of the things we&apos;ve been really considerate around is making sure that across these six episodes that we appeal to listen to amplify and bring questions to each of those audiences.&quot;</p><p>Morgan boiled the far-reaching effort down to one big takeaway. People with disabilities need greater representation in the places where decisions are being made.</p><p>&quot;I feel that the next part of this journey to take that giant leap forward, not slowly incremental changes, we need to see disabled people in decision-making roles,&quot; she said in episode 6.</p><p>&quot;We need to see disabled people across the board because then we don&apos;t need to present our argument for why you need to be represented or why you should be in the room,&quot; she added. &quot;Somebody will get it already.
