But aside from the <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-the-higgs-boson-particle-280" target="_blank">spectacular discovery</a> of the Higgs boson, the project has <a href="https://theconversation.com/could-the-higgs-nobel-be-the-end-of-particle-physics-18978" target="_blank">failed to</a> yield any clues as to what might lie beyond the <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-standard-model-of-particle-physics-2539" target="_blank">standard model of particle physics</a>, our current best theory of the micro-cosmos.</p><p>So our <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11769" target="_blank">new paper</a> from LHCb, <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-does-an-experiment-at-the-large-hadron-collider-work-42846" target="_blank">one of the four giant LHC experiments</a>, is likely to set physicists' hearts beating just a little faster. After analysing trillions of collisions produced over the last decade, we may be seeing evidence of something altogether new – potentially the carrier of a brand new force of nature.</p><p>But the excitement is tempered by extreme caution. The standard model has withstood every experimental test thrown at it since it was assembled in the 1970s, so to claim that we're finally seeing something it can't explain requires extraordinary evidence. </p><div class="listicle"> <div class="rebellt-item "> <h1 data-role="headline"></h1> <h2>Strange anomaly</h2><p>The standard model describes nature on the smallest of scales, comprising <a href="https://theconversation.com/explainer-what-are-fundamental-particles-38339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fundamental particles</a> known as leptons (such as electrons) and quarks (which can come together to form heavier particles such as protons and neutrons) and the forces they interact with.</p><p>There are many different kinds of quarks, some of which are unstable and can decay into other particles. The new result relates to an experimental anomaly that was <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.151601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first hinted at in 2014</a>, when LHCb physicists spotted "beauty" quarks decaying in unexpected ways.</p><p>Specifically, beauty quarks appeared to be decaying into leptons called "muons" less often than they decayed into electrons. This is strange because the muon is in essence a carbon-copy of the electron, identical in every way except that it's around 200 times heavier.</p><p>You would expect beauty quarks to decay into muons just as often as they do to electrons. The only way these decays could happen at different rates is if some never-before-seen particles were getting involved in the decay and tipping the scales against muons.</p><p>While the 2014 result was intriguing, it wasn't precise enough to draw a firm conclusion. Since then, a number of other anomalies have appeared in related processes. They have all individually been too subtle for researchers to be confident that they were genuine signs of new physics, but tantalisingly, they all seemed to be pointing in a similar direction.</p><p>The big question was whether these anomalies would get stronger as more data was analysed or melt away into nothing. In 2019, LHCb performed the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.122.191801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same measurement</a> of beauty quark decay again but with extra data taken in 2015 and 2016. But things weren't much clearer than they'd been five years earlier.</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item "> <h1 data-role="headline"></h1> <h2>New results</h2><p>Today's result doubles the existing dataset by adding the sample recorded in 2017 and 2018. To avoid accidentally introducing biases, the data was analysed "blind" – the scientists couldn't see the result until all the procedures used in the measurement had been tested and reviewed.</p><p><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/mitesh.patel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitesh Patel</a>, a particle physicist at Imperial College London and one of the leaders of the experiment, described the excitement he felt when the moment came to look at the result. "I was actually shaking", he said, "I realised this was probably the most exciting thing I've done in my 20 years in particle physics."</p><p>When the result came up on the screen, the anomaly was still there – around 85 muon decays for every 100 electron decays, but with a smaller uncertainty than before.</p><p>What will excite many physicists is that the uncertainty of the result is now over "three sigma" – scientists' way of saying that there is only around a one in a thousand chance that the result is a random fluke of the data. Conventionally, particle physicists call anything over three sigma "evidence". However, we are still a long way from a confirmed "discovery" or "observation" – that would require five sigma.</p><p>Theorists have shown it is possible to explain this anomaly (and others) by recognising the existence of brand new particles that are influencing the ways in which the quarks decays. One possibility is a fundamental particle called a "Z prime" – in essence a carrier of a brand new force of nature. This force would be extremely weak, which is why we haven't seen any signs of it until now, and would interact with electrons and muons differently.</p><p>Another option is the hypothetical "<a href="https://home.cern/news/news/physics/hunt-leptoquarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leptoquark</a>" – a particle that has the unique ability to decay to quarks and leptons simultaneously and could be part of a larger puzzle that explains why we see the particles that we do in nature.</p> </div> <div class="rebellt-item "> <h1 data-role="headline"></h1> <h2>Interpreting the findings</h2><p>So have we finally seen evidence of new physics? Well, maybe, maybe not. We do a lot of measurements at the LHC, so you might expect at least some of them to fall this far from the standard model. And we can never totally discount the possibility that there's some bias in our experiment that we haven't properly accounted for, even though this result has been checked extraordinarily thoroughly. Ultimately, the picture will only become clearer with more data. LHCb is currently undergoing a major upgrade to dramatically increase the rate it can record collisions.</p><p>Even if the anomaly persists, it will probably only be fully accepted once an independent experiment confirms the results. One exciting possibility is that we might be able to detect the new particles responsible for the effect being created directly in the collisions at the LHC. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.belle2.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belle II experiment</a> in Japan should be able to make similar measurements.</p><p>What then, could this mean for the future of fundamental physics? If what we are seeing is really the harbinger of some new fundamental particles then it will finally be the breakthrough that physicists have been yearning for for decades.</p><p>We will have finally seen a part of the larger picture that lies beyond the standard model, which ultimately could allow us to unravel any number of established mysteries. These include the nature of the invisible dark matter that fills the universe, or the nature of the Higgs boson. It could even help theorists unify the fundamental particles and forces. Or, perhaps best of all, it could be pointing at something we have never even considered.</p><p>So, should we be excited? Yes, results like this don't come around very often, the hunt is definitely on. But we should be cautious and humble too; extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Only time and hard work will tell if we have finally seen the first glimmer of what lies beyond our current understanding of particle physics.<img src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/157464/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation"></p><p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/harry-cliff-103546" target="_blank">Harry Cliff</a>, Particle physicist, <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-cambridge-1283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Cambridge</a></em>; <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/konstantinos-alexandros-petridis-1219851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Konstantinos Alexandros Petridis</a>, Senior lecturer in Particle Physics, <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-bristol-1211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Bristol</a></em>, and <a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/paula-alvarez-cartelle-1219212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paula Alvarez Cartelle</a>, Lecturer of Particle Physics, <em><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-cambridge-1283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">University of Cambridge</a></em></p><p>This article is republished from <a href="https://theconversation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

They grow as coffee "cherries," skin and pulp inside of which resides the precious beans. Before coffee beans can be fermented in water <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/about-coffee/10-steps-from-seed-to-cup" target="_blank"> as many are</a>, the cherries pass through a machine that extracts the bean from the skin and pulp. Miraculous as coffee beans are, new research suggests that their typically discarded pulp is even more amazing. It can restore tropical forests. </p><p> Researchers from ETH-Zurich and the University of Hawaii have found that this waste from coffee manufacturing is a fantastic growing agent after testing it out on some agriculturally depleted land in Costa Rica. </p><p> "The results were dramatic," reports lead author of the study Rebecca Cole. "The area treated with a thick layer of coffee pulp turned into a small forest in only two years while the control plot remained dominated by non-native pasture grasses." </p><h2>Pulp non-fiction</h2><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img class="rm-shortcode" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk5MDAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NTc3MzY4Nn0.367KNSR1eJ7-Kc7rSSTs2XtULSZ7gCPudgP3Lggcs38/img.jpg?width=980" id="61c15" data-rm-shortcode-id="559d96b3e72161a10bc3ccd04e434f81" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" /> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Coffee pulp arrives</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Credit: Rebecca Cole/<a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/forests-on-caffeine-coffee-waste-can-boost-forest-recovery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">British Ecological Society</a></small> </p><p> <br/> </p><p> The researchers delivered 30 dump trucks full of coffee pulp to a 35- by 40-meter parcel on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reserva.sabalito/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Reserva Biológica Sabalito</a> in Costa Rica's Coto Brus county. The land, previously part of a coffee plantation, is in the process of being reforested. </p><p> Starting in the 1950s, Costa Rica experienced rapid deforestation followed by coffee-growing and farming that resulted in a 25% loss of its natural forest cover by 2014. </p><p> Before spreading out the coffee pulp into a half-meter-thick layer for their test, the researchers measured the nutrients in the soil. They also catalogued the species living nearby, and made note of the size of woody stems present. The amount of forest ground cover was recorded, and drones were sent aloft to capture the amount of canopy cover. </p><h2>Reforestation in the blink of an eye</h2><p><br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img class="rm-shortcode" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk5MDA4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTg4NzU2OH0.w-HS0Eh602m59eFDHPfy7Radc0YhSkrroJGCfe50gSk/img.jpg?width=980" id="f78b2" data-rm-shortcode-id="ce9e76564a71084c7065f5b2b59ecf77" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" /> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">(A) Coffee pulp layer; (B) control area after two years; (C) coffee pulp area after two years; (D) overhead view of canopy in control area, above the red line, and the coffee-pulp area, below the red line</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Credits: A, B, and C: R.

In contrast, 80% of the coffee-pulp section was canopied by trees, and these trees were four times the height of those in the control parcel. </p><p> The researchers analyzed the nutrients available in the soil and found significantly elevated levels of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous, all vital agricultural nutrients. Curiously, potassium, also important for growth, was lower in the coffee-pulp area than in the control section. </p><p> The researchers also found that the coffee pulp eliminated invasive pasture grasses that inhibit reforestation. Their removal facilitated the reemergence of tree species whose seeds were introduced by wind or animal dispersal. </p><h2>A much-needed growth agent</h2><p> According to Cole, "This case study suggests that agricultural by-products can be used to speed up forest recovery on degraded tropical lands. In situations where processing these by-products incurs a cost to agricultural industries, using them for restoration to meet global reforestation objectives can represent a 'win-win' scenario." </p><p> Promising as coffee pulp may be, Cole cautions: "This study was done at only one large site, so more testing is needed to see if this strategy works across a broader range of conditions. The measurements we share are only from the first two years. Longer-term monitoring would show how the coffee pulp affected soil and vegetation over time. Additional testing can also assess whether there are any undesirable effects from the coffee pulp application." </p><p> In addition, she notes, the experiment only documents the value of coffee pulp on flat land when delivery of the substance by truck is fairly simple. "We would like," Cole says, "to scale up the study by testing this method across a variety of degraded sites in the landscape." </p><p> Just as exciting is the possibility that other such agricultural waste products may be good for reforesting depleted areas. Cole mentions orange husks as a material worthy of investigation. </p><p> "We hope," Cole concludes, "our study is a jumping off point for other researchers and industries to take a look at how they might make their production more efficient by creating links to the global restoration movement." </p><div> </div> ]]>

The comet, which was first<a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/eccentric-comet-outside-solar-system-discovered" target="_self"> spotted in 2019</a> by the amateur Ukrainian astronomer Gennady Borisov, likely never flew too close to any star including our sun, which left its composition very similar to how it was upon formation.</p><p>Comets, which are space bodies made of frozen gas, rock, and ice, are usually impacted by the heat and radiation they encounter on their way. What's attractive to scientists in studying comets that haven't changed much in their lifetimes is that they have a similar composition to the gas and dust that was present at the formation of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. Analyzing pristine comets can lead to a deeper understanding of the Solar System's beginnings and evolution. </p><p>The 2I/Borisov comet is only the second interstellar object ever found in our Solar System.

This helped the team compare 2I/Borisov to other local comets. The properties of the new comet were quite different from others they found in the Solar System, except for Hale-Bopp, a comet discovered in 1995 which is also considered very pristine.</p><p>The study's co-author Alberto Cellino from the Astrophysical Observatory of Torino, Italy, commented upon this connection, arrived at by analyzing polarization along with the comet's color: </p><p>"The fact that the two comets are remarkably similar suggests that the environment in which 2I/Borisov originated is not so different in composition from the environment in the early Solar System.".</p><p>In a fascinating nod to just how powerful Earth's top telescopes have become, another set of ESO researchers published a different study in<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso2106/eso2106b.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Nature Astronomy</a> on the comet's composition using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This team, led by astronomer Bin Yang, was able to gather many clues about 2I/Borisov's makeup from its <em>coma</em> – the envelope of dust surrounding it. Inside the coma, they discovered compact pebbles, grains around one millimeter in size. They could also tell that the relative amounts of carbon monoxide and water in the comet changed significantly as it came closer to the Sun. </p><p>This indicated to them that the materials in the comet came from different places in the cosmos. Matter in the comet's home star system was likely mixed in a discernible pattern that related to how far the comet was from its star, found the scientists. This was possibly affected by the presence of giant planets, which stirred up materials in their system through strong gravity. Astronomers think this kind of process also took place in the early period of the Solar System's life. </p><p>"Imagine how lucky we were that a comet from a system light-years away simply took a trip to our doorstep by chance," <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2106/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remarked</a> Yang.</p><p>In 2029, the European Space Agency plans to launch the Comet Interceptor project that would allow scientists to study comets that speed through our Solar System with even greater precision.</p> ]]>

All evolved the relatively rare ability to produce venom — chemical toxins that kill or incapacitate other animals through bites or stings. And in a few thousands years, there's a chance that scientists will add mice to that list.</p><p>That's one of the takeaways of a new study that explored the evolutionary origins of oral venom systems in animals, which have until now remained little understood.</p><p>"Oral venom systems evolved multiple times in numerous vertebrates enabling the exploitation of unique predatory niches," the researchers noted. "Yet how and when they evolved remains poorly understood. Up to now, most research on venom evolution has focused strictly on the toxins."</p><p>In the new study, published in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2021311118#sec-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>PNAS</em></a>, researchers instead focused on the gene-regulating networks associated with the production of venom in snakes. Because venom is a complex mixture of proteins, venom-producing animals have evolved a molecular system that's capable of properly folding chains of amino acids in a highly specific way. Without this, animals wouldn't be able to withstand the cellular stress caused by producing venom.</p><p>To better understand this process, the researchers examined venom glands of the Taiwan habu <a href="https://phys.org/tags/snake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snak</a>e, a pit viper endemic to Asia. The goal was to identify genes that are strongly coexpressed with venom. The researchers identified 3,000 "housekeeping genes" (i.e., genes that are always turned "on") that are associated with venom production, but primarily involved with protein folding and modification. They dubbed these nontoxic genes the "metavenom network."</p><p>After identifying the metavenom network in snakes, the researchers searched for similar networks within the genomes of other animals: mice, dogs, and humans. The results showed that these animals also possess key structures of the metavenom network that's found in snakes, suggesting mammals and snakes share a "common [gene] regulatory core" that traces back hundreds of millions of years to the species' common ancestor.</p><p>The key phenotypic difference is that snakes use this shared regulatory core to produce venom, while most other animals use it to produce saliva.</p><p>"[T]his is the first real solid evidence for the theory that venom glands evolved from early salivary glands," lead study author Agneesh Barua, a Ph.D. student at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), said in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/oios-amb032421.php#:~:text=Startling%20new%20evidence%20shows%20mammal,share%20a%20common%20genetic%20foundation.&text=Reporting%20this%20week%20in%20PNAS,in%20both%20reptiles%20and%20mammals." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. "And while snakes then went crazy, incorporating many different toxins into their venom and increasing the number of genes involved in producing venom, mammals like shrews produce simpler venom that has a high similarity to saliva."</p><p>So, given that mammals and snakes share more evolutionary mechanisms than previously thought, could animals like mice someday evolve the ability to produce venom? Barua said it's possible.</p><p>"There were experiments in the 1980s that showed that male mice produce compounds in their saliva that are highly toxic when injected into rats," Barua said in the press release. "If under certain ecological conditions, mice that produce more toxic proteins in their saliva have better reproductive success, then in a few thousand years, we might encounter venomous mice."</p><p>Overall, the study blurs "the line between venomous animals and their ancestors," and highlights the fundamental similarities between animals that look and behave very differently upon first glance.</p><hr><ul></ul><ul></ul> ]]>
