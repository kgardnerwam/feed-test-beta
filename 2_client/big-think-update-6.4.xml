Variations of it date back to Plato and Confucius, and the area is currently enjoying a tremendous amount of attention as thinkers from a variety of fields, including philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, consider the different aspects that go into making moral judgments.</p><p>But what is a moral judgment? Is there only one kind of judgment, or do we use different kinds in different situations? Are they all the same at the cognitive level?</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-psych-072220-104358" target="_blank">article</a> by <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/cognitive-linguistic-psychological-sciences/people/faculty/bertram-f-malle" target="_blank"><u>Dr. Bertram F. Malle</u></a> of Brown University offers a framework for understanding how people make moral judgments and what factors go into those judgments.</p><h2>You are judgmental</h2><p>The first type of judgment is dubbed "<strong>evaluations</strong>." These are the simple evaluations we make of things being good, bad, positive, or negative. We do this for just about everything, including in non-moral situations like when evaluating writing, and our brains are very good at doing it quickly. Some studies suggest that our brains begin to evaluate for goodness or badness within half a second of getting the information. This first pass doesn't have all the data the other kinds of judgments do, but it helps set the stage for more complicated moral judgments.</p><p>The second type is "<strong>norm judgments</strong>." This expansive category involves deciding if some action or thing is allowed, permissible, taboo, or otherwise acceptable. This determination is related to, but not dependent on, how we evaluate something. While evaluations can be done on any thing or action, norm judgments are limited to actions and often to future ones. Less reactive than the other judgments, this one can be applied before any action is taken and is often used to help determine what should be done before anything happens. Often invoking abstract notions of virtue and value, this category can be a bit more deliberative than the others. </p><p>The third kind is "<strong>wrongness judgments</strong>." These combine elements of the previous two to identify intentional violations of norms that are considered egregious. Our brains can do this fairly accurately in less than half a second. In experiments asking test subjects to identify actions as morally wrong or neutral, the accuracy rate neared 90% when given a little more time to do it. </p><p>While they are similar, a wrongness judgment is not the same as a norm judgment. Studies asking people to rank actions in terms of permissibility and wrongness find that people will often consider an action to be both wrong and permissible, such as pulling a lever to save five people at the cost of another person's life in the classic trolley problem. </p><p>Likewise, these judgments differ from evaluations in that wrongness is an entirely moral trait. While we might evaluate a "dad joke" as "bad," we likely won't consider it "wrong" unless it's sexist, racist, or otherwise egregious.</p><p>Last is "<strong>blame judgment</strong>." If wrongness judgments combine evaluations and norm judgments in a new way, then blame judgments combine all three. This is the most complex of the judgment categories. It includes factors of intentionality and justification -- most people blame somebody for accidentally spilling milk less than they'd blame them for intentionally pouring a gallon on the floor.</p><p>Like the other reactive judgments, this one is carried out quickly. Our brains start to place blame in less than two seconds. Blame is not only a social tool; it can help us understand who did what but can also help us regulate our moral behavior in the future.</p><h2>What use does this have? Can I use this to understand my behavior?</h2><p>Perhaps most striking is how quickly our brains process moral information. Within less than two seconds of seeing an action with a moral dimension to it, your brain has already made a basic judgment on if it was good or bad, morally wrong or not, and who to blame for it. Importantly, some of these quick decisions will be erroneous because they rely on preexisting biases and limited information.</p><p>The four-category framework can also help us understand that every moral situation can be considered from various angles and that holding beliefs on a single issue that are contradictory is entirely natural.</p><p>Something can be "bad" and "wrong," like letting a person die by being hit by a trolley car, and also "permissible," since the alternative in most trolley considerations is to let five other people get hit. The person who pulls the lever in the trolley problem might be "blameworthy" in this case, but not in the same way as a person who pushes a man on the tracks to stop the trolley.</p> ]]>

They grow as coffee "cherries," skin and pulp inside of which resides the precious beans. Before coffee beans can be fermented in water <a href="https://www.ncausa.org/about-coffee/10-steps-from-seed-to-cup" target="_blank"> as many are</a>, the cherries pass through a machine that extracts the bean from the skin and pulp. Miraculous as coffee beans are, new research suggests that their typically discarded pulp is even more amazing. It can restore tropical forests. </p><p> Researchers from ETH-Zurich and the University of Hawaii have found that this waste from coffee manufacturing is a fantastic growing agent after testing it out on some agriculturally depleted land in Costa Rica. </p><p> "The results were dramatic," reports lead author of the study Rebecca Cole. "The area treated with a thick layer of coffee pulp turned into a small forest in only two years while the control plot remained dominated by non-native pasture grasses." </p><h2>Pulp non-fiction</h2><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img class="rm-shortcode" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk5MDAyOC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1NTc3MzY4Nn0.367KNSR1eJ7-Kc7rSSTs2XtULSZ7gCPudgP3Lggcs38/img.jpg?width=980" id="61c15" data-rm-shortcode-id="559d96b3e72161a10bc3ccd04e434f81" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" /> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">Coffee pulp arrives</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Credit: Rebecca Cole/<a href="https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/forests-on-caffeine-coffee-waste-can-boost-forest-recovery/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">British Ecological Society</a></small> </p><p> <br/> </p><p> The researchers delivered 30 dump trucks full of coffee pulp to a 35- by 40-meter parcel on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/reserva.sabalito/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Reserva Biológica Sabalito</a> in Costa Rica's Coto Brus county. The land, previously part of a coffee plantation, is in the process of being reforested. </p><p> Starting in the 1950s, Costa Rica experienced rapid deforestation followed by coffee-growing and farming that resulted in a 25% loss of its natural forest cover by 2014. </p><p> Before spreading out the coffee pulp into a half-meter-thick layer for their test, the researchers measured the nutrients in the soil. They also catalogued the species living nearby, and made note of the size of woody stems present. The amount of forest ground cover was recorded, and drones were sent aloft to capture the amount of canopy cover. </p><h2>Reforestation in the blink of an eye</h2><p><br/></p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img class="rm-shortcode" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNTk5MDA4OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MTg4NzU2OH0.w-HS0Eh602m59eFDHPfy7Radc0YhSkrroJGCfe50gSk/img.jpg?width=980" id="f78b2" data-rm-shortcode-id="ce9e76564a71084c7065f5b2b59ecf77" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" /> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">(A) Coffee pulp layer; (B) control area after two years; (C) coffee pulp area after two years; (D) overhead view of canopy in control area, above the red line, and the coffee-pulp area, below the red line</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Credits: A, B, and C: R.

In contrast, 80% of the coffee-pulp section was canopied by trees, and these trees were four times the height of those in the control parcel. </p><p> The researchers analyzed the nutrients available in the soil and found significantly elevated levels of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous, all vital agricultural nutrients. Curiously, potassium, also important for growth, was lower in the coffee-pulp area than in the control section. </p><p> The researchers also found that the coffee pulp eliminated invasive pasture grasses that inhibit reforestation. Their removal facilitated the reemergence of tree species whose seeds were introduced by wind or animal dispersal. </p><h2>A much-needed growth agent</h2><p> According to Cole, "This case study suggests that agricultural by-products can be used to speed up forest recovery on degraded tropical lands. In situations where processing these by-products incurs a cost to agricultural industries, using them for restoration to meet global reforestation objectives can represent a 'win-win' scenario." </p><p> Promising as coffee pulp may be, Cole cautions: "This study was done at only one large site, so more testing is needed to see if this strategy works across a broader range of conditions. The measurements we share are only from the first two years. Longer-term monitoring would show how the coffee pulp affected soil and vegetation over time. Additional testing can also assess whether there are any undesirable effects from the coffee pulp application." </p><p> In addition, she notes, the experiment only documents the value of coffee pulp on flat land when delivery of the substance by truck is fairly simple. "We would like," Cole says, "to scale up the study by testing this method across a variety of degraded sites in the landscape." </p><p> Just as exciting is the possibility that other such agricultural waste products may be good for reforesting depleted areas. Cole mentions orange husks as a material worthy of investigation. </p><p> "We hope," Cole concludes, "our study is a jumping off point for other researchers and industries to take a look at how they might make their production more efficient by creating links to the global restoration movement." </p><div> </div> ]]>

The comet, which was first<a href="https://bigthink.com/surprising-science/eccentric-comet-outside-solar-system-discovered" target="_self"> spotted in 2019</a> by the amateur Ukrainian astronomer Gennady Borisov, likely never flew too close to any star including our sun, which left its composition very similar to how it was upon formation.</p><p>Comets, which are space bodies made of frozen gas, rock, and ice, are usually impacted by the heat and radiation they encounter on their way. What's attractive to scientists in studying comets that haven't changed much in their lifetimes is that they have a similar composition to the gas and dust that was present at the formation of the Solar System 4.5 billion years ago. Analyzing pristine comets can lead to a deeper understanding of the Solar System's beginnings and evolution. </p><p>The 2I/Borisov comet is only the second interstellar object ever found in our Solar System. The first one was 1I/'Oumuamua, detected in 2017.</p><p>The new study, based on observations from the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope (ESO's VLT) in Chile, was led by Stefano Bagnulo of the Armagh Observatory and Planetarium in Northern Ireland.</p><p>"2I/Borisov could represent the first truly pristine comet ever observed," said Bagnulo.</p><p class="shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image"> <img class="rm-shortcode" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNjAxNTU3NC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTY1MjY5NjQzNH0.0mVsibVMcWpk2cmN__5m0v-Jn-e6P_q-NWDsVZXla64/img.jpg?width=980" id="328cf" data-rm-shortcode-id="00530e2d7966a6d5963246fa259685fe" data-rm-shortcode-name="rebelmouse-image" /> <small class="image-media media-caption" placeholder="Add Photo Caption...">The 2I/Borisov interstellar comet captured with the VLT.</small><small class="image-media media-photo-credit" placeholder="Add Photo Credit...">Credit:ESO/O.

This helped the team compare 2I/Borisov to other local comets. The properties of the new comet were quite different from others they found in the Solar System, except for Hale-Bopp, a comet discovered in 1995 which is also considered very pristine.</p><p>The study's co-author Alberto Cellino from the Astrophysical Observatory of Torino, Italy, commented upon this connection, arrived at by analyzing polarization along with the comet's color: </p><p>"The fact that the two comets are remarkably similar suggests that the environment in which 2I/Borisov originated is not so different in composition from the environment in the early Solar System.".</p><p>In a fascinating nod to just how powerful Earth's top telescopes have become, another set of ESO researchers published a different study in<a href="https://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso2106/eso2106b.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Nature Astronomy</a> on the comet's composition using data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This team, led by astronomer Bin Yang, was able to gather many clues about 2I/Borisov's makeup from its <em>coma</em> – the envelope of dust surrounding it. Inside the coma, they discovered compact pebbles, grains around one millimeter in size. They could also tell that the relative amounts of carbon monoxide and water in the comet changed significantly as it came closer to the Sun. </p><p>This indicated to them that the materials in the comet came from different places in the cosmos. Matter in the comet's home star system was likely mixed in a discernible pattern that related to how far the comet was from its star, found the scientists. This was possibly affected by the presence of giant planets, which stirred up materials in their system through strong gravity. Astronomers think this kind of process also took place in the early period of the Solar System's life. </p><p>"Imagine how lucky we were that a comet from a system light-years away simply took a trip to our doorstep by chance," <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso2106/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">remarked</a> Yang.</p><p>In 2029, the European Space Agency plans to launch the Comet Interceptor project that would allow scientists to study comets that speed through our Solar System with even greater precision.</p> ]]>

All evolved the relatively rare ability to produce venom — chemical toxins that kill or incapacitate other animals through bites or stings. And in a few thousands years, there's a chance that scientists will add mice to that list.</p><p>That's one of the takeaways of a new study that explored the evolutionary origins of oral venom systems in animals, which have until now remained little understood.</p><p>"Oral venom systems evolved multiple times in numerous vertebrates enabling the exploitation of unique predatory niches," the researchers noted. "Yet how and when they evolved remains poorly understood. Up to now, most research on venom evolution has focused strictly on the toxins."</p><p>In the new study, published in the journal <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/14/e2021311118#sec-12" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><em>PNAS</em></a>, researchers instead focused on the gene-regulating networks associated with the production of venom in snakes. Because venom is a complex mixture of proteins, venom-producing animals have evolved a molecular system that's capable of properly folding chains of amino acids in a highly specific way. Without this, animals wouldn't be able to withstand the cellular stress caused by producing venom.</p><p>To better understand this process, the researchers examined venom glands of the Taiwan habu <a href="https://phys.org/tags/snake/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">snak</a>e, a pit viper endemic to Asia. The goal was to identify genes that are strongly coexpressed with venom. The researchers identified 3,000 "housekeeping genes" (i.e., genes that are always turned "on") that are associated with venom production, but primarily involved with protein folding and modification. They dubbed these nontoxic genes the "metavenom network."</p><p>After identifying the metavenom network in snakes, the researchers searched for similar networks within the genomes of other animals: mice, dogs, and humans. The results showed that these animals also possess key structures of the metavenom network that's found in snakes, suggesting mammals and snakes share a "common [gene] regulatory core" that traces back hundreds of millions of years to the species' common ancestor.</p><p>The key phenotypic difference is that snakes use this shared regulatory core to produce venom, while most other animals use it to produce saliva.</p><p>"[T]his is the first real solid evidence for the theory that venom glands evolved from early salivary glands," lead study author Agneesh Barua, a Ph.D. student at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University (OIST), said in a <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2021-03/oios-amb032421.php#:~:text=Startling%20new%20evidence%20shows%20mammal,share%20a%20common%20genetic%20foundation.&text=Reporting%20this%20week%20in%20PNAS,in%20both%20reptiles%20and%20mammals." rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">press release</a>. "And while snakes then went crazy, incorporating many different toxins into their venom and increasing the number of genes involved in producing venom, mammals like shrews produce simpler venom that has a high similarity to saliva."</p><p>So, given that mammals and snakes share more evolutionary mechanisms than previously thought, could animals like mice someday evolve the ability to produce venom? Barua said it's possible.</p><p>"There were experiments in the 1980s that showed that male mice produce compounds in their saliva that are highly toxic when injected into rats," Barua said in the press release. "If under certain ecological conditions, mice that produce more toxic proteins in their saliva have better reproductive success, then in a few thousand years, we might encounter venomous mice."</p><p>Overall, the study blurs "the line between venomous animals and their ancestors," and highlights the fundamental similarities between animals that look and behave very differently upon first glance.</p><hr><ul></ul><ul></ul> ]]>
