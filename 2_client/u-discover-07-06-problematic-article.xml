		<p>&#x201C;Just met the Beatles,&#x201D; he wrote under the black and white photograph, which showed him hugging the sisters in a friendly moment.</p><p>Back in May, <strong><a href="https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/drake-no-1-debuts-billboard-hot-100/">Drake&#xA0;broke his tie</a></strong> with Ariana Grande and BTS to be crowned the artist with the most No.1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart debuts.</p><p>Until his latest hit with Future, &#x201C;Wait for U&#x201D;, stormed to the top of the US chart, the superstar rapper was in joint place with the pop megastar and K-Pop boy band.</p><p>However, he now has six No.1 Hot 100 debuts to his name, with &#x201C;Wait for U&#x201D; joining &#x201C;God&#x2019;s Plan&#x201D;, &#x201C;Nice for What&#x201D;, &#x201C;Toosie Slide&#x201D;, &#x201C;What&#x2019;s Next&#x201D; and &#x201C;Way 2 Sexy&#x201D;.
