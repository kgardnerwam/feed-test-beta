        <![CDATA[<p>When a strong <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/627096/earthquake-facts">earthquake</a> triggered Mount St. Helens’s colossal <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/68512/15-explosive-facts-about-volcanoes">volcanic explosion</a> on May 18, 1980, the blast obliterated every object within a six-mile radius. It remains the United States’s <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-was-most-destructive-volcanic-eruption-history-united-states" target="_blank">most powerful</a>, and the world’s fifth most destructive, volcanic event in recent history. Here are more facts to mark the anniversary of the Mount St. Helens eruption. </p><h2>1. Mount St. Helens is part of the Pacific Ring of Fire.</h2><p>Mount St. Helens is part of the chain of 160 active volcanoes around the Pacific Rim known as the Ring of Fire. It sits on top of the<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/explosives-reveal-mount-st-helens-cold-heart" target="_blank"> subduction zone</a> where the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate slips under the North American plate. It’s a <a href="https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/stratovolcanoes" target="_blank">stratovolcano</a>, also known as a composite volcano: a steep-sided volcano with a cone made up of layers of lava, ash, and debris. Stratovolcanoes are considered <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/546207/how-dangerous-are-northwests-volcanoes">more dangerous</a> than shield volcanoes, which are created by slow lava flows and feature more gentle slopes. (The Hawaiian islands are a chain of shield volcanoes.) Stratovolcanoes tend to erupt explosively, and their steep sides are prone to landslides, avalanches, and sometimes even collapse.</p><h2>2. Mount St. Helens was named for a British diplomat.</h2>

		<p>Mount St. Helens isn’t named after a saint—it was named by George Vancouver, the British naval explorer who charted the Pacific Northwest in the 1790s, for his friend, <a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp03945/alleyne-fitzherbert-baron-st-helens" target="_blank">Baron St Helens</a>. The baron, whose given name was <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Fitzherbert,_Alleyne_(DNB00)" target="_blank">Alleyne Fitzherbert</a>, served as a diplomat for the British government in Brussels, Paris, Russia, Spain, and elsewhere. Among some of the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, the volcano is known as <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/what-origin-name-mount-st-helens?qt-news_science_products=0#qt-news_science_products" target="_blank"><em>Louwala-Clough</em></a> (Smoking Mountain), <em>Lawetlat’la</em> (Smoker), and <em>Nsh&#39; Ak&#39;w</em> (Water Coming Out).</p><h2>3. Mount St. Helens has been erupting for a long, long time.</h2><p>Mount St. Helens has gone through a number of eruptive stages over its lifetime, beginning 275,000 years ago. That’s relatively young for a volcano—a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220403061231/http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_formation.html" target="_blank">number of volcanoes</a> formed by the Hawaiian hot spot are tens of millions of years old. However, volcanoes change drastically over their lifetimes: Most of the modern Mount St. Helens cone that is visible now formed during the last 3000 years, according to the <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/" target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey</a>.</p><h2>4. Mount St. Helens is the most active volcano in the Cascade Range.</h2><p>Mount Baker, Mount Shasta, Mount Rainier, Mount Hood, Glacier Peak, and Lassen Peak are also <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/faq.html" target="_blank">active volcanoes</a> in the Cascades, but the most recent activity among them was at Lassen Peak in the early 1900s. Mount St. Helens is the <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/Historical/LewisClark/Info/summary_mount_st_helens.shtml" target="_blank">youngest</a> among the Cascade volcanoes, too, which is why it shows fewer signs of erosion than neighbors like Mount Rainier or Mount Hood.</p><h2>5. The cataclysmic 1980 explosion of Mount St. Helens was the volcano’s first major eruption in more than 100 years.</h2>

		<p>Prior to 1980, the last major explosive eruption of Mount St. Helens on record <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/Historical/LewisClark/Info/summary_mount_st_helens.shtml" target="_blank">occurred in 1800</a>. There were several minor explosions throughout the early 19th century up until 1857, when the volcano became dormant once again. This period of volcanic activity created what became known as the Goat Rocks Dome, which was part of Mount St. Helens’s distinctive silhouette until it was destroyed in the 1980 eruption.</p><h2>6. The 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption is still the most powerful volcanic eruption in U.S. history.</h2><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AYla6q3is6w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><br/>On the morning of May 18, 1980, a 5.1-magnitude earthquake caused a massive landslide—the largest debris avalanche in history—on the north face of Mount St. Helens. In the volcanic eruption that followed, the lateral blast destroyed every living and non-living thing within six miles of the volcano. The deadly <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/glossary/pyroclastic_surge.html" target="_blank">pyroclastic surge</a>—a fast-moving, super-hot cloud of ash, rock, and volcanic gas—traveled as much 18 miles away from the blast. The hot lava, gas, and debris mixed with melting snow and ice to form massive volcanic mudflows that surged down into valleys with enough force to rip trees from the ground, flatten homes, and completely destroy roads and bridges. Rivers rose rapidly, flooding surrounding valleys. Ash fell from the sky as far away as the Great Plains. Two-hundred-and-fifty miles away, ash blanketed Spokane, Washington, in complete darkness.</p><h2>7. A Mount St. Helens volcanologist likely saved hundreds of lives.</h2><p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/05/17/mount-st-helens-people-stayed/27311467/" target="_blank">Fifty-seven</a> people died as a result of the eruption, though the number could have been much higher. Volcanologist David Johnston was an advocate for restricting access to the volcano when, in early 1980, an increase in seismic activity signaled that an eruption might be imminent. Johnston died when the observation post from which he was monitoring Mount St. Helens was destroyed. “The volcano-monitoring effort of which Dave was part helped persuade the authorities first to limit access to the area around the volcano, and then to resist heavy pressure to reopen it, thereby holding the May 18 death toll to a few tens instead of hundreds or thousands,” according to the authors of the 1982 U.S. Geological Survey <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/observatories/cvo/david_johnston.html" target="_blank">professional paper</a> about the disaster.</p><h2>8. The eruption changed the appearance of Mount St. Helens forever.</h2><p>Prior to the 1980 eruption, Mount St. Helens had a symmetrical, snow-covered cone that gave it the nickname the “Mount Fuji of America.” The peak stood 9677 feet tall. But the lateral blast changed its appearance considerably: The top 1300 feet of the summit was destroyed by the eruption and landslide. Now, the volcano sports a north-facing, horseshoe-shaped crater that contains a lava dome and a glacier.</p><h2>9. Mount St. Helens was made into a national volcanic monument in 1982.</h2>

		<p>Two years after the devastating eruption, Congress turned the area around Mount St. Helens into a 110,000-acre <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/mount-st-helens/mount-st-helens-national-volcanic-monument?qt-science_support_page_related_con=2#qt-science_support_page_related_con" target="_blank">national volcanic monument</a> for research and recreation. Located within the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, it’s managed by the U.S. Forest Service. <a href="https://www.recreation.gov/permits/4675309" target="_blank">Visitors</a> can hike, camp, fish, and more, though hikers need a special permit to climb up to the summit. (This isn&#39;t permitted when the volcano is experiencing <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/giffordpinchot/news-events/?cid=FSBDEV3_006126" target="_blank">unusually high</a> activity, of course.) They can also tour the Johnston Ridge volcanic observatory and Ape Cave, a lava tube formed almost 2000 years ago.</p><h2>10. Mount St. Helens has been shrinking.</h2><p>A 1982 survey measured the summit of the volcano at 8365 feet tall. As of 2009, it measured 8330 feet. The shrinkage is probably the result of erosion and collapses of crater walls.</p><h2>11. Mount St. Helens is not done erupting.</h2><p>The U.S. Geological Survey still rates Mount St. Helens’s threat potential as “very high” because of the potential for eruptions and the number of nearby communities that those eruptions could impact. The volcano is just over 50 miles from Portland, Oregon, and less than 100 miles from Seattle. The 1980 eruption destroyed all structures around the nearby tourist destination of Spirit Lake, including more than 200 houses and cabins. Mount St. Helens’s <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/st_helens_geo_hist_100.html" target="_blank">most recent</a> volcanic activity stretched from 2004 to 2008, during which the volcano grew a new lava dome and periodically released plumes of steam and ash. There were few significant explosions before the volcanic activity died down in 2008.</p><p>While the U.S. Geological survey warns that Mount St. Helens will likely explode again during our lifetimes, the agency predicts that an explosion of the magnitude of the 1980 eruption is unlikely. However, scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network carefully <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/st_helens/monitoring_map.html" target="_blank">monitor</a> seismic data, gas emissions, changes in the ground surface, and other factors around Mount St. Helens to forecast potential volcanic activity.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/624139/mount-st-helens-facts?utm_source=RSS">11 Explosive Facts About Mount St. Helens</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In Latin America<em>, </em>Afro-Descendant communities were typically formed by escaped or freed enslaved people who sought refuge in remote areas. They have survived centuries of colonization, exploitation, and oppression. And while they have preserved their cultural traditions and languages, many groups experience poverty and lack access to resources, and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/climate-change">climate change</a>, industrialization, and land dispossession from their governments threaten their survival. Activists continue to advocate for the rights of these groups. These Afro-Latinx communities have long, resilient histories; here are eight you should know about. </p><h2>1. Garifuna // Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.refworld.org/docid/4954ce1823.html" target="_blank">Garifuna</a> are the descendants of indigenous Caribbean groups and escaped enslaved Africans. In the late 19th century, they migrated to Nicaragua, Guatemala, and neighboring countries in Central America, where they often worked in construction, agriculture, and logging. </p><p>The Garifuna were able to preserve their customs and languages by creating independent coastal communities. The passage of <a href="https://minorityrights.org/minorities/garifuna/" target="_blank">Law 445</a> in 2005 granted the Garifuna in Nicaragua land rights; this autonomy has continued to help protect their culture and heritage.</p><h2>2. Miskito // Honduras and Nicaragua</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321778703_The_rise_of_the_Mosquito_Kingdom_in_Central_America%27s_Caribbean_borderlands_Sources_questions_and_enduring_myths" target="_blank">Miskito Kingdom</a>—which stretched along the coasts of modern Nicaragua and Honduras—was internationally recognized from 1633 until 1894, when Nicaragua invaded and seized power. Now, Miskito people are <a href="https://minorityrights.org/minorities/miskito/" target="_blank">divided by the border</a> between the two countries. Many of those on the Nicaraguan side migrated to Honduras after conflicts with the country&#39;s Sandinista government in the 1980s. Today, they mainly subsist by raising cattle and poultry, fishing, and other forms of agriculture. They primarily speak Miskito Coast Creole, English, and Spanish. </p><h2>3. Malagasy // Peru</h2><p>The north Peruvian coast and southern coastal cities of Ica and Nazca are home to Peru’s <a href="https://aaregistry.org/story/afro-peruvians-a-brief-article/" target="_blank">Afro-Descendant </a>communities, the largest group of which is the <a href="https://solarey.net/african-descendants-peru-south-america/" target="_blank">Malagasy</a>. During colonial times, they were brought to Peru to work on plantations; today, their main source of income is agriculture and artisanal work. In 2009, Peru formally apologized to its citizens of African descent for centuries of oppression. 					</p><h2>4. Palenques // Colombia and Venezuela</h2><p>The Palenques in Colombia originated from a community created by freedom-seeking enslaved people from Cartagena. The Spanish declared the Palenque a sovereign people in the 18th century. Today, they mainly live in Palenque de San Basilio in Northern Colombia, as well as neighboring parts of Venezuela. In 2005, <a href="https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/cultural-space-of-palenque-de-san-basilio-00102" target="_blank">UNESCO</a> declared the area a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity site. </p><p><em>Palenque</em> is also the name of <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/world/2016/03/24/palenque-colombia-dying-language-palenquero-became-living-treasure/82098228/" target="_blank">the language</a> the communities speak. It’s <a href="https://www.colombia.co/en/colombia-country/environment/caribbean-region/san-basilio-de-palenque-first-free-town-africans-americas/" target="_blank">a combination</a> of European languages including Spanish, Portuguese, English, and French, as well as African Bantu languages. The number of remaining Palenque speakers is unknown, and the language’s use continues to decrease.</p><h2>5. Wayuu // Colombia and Venezuela</h2><p>The Wayuu people, “the people of the sun, sand, and wind,” are located in the Guajira peninsula of Venezuela, which borders Colombia. Their numbers are estimated to be in the hundred-thousands. Historically, their income depended on <a href="https://minorityrights.org/minorities/wayuu/" target="_blank">agriculture and fishing</a>. Today, the Wayuu <a href="https://www.hrw.org/video-photos/interactive/2020/08/13/people-resilience-colombias-wayuu-indigenous-community" target="_blank">continue to fight</a> for the preservation of and rights to their homelands.					</p><h2>6. Cambacuá // Paraguay</h2><p>The Cambacuá are located east of Paraguay’s capital, Asuncion. Former Uruguayan leaders displaced most of the Cambacuá from their land in the 20th century to create new buildings; additionally, the loss of agricultural work caused a mass exodus to urban areas [<a href="https://minorityrights.org/wp-content/uploads/old-site-downloads/download-83-Cambacua-an-afro-paraguayan-community.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]. The current Canbacuá population has declined, though the communities <a href="https://www.africanews.com/2022/01/10/afrodescendants-in-paraguay-celebrate-their-african-roots/" target="_blank">are working to preserve</a> their ethnic roots, despite the land dispossession and government erasure. </p><h2>7. Quilombolas // Brazil</h2><p>Freedom-seeking enslaved people formed communities called <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211216073312/http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/9/20/brazil-s-quilombosfoundedbyescapedslavesofferawindowtothepast.html" target="_blank">Quilombos</a> in secluded areas of Brazil. The largest settlement was Palmares—with a population of roughly 20,000 people—which the Portuguese conquered at the end of the 17th century. </p><p><a href="https://www.iaf.gov/content/story/making-their-own-way-brazils-quilombola-communities/" target="_blank">Quilombola</a> descendants have persisted despite colonization: The Quilombola Program has pinpointed more than 3500 communities, some of which now have <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/quilombola-communities-brazil" target="_blank">the official titles</a> to their land.  These families and villages have preserved their cultural traditions, and they speak African-influenced dialects elders have passed down through generations.</p><h2>8. Neo-Taino // Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic				</h2><p>Before the Spanish arrived, the Taino were the largest indigenous group in the Caribbean—their population is believed to have been <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/what-became-of-the-taino-73824867/" target="_blank">in the millions</a>. They lived in log houses and had hierarchical government and religious systems, and they <a href="https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/exploring-the-early-americas/columbus-and-the-taino.html" target="_blank">crafted goods</a> such as pottery, baskets, and jewelry. </p><p>Due to disease and enslavement, colonization reduced the population to mere thousands by the mid-16th century. Today, Afro-Caribbeans have the right to self-determine as Taino; this is known as the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/273887335_THE_INDIGENOUS_OR_NEO-TAINO_MOVEMENT_IN_THE_SPANISH-SPEAKING_CARIBBEAN_AND_ITS_DIASPORA_AND_THE_RETURN_OF_THE_OLD_ANGLO_NEO-IMPERIALIST_SCHOLARSHIP" target="_blank">Neo-Taino</a> movement in Puerto Rico.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/afro-latinx-communities?utm_source=RSS">8 Afro-Latinx Groups You Should Know About</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Some words <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/58036/50-words-sound-rude-actually-arent">sound dirty but actually aren’t</a>. Others <em>don’t</em> sound dirty, but their <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/12350/dirty-etymology-9-everyday-words">etymology suggests otherwise</a>. And then there are those words that usually are considered dirty—though only in certain contexts. From <em>titty</em> to <em>boner</em>, here are nine inappropriate words whose lesser-known definitions don’t ruffle any feathers.</p><h2>1. Titty</h2><p>In 19th-century England, you might call a cat or kitten a <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/202653#eid18193133" target="_blank"><em>titty</em></a>—or, even better, a <em>titty pussy</em>. <em>Tit</em> also has a whole host of obsolete meanings that have nothing to do with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502699/7-surprising-facts-about-the-breast">breasts</a>. As a <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/202524#eid18173036" target="_blank">noun</a>, it could refer to a young or small man, a young or small horse, a <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/202522?rskey=rqUyrc&amp;result=2&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank">tug or pull</a>, a <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/202525?rskey=rqUyrc&amp;result=6&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank">steel rod</a> used in nail manufacturing, and more. To <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/202530#eid18174126" target="_blank"><em>tit</em></a> someone in medieval Scotland, meanwhile, meant to grab them by force or put them to death by hanging.</p><h2>2. Dildo</h2>

		<p>Nobody really knows where the word <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/52768#eid6799441" target="_blank"><em>dildo</em></a> came from. But when it first started appearing in print in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, people were using it in songs and poems as a lilting nonsense word not unlike <em>la</em>. Here’s an <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EzlBAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA509&amp;lpg=PA509&amp;dq=here+with+me+thou+shalt+but+stay+only+til+i+can+display&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2Z_46MXnDU&amp;sig=ACfU3U1YthSZWx8N9ZAmaTfKtxbtDjAwHg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjx-JvT49r3AhWqTd8KHZ6DD9sQ6AF6BAgIEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=here%20with%20me%20thou%20shalt%20but%20stay%20only%20til%20i%20can%20display&amp;f=false" target="_blank">example</a> from Robert Jones’s 1601 <em>Second Book of Songs and Ayres</em>:</p><p><em>“Sweet, now go not yet, I pray;</em><br/><em>Let no doubt thy mind dismay.</em><br/><em>Here with me thou shalt but stay</em><br/><em>Only till I can display</em><br/><em>What I will do</em><br/><em>With a dildo,</em><br/><em>Sing do with a dildo.”</em></p><p>It&#39;s unclear whether such songs had anything to do with <em>dildo</em> in the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/647109/antique-vibrator-museum-san-francisco-good-vibrations">sex toy</a> sense, which started cropping up in print around the same time. In the late 17th century, the shape of those objects gave rise to yet another <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/52768#eid6799441" target="_blank">meaning</a>: “a downward-hanging sausage curl on a wig.” In his 1688 book <em>The Academy of Armory</em>, for example, Randle Holme <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A44230.0001.001/1:11.18.2?rgn=div3;submit=Go;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=dildo" target="_blank">described</a> a campaign wig as having “a Dildo on each side.”</p><h2>3. Prick</h2><p>If you’re not using <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/151148#eid28302581" target="_blank"><em>prick</em></a> as a personal insult or slang for male genitalia, it might just be functioning as a synonym for <em>pierce</em> or <em>poke</em>. It also once described wine or beer whose flavor had gone sour; as in, “All the wine that pricks,” from a 1731 essay by Peter Shaw. To “prick a hare” meant to track a hare; and “prick and praise” meant “the praise of excellence or success,” per the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/151146?rskey=DWiuyQ&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank">Oxford English Dictionary</a>.</p><p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, some people even used <em>prick </em>as a term of endearment for men—though this trend was almost definitely related to the <em>prick</em>-as-<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/527234/12-facts-about-penis"><em>penis</em></a> sense. “Ah, ha! are we not alone, my prick? ... Let us go together into my inner bed-chamber,” a character says in Desiderius Erasmus’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DFssAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22my+prick%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22my%20prick%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Colloquies</em></a>, translated in 1671.</p><h2>4. Poop</h2><p>The history of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/poop">poop</a> doesn’t just involve feces and ship decks. Back in the 16th century, it could <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/147744?rskey=YKLGHD&amp;result=7&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank">mean</a> “to fool or deceive.” “Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat for worms,” one character <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1537/1537-h/1537-h.htm" target="_blank">says</a> in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/558313/facts-about-william-shakespeare">Shakespeare’s</a> <em>Pericles</em>,<em> Prince of Tyre</em>. <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/147742?rskey=dIgvut&amp;result=5&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank"><em>Poop</em></a> was also a 20th-century military slang term for the latest information—especially if it was confidential or important enough to be memorized.</p><h2>5. Twat</h2>

		<p><a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/80685765?rskey=4PV3fb&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank"><em>Twat</em></a>, in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/575511/british-slang-words-you-should-know">British slang</a>, can mean to hit someone or something. But in Robert Browning’s 1841 verse drama <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/50954/50954-h/50954-h.htm" target="_blank"><em>Pippa Passes</em></a>, he used it to <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/207945?rskey=RksYLu&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank">describe</a> a nonspecific item—maybe part of a habit—that nuns wear:</p><p><em>“Then, owls and bats,</em><br/><em>Cowls and twats,</em><br/><em>Monks and nuns, in a cloister&#39;s moods,</em><br/><em>Adjourn to the oak-stump pantry!”</em></p><p>This was strange, considering <em>twat</em> had never been used to discuss a nun&#39;s garb before, and Oxford English Dictionary co-founder Frederick J. Furnivall later <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=eqvQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=The+ballad+is+partly+quoted+in+the+Appendix+to+Forster%E2%80%99s+Life+of+Vane,+but+the+above+lines+are+left+out%E2%80%94I+remember+them,+however,+and+the+word+struck+me+as+a+distinctive+part+of+a+nun%E2%80%99s+attire+that+might+fitly+pair+off+with+the+cowl+appropriated+to+a+monk.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CcrylsdEq3&amp;sig=ACfU3U1m2KPsYJ7ifZWTgwMIZ05CmWZw_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiOrMWO0Nr3AhURVd8KHSZ4A-kQ6AF6BAgDEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20ballad%20is%20partly%20quoted%20in%20the%20Appendix%20to%20Forster%E2%80%99s%20Life%20of%20Vane%2C%20but%20the%20above%20lines%20are%20left%20out%E2%80%94I%20remember%20them%2C%20however%2C%20and%20the%20word%20struck%20me%20as%20a%20distinctive%20part%20of%20a%20nun%E2%80%99s%20attire%20that%20might%20fitly%20pair%20off%20with%20the%20cowl%20appropriated%20to%20a%20monk.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false" target="_blank">wrote</a> to Browning inquiring about the word choice. The poet responded that he’d heard the term in a 17th-century ballad called “<a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/eebo/A96040.0001.001/1:1?rgn=div1;view=fulltext" target="_blank">Vanity of Vanities, or Sir Harry Vane’s Picture</a>,” which contains these bawdy lines:</p><p><em>“They talk’t of his having a Cardinalls Hat,</em><br/><em>They’d send him as soon an Old Nuns Twat”</em></p><p>As Browning wrote in his letter to Furnivall, “the word struck me as a distinctive part of a nun’s attire that might fitly pair off with the cowl appropriated to a monk.” The ballad was not, unfortunately, talking about attire.</p><h2>6. Ass </h2><p>It’s a donkey, it’s a derrière, and it’s a multi-purpose curse word. But if you’re making paper by hand, per the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/11702#eid37381009" target="_blank">OED</a>, it’s a “curved wooden post” along the rim of your vat that you can place your mold on while it drains. It’s sometimes referred to as a <em>donkey-rest</em>, so the term is apparently unrelated to body parts. (Considering that <em>donkey-engine</em> and <em>donkey-pump</em> <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Century_Dictionary_and_Cyclopedia_Di/n3lHAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22paper%22+%22donkey-rest%22&amp;pg=PA1731&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">described</a> small, supplemental steam engines and steam pumps, it seems like <em>donkey</em> was a popular modifier for tools of an auxiliary nature.)</p><h2>7. Booby</h2><p>Primarily in Australia, the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/21393#eid16765753" target="_blank"><em>booby</em></a> (or the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/21387?rskey=R5uiZ8&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank"><em>boob</em></a>) is prison. You can even <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/21388?rskey=R5uiZ8&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank">boob</a> someone, meaning “put in prison.” <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/73522531#eid1259974550" target="_blank"><em>Booby house</em></a> is another old synonym for prison; it can also refer to a closed compartment or cabin on a ship. And <em>booby</em> alone (plus <em>booby hack</em>, <em>booby hut</em>, and <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/72488815#eid1259832560" target="_blank"><em>booby hutch</em></a>) also once described an enclosed horse-drawn sleigh common in New England. In 1870, for example, <em>The Boston Post</em> mentioned “Two elegant new Boobies, nearly finished.” </p><h2>8. Boner</h2>

		<p><a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/21308?redirectedFrom=boner#eid" target="_blank"><em>Boners</em></a> are slaughterhouse employees responsible for stripping meat from animal bones, as well as cows whose meat is only good for lesser beef products. But to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/652383/victorian-era-history-timeline">Victorian</a> schoolchildren, <em>boners</em> were punches or other bodily blows. In Edmund Lechmere’s 1844 drama <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=loc.ark:/13960/t1mg8wd90&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=13&amp;skin=2021&amp;q1=bully" target="_blank"><em>The Charter House Play</em></a>, for instance, one schoolboy reacts to a classmate’s kitchen calamity with this rhyming response:</p><p><em>“Oh! how he’ll catch it from that bully Steady,</em><br/><em>If, after prayers, the supper is not ready.</em><br/><em>Poor Scrub! what licks, what boners I foresee;</em><br/><em>I’m hanged if I a’nt glad it was not me.”</em></p><h2>9. Slut</h2><p>When Samuel Pepys called one of his domestic staff members “a most admirable slut” in a 1664 diary entry, he didn’t intend to offend. At the time, <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/182346?rskey=oLIPbg&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid" target="_blank"><em>slut</em></a> could refer to a scullery maid or any other lowly female servant. It was also just a catch-all term for <em>female</em>. “We country sluts of merry Fressingfield / Come to buy needless naughts, to make us fine,” one character <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/55769/55769-h/55769-h.htm" target="_blank">says</a> in Robert Greene’s Elizabethan comedy <em>Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay</em>.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/dirty-words-with-appropriate-meanings?utm_source=RSS">9 Dirty Words With Completely Appropriate Secondary Definitions</a>. </p>]]>

      <description>In the new millennium, fashion took a turn toward the maximalist with perilously low-rise jeans, mini-skirts that dared to bare all if you had to bend in any way, graphic tees that let you broadcast your mood to the world, and rhinestones everywhere.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the new millennium, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/fashion" target="_self">fashion</a> took a turn toward the maximalist. The early to mid-1990s had down-to-earth grunge looks and severely chic minimalism, but by later in the decade and into the early aughts the sparkly, candy-colored fashions of pop stars like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67594/slam-it-left-these-10-facts-about-spice-girls" target="_self">The Spice Girls</a> and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/630378/britney-spears-music-facts" target="_self">Britney Spears</a> started to filter into contemporary teen style. In these innocent years before social media influencers became style guides, the fashion-obsessed masses took cues from magazines and celebrities. As is so often the case in fashion, a lot of these trends (many of which—let’s be real—weren’t that cute to begin with) are now coming back in style, especially among Gen Z-ers who weren’t even born when the looks first trended.</p><p>While we may not want to squirm back into a pair of low-rise jeans anytime soon, it’s still fun to reflect on some of the chaotic but occasionally cute trends that defined the 2000s. Here are 20 of them.</p><h2>1. Juicy Couture Tracksuits</h2>
			<figure>

		<p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-juicy-couture-tracksuits-2019-11" target="_blank">Velour Juicy Couture tracksuits</a>, with their signature J-shaped zippers and form-fitting-yet-comfortable cuts, were the unofficial uniform of “off-duty” celebrities and high school mean girls alike. Before brands like Lululemon and Outdoor Voices came to represent athleisure in the social media age, Juicy Couture defined the idea of leisurewear as a status item, making matching hoodies and sweatpants seem chic rather than dowdy through the power of celebrity branding and a high price tag.</p><h2>2. Trucker Hats</h2>

		<p>Truck drivers may seem like an unlikely source of fashion inspiration, but the aughts were a strange time. For a brief but unforgettable period, <a href="https://www.nylon.com/fashion/the-trucker-hat-trend-is-back-from-the-early-2000s" target="_blank">trucker hats</a>—often emblazoned with cutesy phrases like “Drama Queen” or the logo of then-omnipresent brand Von Dutch—could be spotted on the heads of many celebrities. These mesh-lined baseball caps embodied the era’s obsession with high/low styling, appropriating an accessory often associated with blue collar workers in the name of trendiness.</p><h2>3. Low-Rise Jeans</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_970,x_0,y_14/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-71428865-95cb2e13751cc9a18c78c1e5569e7186.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Evan Agostini/Getty Images" alt="Kate Hudson was high on the low-rise jean trend in 2006.">

		<p>Whether embellished with rhinestones, intentionally distressed, bootcut, or worn head-to-toe (thanks, <a href="https://people.com/style/britney-spears-justin-timberlake-matching-denim-moment-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank">Britney and Justin</a>), denim was truly doing the most in the 2000s. The most prevalent denim abomination of the time was unquestionably <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/shelbyheinrich/times-fashion-in-the-2000s-defied-the-laws-of-gravity" target="_blank">low-rise jeans</a>. In an era when washboard abs were presented as the height of sex appeal, perilously low-rise jeans (sometimes paired with visible thong underwear if you were feeling particularly spicy) became the dominant form of denim, making a garment often worn for casual comfort into something more bold and ready to be shown off.</p><h2>4. Miniskirts</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_970,x_0,y_7/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-1725435-0-da3f9eb4d564f28045dd05013da5583b.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Frederick M.

		<p><a href="https://www.whowhatwear.com/denim-miniskirts" target="_blank">Miniskirts</a> have been a fashion staple since first gaining popularity in the &#39;60s, but they became more mini than ever in the 2000s. Denim miniskirts, often looking like a perilously small rectangle, were commonplace. Many of the common miniskirt silhouettes at the time included ruffled edges referred to as bubble hems. Some of these micro-minis were cute and flirtatious—but you just had to be careful to not drop your keys, lest you reveal too much.</p><h2>5. Butterfly Clips</h2>

		<p>A lot of early &#39;00s fashion trends were holdovers from the late &#39;90s, and <a href="https://www.lofficielusa.com/beauty/y2k-2000s-hair-trend-tiktok-celebrity" target="_blank">butterfly clips</a> were no exception. These dainty, butterfly-shaped clips may not have been the most practical, seeing as they barely held any hair in their colorful plastic claws, but they added a whimsical touch of femininity to any look, and served as the ideal complement to the updos that were popular at the time.</p><h2>6. Crop Tops</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_970,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-1596417-f51022e36e666184f6d672b2249a9c18.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images" alt="Christina Aguilera wears a baby tee to the 2002 premiere of 8 Mile in Westwood, California.">

		<p>If you were going to wear some stylish low-rise jeans or a miniskirt, there’s a good chance you’d be topping it off with a <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/hit-me-baby-one-more-time-thes" target="_blank">crop top</a>. These belly-revealing shirts, also known as baby tees, came in a variety of fabrics and colors (some were even &#34;popcorn shirts&#34; made of weird, ultra-stretchy fabric), and could look sweet or edgy depending on how they were styled. Later in the decade, American Apparel pushed a hipper, more minimal kind of crop top, and in recent years the shirts have become a common sight at teen-favorite shops like Brandy Melville.</p><h2>7. Flip Flops</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_970,x_0,y_64/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-2311072-bab15cfa4e5e391137dd24e25a1bac3b.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Evan Agostini/Getty Images" alt="Lindsay Lohan wears her "fancy" flip flops to an HBO event in the Hamptons in 2001.">

			</figure>
		<p>It’s a wonder that more women weren’t constantly injuring their ankles, given how popular <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/the-flip-flop-heel-trend-is-about-to-make-your-summer-style-nostalgic-af-17997092" target="_blank">flip flops</a> were in the aughts. These simple sandals, which are really best suited to the beach, became an everyday staple, often paired with capris or a minidress. Traditional flip flops were in style, but the emblematic pairs of the time sported heels or chunky platforms, convincing a generation of women to fool themselves into thinking a strap awkwardly wedged between the toes was both comfortable <em>and</em> stylish.</p><h2>8. Ugg Boots</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_1092,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-85371236-6cf5d6a8959a5dee29714bb775839ce9.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Ray Tamarra/Getty Images" alt="Blake Lively and her trusty Uggs on the set of Gossip Girl in 2009.">

			</figure>
		<p>Squishy and shearling trimmed, <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/fashion-runway-ugg-boots" target="_blank">Ugg boots</a> looked better suited to a ski lodge than a paparazzi shot, but the Australian brand became an unlikely &#39;00s icon. The boots were comfortable and able to be worn without socks, giving them a grab-and-go vibe that was highly versatile. Uggs may not have been the cutest boots, but their slightly homely yet chic look, expensive-but-not-outrageous price tag, and carefree vibe made them a status item.</p><h2>9. Dresses Over Pants</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_1092,x_0,y_18/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-52580542-23316fac8bb2770c79f4276044f1abcb.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Matthew Simmons/Getty Images" alt="Dress or jeans?

			</figure>
		<p>Unsure whether you want to wear a dress or a pair of pants? Back in the &#39;00s, you could wear both at the same time. This <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Dress-Over-Jeans-Trend-From-2000s-45724646" target="_blank">unholy pairing</a>, which showed up on a surprising number of red carpets, sought to mix the casual and the cutesy. A dress over jeans said you were girly enough to wear a dress but edgy enough to pair it with something unexpected. The end result may have been awkward, but hey, it’s the thought that counts.</p><h2>10. Logomania</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_722,h_481,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-631503104-d8178118cebe53865ff0acac120ca662.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Christian Vierig/Getty Images" alt="German fashion blogger/model Alexandra Lapp wears a retro Gucci logo T-shirt in Florence, Italy.">

			</figure>
		<p><a href="http://coulture.org/logomania-the-2000s-and-celebrity-culture/" target="_blank">Logos were everywhere</a> in the aughts. They could be found plastered on T-shirts, sneakers, bags, and even the rears of shorts and sweatpants. Before there was social media, branding oneself often came from dressing like a walking billboard. Designer logos for high-fashion houses like Chanel, Dior, and Fendi were sought-after (and frequently knocked-off) status symbols—and perfectly symbolized the excesses of pop culture at the time—while logos for streetwear brands like Baby Phat and FUBU became synonymous with the mainstreaming of hip-hop style.</p><h2>11. Cargo Pants</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_970,x_0,y_47/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-2282626-03345e3c5fbcdf61fbe88a95e98397bc.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Scott Gries/ImageDirect via Getty Images" alt="Jessica Simpson gets militaristic as she rehearses for the MTV TRL Tour in a pair of oversized cargo pants in 2001.">
				<figcaption>Jessica Simpson gets militaristic as she rehearses for the MTV TRL Tour in a pair of oversized cargo pants in 2001. | Scott Gries/ImageDirect via Getty Images</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>With their baggy shape and abundance of pockets, <a href="https://www.lofficielusa.com/fashion/cargo-pants-trend-instagram" target="_blank">cargo pants</a> aren’t exactly known for being flattering, but they were a tomboyish essential in the &#39;00s, often paired with a tank top for maximum casual cuteness. The popularity of these pants may have had something to do with the patriotic, militaristic national mood that permeated the culture. Or maybe they were just more comfortable than those pesky low-rise jeans that were so popular.</p><h2>12. Designer Purses</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_727,h_969,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-84219266-e283b469d2e09c96d2e5c5515c99ead1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Rob Loud/Getty Images" alt="Model Agyness Deyn shows off her Stephen Sprouse-designed Louis Vuitton bag in 2009.">

			</figure>
		<p>In a period obsessed with status and branding, <a href="https://www.anothermag.com/fashion-beauty/11039/five-early-00s-it-bags-that-are-making-a-comeback" target="_blank">“It” bags</a> carried by the rich and famous became the ultimate mark of a fashionista. While the luxury design houses that produced these bags had been around for decades, their accessories gained wider recognition thanks to fashion-conscious shows like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64729/15-fabulous-facts-about-sex-and-city" target="_self"><em>Sex and the City</em> </a>and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/504518/xoxo-20-things-you-might-not-know-about-gossip-girl" target="_self"><em>Gossip Girl</em></a>. Playful designer collaborations like Stephen Sprouse’s and Takashi Murakami’s Louis Vuitton bags broadened the appeal of a legacy brand with pop imagery, and bags by Balenciaga, Chloé, and Dior, among others, were draped on the arms of many a starlet.</p><h2>13. Rhinestone Embellishments</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_1092,x_0,y_24/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-1512495-ae7cdcac44517a9628c7af0f64ebd6af.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Online USA/Getty Images" alt="Gabrielle Union is decked out in rhinestones for the Los Angeles premiere Bring It On in 2000.">
				<figcaption>Gabrielle Union is decked out in rhinestones for the Los Angeles premiere Bring It On in 2000. | Online USA/Getty Images</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>Practically anything that could be worn in the aughts could be bedazzled. Tops, jeans, shoes, even cellphones—all were fair game for <a href="https://www.thezoereport.com/p/jlos-00s-style-includes-5-trends-everyone-will-be-wearing-in-2021-54355143" target="_blank">rhinestone embellishments</a>. The sparkle of a rhinestone on an otherwise casual garment instantly elevated it to camp status. Rhinestones are totally unsubtle and proudly fake, and that’s what made them the official gem of the era.</p><h2>14. “Going-Out” Tops</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_1092,x_0,y_46/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-2117554-81de0aa73dfc81c83eb231e9eaa12531.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images" alt="Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen go out in their "going-out" tops in 2003.">
				<figcaption>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen go out in their "going-out" tops in 2003. | Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>Any top can be a going-out top if you want, but the <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/going-out-top-what-happened_l_608836cee4b04620270016e1" target="_blank">going-out tops of the 2000s</a> have a particular look that’s unmistakably of the time. The classic going-out top was often drapey, decked with sparkles, and inevitably paired with low-rise bootcut jeans. These tops conveyed the message of being down to party but not so precious about it that you’re going to put on a dress, and were frequently available at a burgeoning array of fast fashion retailers.</p><h2>15. Skinny Scarves</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_1092,x_0,y_25/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-51325603-fb68db0d91ad638b4340b906e5393a09.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Dave Benett/Getty Images" alt="Scarves were a year-round necessity in the 2000s, as long as it was a skinny scarf—as Kate Moss proves in 2004.">

			</figure>
		<p>Whether tied around one’s neck or over a tunic or pair of pants as a makeshift belt, the <a href="https://galoremag.com/chokers-dead-2000s-skinny-scarf-comeback-just-beginning/" target="_blank">skinny scarf</a> was a staple. These scarves gave any outfit a touch of hip <em>je ne sais quoi</em>. They were a simple, easy-to-wear but passably stylish accessory that could look hipster, boho, or emo, depending on the rest of the outfit.</p><h2>16. Ed Hardy Tattoo Prints</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_727,h_1090,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-52964767-81e2bdfeb6526212945f8750c5017209.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Frazer Harrison/Getty Images" alt="A model debuts Christian Audigier's Ed Hardy Vintage Tattoo Wear line at a 2005 fashion show in Los Angeles.">
				<figcaption>A model debuts Christian Audigier's Ed Hardy Vintage Tattoo Wear line at a 2005 fashion show in Los Angeles. | Frazer Harrison/Getty Images</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>As tattoos became more and more commonplace, so too did tattoo-print clothing. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bnpdy5/are-we-ready-for-an-ed-hardy-comeback-456" target="_blank">Ed Hardy shirts and caps</a>, featuring garish images of iconic tattoos, were a must-have for the reality stars of the day. Ed Hardy designs embodied hard-partying bro energy, with a vibe that suggested you were tough enough to rock tattoo imagery but still cared about brand names.</p><h2>17. Graphic Tees</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_696,h_928,x_24,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-2330093-defc90c59e7b1a14db87dfdea065bcb3.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Evan Agostini/ImageDirect via Getty Images" alt="Paris Hilton let everyone know she was the Queen of the Universe in 2002.">
				<figcaption>Paris Hilton let everyone know she was the Queen of the Universe in 2002. | Evan Agostini/ImageDirect via Getty Images</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>“PRINCESS,” “BABE,” “QUEEN OF THE UNIVERSE”—these were just a few of the many <a href="https://www.crfashionbook.com/fashion/g33865177/celebrity-slogan-tees-britney-spears-paris-hilton/" target="_blank">appellations splashed across T-shirts</a> in the 2000s. These sassy tops pedaled a simplistic branded version of girl power, with an early-meme-like directness. Celebrities like Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Britney Spears often wore graphic tees as a means of winking at their tabloid personas, and were spotted in shirts reading “STOP BEING DESPERATE,” “SKINNY BITCH,” and “DUMP HIM,” respectively. That’s certainly one way to make a statement.</p><h2>18. Tinted Sunglasses</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_466,h_621,x_36,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-1316846-24a285b3388af406eff7179c4949801d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Arnaldo Magnani/Liaison via Getty Images" alt="Mary J.

			</figure>
		<p>Sunglasses in the &#39;00s were more often worn to look cool than to protect one’s eyes from the sun. Aviator sunglasses with <a href="https://stylecaster.com/2000s-tinted-sunglasses-trend/" target="_blank">pale tinted lenses</a> (often in shades of brown or pink) were a must-have accessory that added a diva vibe to any outfit. While dark sunglasses are invariably better for your eyes, tinted ones at least have the benefit of making you look like you just stepped out of a music video.</p><h2>19. Shrugs</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_1092,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-53510846-4f7c4a696dece9749f323be00058cdbf.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Evan Agostini/Getty Images" alt="Shrugs were a staple of Rihanna's wardrobe in the mid-2000s, as seen at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards in Miami.">

			</figure>
		<p>Was it a sweater? A vest? A glorified scarf? The shrunken shoulder coverings known as <a href="https://www.instyle.com/fashion/rihanna-outfits-2005-style" target="_blank">shrugs</a> were some of the most confusing garments of the aughts. At a time when there was no such thing as too many accessories, it made perfect sense that an article of clothing as seemingly frivolous as the shrug would come into fashion.</p><h2>20. Fedoras</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_728,h_485,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/647627-gettyimages-2121988-3c6a314a1dc35922d78cdeec04533955.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Kevin Winter/Getty Images" alt="Britney Spears knew how to tilt her fedora just right in 2003.">

		<p>Oh, <a href="https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/celebrity-fedora-hats-152229/" target="_blank">fedoras</a>. The classic hat was so cool in the Old Hollywood era but became so cringey decades later. Worn by men and women alike, the fedora of the 2000s often topped off a gaudy outfit with a rigid brim worn at a jaunty angle. These fedoras didn’t have the understated suavity they did in earlier decades, but rather felt like one more exaggerated accessory in an era that was positively full of them.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/647627/major-fashion-trends-2000s-2010s?utm_source=RSS">20 Unforgettable Fashion Trends of the Past 20 Years (Even If You'd Like to Forget Them)</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s an amazing time to be a<em> </em><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/87513/20-fascinating-facts-about-doctor-who"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> fan. It was recently announced that <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/ncuti-gatwa-new-doctor-who-star">Ncuti Gatwa</a> will be taking over the role of everyone’s favorite Time Lord following <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/559757/facts-about-jodie-whittaker-doctor-who">Jodie Whittaker</a>’s final appearance as the Thirteenth Doctor later this year. Now, BBC has announced that both <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/540376/facts-about-david-tennant-doctor-who">David Tennant</a>, who played the beloved Tenth Doctor, and Catherine Tate, who played his companion Donna Noble, will be returning for the long-running sci-fi series&#39; 60th-anniversary special, which airs in 2023.</p><p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/doctor-who"><em>Doctor Who</em></a> has always had a knack for pulling off these kinds of big crossover specials. It did something similar with its 50th anniversary special, which featured both Tennant’s Tenth Doctor and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/569593/doctor-who-star-matt-smith-auditioned-for-the-inbetweeners">Matt Smith</a>’s Eleventh Doctor. But <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/544287/doctor-who-creator-regret-russell-davies">Russell T. Davies</a>, who revived the legendary series in 2005 and is <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/650594/russell-t-davies-returns-doctor-who">coming back as showrunner</a> for its next season, warns that we might not see Tennant in the way we expect. Considering that this is a show with time travel, alternate dimensions, and other fantastical trappings, anything could happen.</p><p>“Maybe this is a missing story. Or a parallel world. Or a dream, or a trick, or a flashback,” <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/2022/doctor-who-david-tennant-and-catherine-tate-return" target="_blank">Davies teased</a> in a press release. “The only thing I can confirm is that it’s going to be spectacular, as two of our greatest stars reunite for the battle of a lifetime.”</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKeul7kjKO8?start=1875&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>When we last saw Donna and The Doctor together, he had just wiped her memory to save her life after she absorbed a huge amount of Time Lord energy from the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/501051/new-%E2%80%98doctor-who%E2%80%99-game-turns-your-phone-tardis">TARDIS</a>, briefly becoming Doctor Donna until it began fracturing her human mind. Their parting was heartbreaking, so it will be interesting to see how the show works these characters back into the story without undermining what’s generally regarded as a high point in the series.</p><p>Davies is taking over <em>Doctor Who</em> again to introduce Gatwa, but he was also the showrunner back when Tennant and Tate were both series regulars, from 2005 to 2010 and 2006 and 2010, respectively.</p><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxB1gB6K-2A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Whittaker&#39;s final performance as the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/550763/bbc-launches-doctor-who-merchandise-thirteenth-doctor-jodie-whittaker">Thirteenth Doctor</a> is due later this year in the <a href="https://winteriscoming.net/2022/03/04/doctor-who-regeneration-will-be-feature-length-special/" target="_blank">regeneration special</a>, which is when Gatwa will make his first appearance as the Fourteenth Doctor.

William II </h2><p>William II <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/weird-royal-deaths">died under questionable circumstances</a> while out hunting in the New Forest in 1100; some have claimed that he was assassinated to secure his younger brother Henry’s claim to the throne. Oddly, he wasn’t the only member of the family to succumb to that fate: William’s elder brother, Richard, also <a href="https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29448?docPos=2" target="_blank">died in a hunting accident</a> in the New Forest around the 1070s, while his nephew, another Richard, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1f3cAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">died in a hunting accident</a> in the New Forest in 1099.</p><h2>3.

The rest of his body was buried in England.</p><h2>4. Stephen</h2><p>Stephen, son of one of William the Conqueror’s daughters, could credit a bout of diarrhea with saving his life. On November 25, 1120, a vessel called the <em>White Ship</em> was chartered to carry the present king Henry I and much of his family and court (Stephen among them) across the English Channel from France to England. Henry, however, had made other arrangements for himself, leaving the rest of his court to travel on the <em>White Ship</em> as planned. </p><p>The overcrowded ship sank off the coast of Normandy. Of the 300 or so people on board, only one or two survived; among those who died was the king’s only surviving legitimate son, William. Henry I decided to name his daughter Matilda as the successor, but when Henry died she was an unpopular choice, allowing Stephen to claim the throne in a period of civil crisis known as <a href="https://www.history.co.uk/articles/the-anarchy-england-s-dark-period-of-lawlessness-and-war" target="_blank">the Anarchy</a>. He had reportedly left the <em>White Ship</em> before it departed <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Stephen_and_Matilda/Ja4TDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=diarrhoea" target="_blank">due to a sudden bout of diarrhea</a>.</p><h2>5. Henry II</h2><p>Henry II died in Chinon, France. He had wanted to be buried at <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Henry_the_Young_King_1155_1183/kXpJDAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Grandmont+Abbey+henry+ii&amp;pg=PA453&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">Grandmont Abbey</a>, in the southern part of the country, after he died. But the weather was too hot to transport his corpse that far, so he was instead interred at an abbey closer to his place of death.</p><h2>6. Richard I </h2>

		<p>Richard I was shot through the shoulder with a crossbow outside of Chalus Castle in France in March 1199. The injury was serious, but survivable—but the infection that followed it was not. He died two weeks later on April 6. His <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/63428/10-people-whose-hearts-were-buried-separately-rest-them">heart was buried separately</a> from the rest of his body.</p><p>As for the arrow that brought down Richard the Lionheart?

It became immortalized as “the lion by the ant was slain.”</p><h2>7. King John </h2><p>King John was reportedly the first English monarch—and perhaps even the first medieval king in Europe—to own what Latin wardrobe records refer to as a “<em>supertunicam domini Regis ad surgendum de nocte</em>,” or a “king’s over-shirt for rising in the night.” In other words, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7b9bqirm4WcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=supertunicam+%22ad+surgendum+de+nocte%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP6qy79u3SAhVmGsAKHR5lAbkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=supertunicam%20%22ad%20surgendum%20de%20nocte%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">John owned a dressing gown</a>.</p><h2>8.

		<p>In his campaign against Scotland, Edward I more than earned his nickname “<a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Hammer_of_the_Scots/CYSuCAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=The+Hammer+of+the+Scots&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">The Hammer of the Scots</a>.” During the Siege of Stirling Castle in 1304, Edward commissioned the construction of a gigantic trebuchet (perhaps the largest in history) that became known as the Warwolf. The sight of the enormous catapult being constructed outside the castle walls was enough to compel those inside to offer an unconditional surrender—but Edward had none of it, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=Vp2r3xyaDaEC&amp;q=warwolf#v=snippet&amp;q=warwolf&amp;f=false" target="_blank">did not accept the surrender</a> until after he had tried the Warwolf out.</p><h2>10. Edward II</h2><p>In 1313, Edward II <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/aep/Edw2/7/0/section/wrapper1" target="_blank">enacted a statute</a> forbidding the wearing of armor in Parliament.

		<p>Henry VI was the only child of Henry V, and his father’s unexpected death meant that he became king when he was just 9 months old. He reigned almost 40 years over a 50-year timespan (he was deposed for almost a decade by Edward IV).</p><p>He <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kvGjCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22pure+melancholy+and+displeasure%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKxMnZhO7SAhVJAsAKHc0iBHEQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pure%20melancholy%20and%20displeasure%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">supposedly died from</a> “pure melancholy and displeasure” on hearing of the death of his son, Edward of Westminster, in 1471 (although many historians suspect he was murdered on Edward IV’s orders). Shortly after, a movement emerged to have Henry canonized as a saint. The many miracles “Saint Henry” is supposed to have been responsible for include saving a drowned boy, curing a man of scrofula, and <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cj08AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Alice+Newnett&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjn5PHGhO7SAhVrIcAKHTwUBcAQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">resurrecting a young girl named Alice Newnett</a>, who had died of the plague.</p><h2>16. Edward IV</h2><p>Edward IV and his House of York took the throne from the opposing House of Lancaster in March 1461, following his victory at the extraordinarily violent Battle of Towton. Fought during a blinding snowstorm on Palm Sunday, Towton is believed to be <a href="https://www.history.co.uk/articles/the-battle-of-towton-the-largest-and-bloodiest-battle-ever-fought-on-english-soil" target="_blank">the biggest and bloodiest battle</a> ever fought on English soil: Somewhere between 50,000 and 60,000 troops were involved, of whom a contemporary account estimated 28,000 were killed. Put another way, the Battle of Towton wiped out 1 percent of the entire population of England at the time. Given such a bloody start to his reign, Edward IV has been credited as being, perhaps unsurprisingly, the first king in English history <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FSvAegniXsUC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;lpg=PA223&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">to appoint a bodyguard</a>.</p><h2>17. Edward V</h2><p>Edward V is both <a href="https://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/KingsQueensofBritain/" target="_blank">shortest-lived English monarch</a> post-conquest and the shortest-reigning English king (albeit uncrowned). Although his fate as one of the ill-fated <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/579220/war-of-the-roses-facts">Princes in the Tower</a> is unclear, it has long been (controversially) assumed that he was murdered after just 78 days on throne on the orders of his successor, Richard III. He was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/edward_v_king.shtml" target="_blank">just 12 years old</a> at the time.</p><h2>18. Richard III</h2>

Before then, royal monetary portraiture was largely stylized and comprised little more than a crowned head, but a groat (equal to four pence) minted in London sometime around 1507 was embossed with a <a href="https://www.coingallery.de/KarlV/Engl1_E.htm#vv" target="_blank">surprisingly realistic profile portrait of the king</a>.</p><h2>20.

		<p>Despite his youth (he was 9 when he as crowned and 15 when he died), Edward VI is credited with being <a href="https://archive.org/stream/kingedwardviana01markgoog#page/n208/mode/1up" target="_blank">the first English monarch</a> to charter an exploration of the Arctic. The king was a keen geographer and had <a href="https://archive.org/stream/kingedwardviana01markgoog#page/n205/mode/1up" target="_blank">learned to read a compass</a> from the Venetian explorer Sebastian Cabot.</p><p>In 1553, Cabot championed an expedition, led by Sir Hugh Willoughby, to reach China via the Arctic Sea; Willoughby <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rsLxqtb1EYkC&amp;pg=PT29&amp;lpg=PT29&amp;dq=edward+vi+arctic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vyXCC8_GB0&amp;sig=zqgERVlAvB5qy-J5O_b7a5yXhMs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiWuqvF-u7SAhVMI8AKHYA6ClkQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=edward%20vi%20arctic&amp;f=false" target="_blank">took with him letters</a> signed by Edward VI and addressed to “the Kings, Princes, and other Potentates inhabiting the Northeast partes of the worlde.” Unfortunately, after a harsh storm, Willoughby’s ships became encased in ice east of Murmansk and the entire crew perished. But one of the other captains, Richard Chancellor, found himself in Russia, where the letter was delivered to Ivan the Terrible and opened trade between England and Russia.</p><h2>22. Mary I</h2><p>After Edward VI&#39;s death in 1553, 16-year-old Lady Jane Grey—the great-granddaughter of Henry VII—ascended the throne. She had been named Edward&#39;s successor in a bid to keep Protestant control of England. Despite her youth, she was exceptionally well read and spoke Latin, Hebrew, and Italian. </p><p>Her &#34;reign&#34; (which historians still debate) lasted just nine days; she was deposed by <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/648540/king-henry-viii-children">Mary I</a>—a.k.a. Bloody Mary—on July 19, 1553, and was eventually executed in February 1554.

George III</h2><p>There’s a myth that on July 4, 1776, George III wrote in his diary, “Nothing of importance happened today.” In fact, <a href="https://newsfeed.time.com/2012/07/04/10-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-fourth-of-july/slide/much-ado-about-nothing-of-importance/" target="_blank">he didn’t even keep a diary</a>.

Godfrey <a href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/127742365" target="_blank">loved</a> fly-fishing, Fleming loved fiction, and shortly after the start of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/world-war-two">World War II</a>, they drew from those hobbies to produce the Trout Memo—a top-secret laundry list of deception tactics that likened the art of subterfuge to the process of luring a trout to the line.</p><p>The 28th of some 50 suggestions on the memo, <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/11/mode/2up?q=%22not+a+very+nice+one%22" target="_blank">labeled</a> “not a very nice one,” was lifted from a 1937 detective novel by former intelligence officer Basil Thomson. In <em>The Milliner’s Hat Mystery</em>, a dead man is found with forged documents that obscure his true identity. As the Trout Memo explained, “a corpse dressed as an airman, with dispatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast” of Europe, where the faulty intel would hopefully land in German hands.</p><p>What began as the memo’s most far-fetched idea would in time become an operation that fooled the biggest fish of all—<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> himself—and bolstered the pivotal Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zwkSyrN0mvY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Historian Ben Macintyre chronicled the whole story in his 2010 book <a href="https://benmacintyre.com/us/book/operation-mincemeat/" target="_blank"><em>Operation Mincemeat</em></a>, which is the basis for Netflix’s new film of the same name. Read on for the riveting real history of the scheme and the plucky team that pulled it off.</p><p><em>Warning: Mild spoilers ahead for Netflix&#39;s </em>Operation Mincemeat<em>.

		<p>By early 1943, Britain was wrapping up its <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/North-Africa-campaigns" target="_blank">North African campaigns</a> and setting its sights on the Mediterranean, aiming to neutralize Italy. At the <a href="https://history.state.gov/milestones/1937-1945/casablanca" target="_blank">Casablanca Conference</a> in January, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/635842/winston-churchill-facts">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/639554/franklin-delano-roosevelt-facts">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> agreed that the best entry point would be Sicily. Unfortunately, this was so obvious that Germany and Italy would very likely flood the island with troops and be there to greet Allied forces with open arms.</p><p>Rather than charting a less ideal course, the Allies instead decided to try duping Germany into thinking they were actually plotting to invade Greece and Sardinia. A deception of this magnitude more or less involved throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what would stick. Under the codename “<a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/39/mode/2up?q=%22twelfth+army%22" target="_blank">Operation Barclay</a>,” British intelligence units hired Greek interpreters, stocked up on Greek money, developed the completely fake Twelfth Army to “station” near Greece, and more—all while keeping German spies abreast of the activity.</p><p>Operation Mincemeat loosely fell under Barclay’s umbrella, too, though it wasn’t specific to the Sicilian invasion when Charles Cholmondeley (played by <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/643603/succession-hbo-tv-show-facts"><em>Succession</em></a><em> </em>star Matthew Macfadyen) first <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/17/mode/2up?q=%22october+31%2C+1942%22" target="_blank">suggested</a> it back in October 1942. Cholmondeley was a tall, ungainly 25-year-old with a spectacular mustache and a brother who perished at <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/502995/5-surprising-facts-about-battle-dunkirk">Dunkirk</a>. Originally a Royal Air Force lieutenant whose poor vision kept him from piloting, by this time in the war Cholmondeley was an MI5 agent and secretary of the Twenty Committee—a cross-section of military and intelligence representatives responsible for monitoring double agents. (It wasn’t named for its number of members, but <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/17/mode/2up?q=%22double+cross%22" target="_blank">because</a> the Roman numeral for 20 is XX: a play on the ‘double-cross’ nature of the group.)</p><p>So it was to the Twenty Committee that Cholmondeley detailed what he’d come across in the Trout Memo and developed as his own “Operation Trojan Horse.” He may also have drawn inspiration from a recent incident in which real Allied officers had crashed off the Spanish coast, and certain intel recovered from one body got passed along to the Nazis.</p>

		<p>Committee leader John Masterman—another novel-writing operative—authorized Cholmondeley to continue with the curious enterprise and appointed Montagu as his co-leader. Montagu was a 42-year-old career barrister who sat on the committee as a representative from the Naval Intelligence Division, where he’d spent the war serving under Godfrey. (Decades later, Montagu would <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/83/mode/2up?q=%22the+world%27s+prize+shit%22" target="_blank">describe</a> his boss as “the world’s prize sh*t, but a genius.”)</p><p>And with that, the hunt for the perfect corpse was on.</p><h2>Corpse Guide</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>As their fallen airman would surely be autopsied upon discovery, Montagu <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/41/mode/2up?q=%22bernard+spilsbury%22" target="_blank">consulted</a> with famed forensic pathologist Bernard Spilsbury on what causes of death beyond drowning were believable. Spilsbury reassured him that plane crashes can kill people any number of ways—even just by shock. Montagu then <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/45/mode/2up?q=%22bentley+purchase%22" target="_blank">called</a> upon an old chum with access to all manner of bodies: St. Pancras Hospital coroner Bentley Purchase.</p><p>Purchase started keeping an eye out for a suitable corpse, and when 34-year-old Glyndwr Michael <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/53/mode/2up?q=%22january+28%22" target="_blank">passed away</a> at St. Pancras on January 28, he notified Montagu almost immediately. Michael, originally from Wales, had been discovered on the brink of death in an empty warehouse two days prior. He’d consumed rat poison, either purposely or because it happened to be on food scraps he’d eaten. Spilsbury and Purchase agreed that the poison would almost certainly go undetected during an autopsy performed after the body had spent a lengthy stint in water. </p><p>Furthermore, Michael, who had a history of being hospitalized due to mental illness, seemed to lack permanent housing or any family or friends that might come looking for him. (He did, in fact, have a <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/55/mode/2up?q=%22two+siblings%22" target="_blank">handful</a> of siblings, but the Mincemeat masterminds failed to track them down at the time. Unlike in the film, there’s no evidence that a sister showed up to claim his body mid-mission.)</p><p>Purchase made another vital contribution to the operation: a timeline. Fully freezing the corpse would raise red flags during an autopsy, so Montagu and Cholmondeley only had about three months to implement the plan before decay progressed too far.</p><p>But first, they’d have to replace <em>Trojan Horse</em> with something from the list of military-approved operation titles. Montagu found <em>Mincemeat</em> too apropos to pass up. “My sense of humor having by this time become somewhat macabre, the word seemed to be one of good omen,” he <a href="https://archive.org/details/manwhoneverwas00mont/page/16/mode/2up?q=%22macabre%22" target="_blank">wrote</a> in his 1953 book <em>The Man Who Never Was</em>.</p><p>On February 4, the partners <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/59/mode/2up?q=%22february+4%22" target="_blank">submitted</a> an official proposal to the Twenty Committee. Operation Mincemeat, it explained, could be used to convince Germany that Sicily was merely a cover for an actual attack planned for Greece—rather than the other way around. The committee then gave them the green light and promptly began securing support from all the important parties the project would involve. The War Office, for one, would need to issue false identification papers; and the Admiralty would need to scout out a coastal spot to plant the body.</p><p>Over the next couple months, Glyndwr Michael disappeared completely—and Major William “Bill” Martin of the Royal Marines materialized out of thin air.</p><h2>The Pam to Their Bill</h2>

		<p>A William Martin of the Royal Marines already existed, and not by coincidence. Montagu and Cholmondeley had chosen the name in case German officers bothered to check it against a Royal Marines roster. The real Martin was well off the radar, training U.S. pilots in Rhode Island.</p><p>But convincing Germany that Major Martin wasn’t a ruse would take more than a strategic moniker. For one thing, they needed a picture of Martin for his ID—and the pallor of Michael’s corpse looked a little too waxen in photographs, to put it kindly. After weeks of ogling every passerby for a resemblance to Michael, Montagu <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/135/mode/2up?q=%22ronnie+reed%22" target="_blank">happened</a> to end up in a meeting with Ronnie Reed, a BBC radio engineer moonlighting for MI5. With a few small tweaks, Reed could have passed for Michael in real life, and he consented to be photographed for the ID card. To make sure Martin’s uniform didn’t seem too new, Cholmondeley, whose stature and build were similar to Michael’s, took to wearing it around.</p><p>Joan Saunders, who worked for Montagu in the NID, <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/73/mode/2up?q=%22joan+saunders%22" target="_blank">recommended</a> dreaming up a sweetheart for the ill-fated Marine. So Montagu put out a call to the young ladies of the office to fork over photos of themselves that might make for a suitable “Pam.” He personally extended an invitation to <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/75/mode/2up?q=%22jean+leslie%22" target="_blank">Jean Leslie</a>, a comely 20-year-old in the MI5 secretarial unit. While Leslie’s silver-screen counterpart, portrayed by Kelly Macdonald, is a widow, she herself was not; the photo she submitted was snapped on a date just weeks earlier.</p>

		<p>Not only did Montagu choose her photograph for the mission, but the two leaned so far into their roles as Bill and Pam that the bond did turn into a true (if possibly chaste) courtship. Montagu wrote her many letters from “Bill,” and they socialized often outside the office. Montagu didn’t hide this in letters to his wife, Iris, who was sheltering in the U.S. with their two children. (Both husband and wife had Jewish backgrounds, so escaping across the pond seemed most prudent.)</p><p>“I took a girl from the office to Hungaria [a restaurant] and had dinner and danced. She is an attractive child,” he <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/77/mode/2up?q=%22i+took+a+girl%22" target="_blank">said</a> in one letter, the first of many in which Leslie is mentioned (though not explicitly by name). </p><p>Montagu’s fondness for Leslie doesn’t appear to have blossomed from a dearth of spousal love. He filled his letters to Iris with earnest, sentimental declarations <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/47/mode/2up?q=%22i+miss+you+most+frightfully%22" target="_blank">such as</a> “I miss you most frightfully” and “How ultra-happy our life was before this bloody business started …  Bugger Hitler.” It also doesn’t seem to have caused any tension between him and Cholmondeley, who rather ineffectively competes for Leslie’s affections in the movie.</p><p><em>Operation Mincemeat</em> filmmakers invoked creative license for another source of conflict between Montagu and Cholmondeley as well. Montagu’s brother Ivor actually did aid Russian communists for years, even befriending <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67533/gruesome-assassination-leon-trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a> himself. But while MI5 tracked Ivor’s activity extensively, Cholmondeley <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/movies/operation-mincemeat-true-story/" target="_blank">isn’t known</a> to have been tasked with investigating Ewen while they collaborated on Operation Mincemeat.</p><h2>Body of Lies</h2>

		<p>The Mincemeat team spent much of their time inventing a rich backstory for Martin that would inform what “wallet litter” they’d fill his pockets with. They decided he’d be a good-time guy and a bit of a spendthrift from a relatively well-off Roman Catholic family in Wales. He liked to fish, frequented the theater, and had a niece <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/71/mode/2up?q=%22priscilla%22" target="_blank">named</a> Priscilla. On his person they <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/331/mode/2up?q=%22cabaret+club%22" target="_blank">planted</a> a St. Christopher’s medal and a cross necklace, a stamp booklet, an invitation to the Cabaret Club, a pack of cigarettes, and a letter from his stiff-upper-lipped father, among other effects. There were also emblems of his relationship with Pam: a love letter (<a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/77/mode/2up?q=%22hester+leggett%22" target="_blank">written</a> by Leslie’s boss, Hester Leggett), the photograph, and a bill for an engagement ring.</p><p>And then came the pièce de résistance: a <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/97/mode/2up?q=%22nye%22" target="_blank">missive</a> from General Archibald Nye to General Harold Alexander, who was working under General Dwight D. Eisenhower’s command in Tunisia. It would be a personal letter—as opposed to an official dispatch—that casually mentioned the Sicily decoy plot and planned invasion of Greece. </p><p>In the film, an exasperated Montagu produces many drafts that are endlessly nitpicked by Godfrey, portrayed as Mincemeat’s main overseer. In reality, Commodore Edmund Rushbrooke <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/83/mode/2up?q=%22edmund+rushbrooke%22" target="_blank">replaced</a> Godfrey as NID’s director mid-operation; and it was actually Colonel <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/115/mode/2up?q=%22johnnie+bevan%22" target="_blank">Johnnie Bevan</a>, head of the London Controlling Section, an ultra-secret deception agency, who gave Montagu grief over his syntax. The end result, however, was the same: Montagu eventually just asked Nye to write the letter himself, which he did.</p>

		<p>On the advice of Britain’s Madrid-based naval attaché Salvador Augustus Gómez-Beare, Montagu and Cholmondeley decided to deposit Martin off the coast of Huelva, a fishing city in southwestern Spain with a heavy German influence. Cholmondeley scrapped the plan to drop the body from a plane in favor of a submarine launch, which would guarantee that it remained intact. To safeguard the corpse during the journey from Britain, he <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/111/mode/2up?q=%22fraser-smith%22" target="_blank">commissioned</a> engineer Charles Fraser-Smith—widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/13/world/charles-fraser-smith-mr-gadget-for-james-bond-tales-dies-at-88.html" target="_blank">inspiration</a> for Q in Fleming’s Bond novels—to design an airtight steel coffin filled with dry ice.</p><p>“All the details are now ‘buttoned up,’” Montagu <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/115/mode/2up?q=%22all+the+details+are+now%22" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a March 26 letter to Bevan, who soon got the final go-ahead from both Churchill and Eisenhower. Montagu and Cholmondeley then accompanied Major William Martin to Scotland, where, on April 19, he shipped out on the HMS <em>Seraph</em>.</p><h2>Read Letter Day</h2>

		<p>The crew of the <em>Seraph</em> <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/189/mode/2up?q=%22april+30%22" target="_blank">released</a> Martin into the ocean before sunrise on April 30. Later that very morning, Spanish fishermen hauled him in and turned him over to the authorities. Luckily, the local coroner, possibly influenced by the worsening of Martin’s stench as the day grew hotter, concluded that he’d died by drowning without too lengthy an examination.</p><p>Making sure the area’s German spies intercepted Nye’s letter—along with a couple other fake dispatches in Martin’s briefcase—wasn’t quite so simple. Martin’s belongings had been given to the Spanish Navy, which was much more committed to due diligence than certain German-leaning local officials. To encourage Nazis to actually seek out the letters, Montagu and Cholmondeley initiated a back-and-forth with Captain Alan Hillgarth, a British naval attaché in Madrid (and one of many possible inspirations for <a href="https://www.theolivepress.es/spain-news/2016/06/05/one-of-fictions-most-famous-heroes-was-inspired-by-the-iconic-expat-and-british-spy-alan-hillgarth/" target="_blank">James Bond</a>), explaining that Martin’s briefcase harbored highly sensitive intel that should be returned immediately. They suspected that Nazis would be monitoring the cables, and they were right.</p><p>The Abwehr, Germany’s intelligence organization, grew increasingly desperate to obtain the briefcase. But it still took nearly 10 days for it to end up in the lap of a Spanish official in Madrid who let the Germans photocopy its contents. From there, things escalated quickly. </p><p>Alexis von Roenne, the head of Nazi intelligence agency Fremde Heere West (Foreign Armies West), <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/231/mode/2up?q=%22the+circumstances+of+the+discovery%22" target="_blank">penned</a> a report contending that “The circumstances of the discovery, together with the form and contents of the dispatches, are absolutely convincing proof of the reliability of the letters.” Historians sometimes cite von Roenne’s failure to exercise more skepticism here as a sign that he may have secretly been working against the Nazis; he was, after all, later <a href="https://www.gdw-berlin.de/en/recess/biographies/index_of_persons/biographie/view-bio/alexis-freiherr-von-roenne/?no_cache=1" target="_blank">executed</a> for knowing about the July 1944 conspiracy to assassinate Hitler (which von Roenne approved of). Sincere or not, his confident affirmation likely helped sway Hitler—who wholeheartedly trusted him—toward accepting the letters as genuine. </p>

		<p>Throughout May, British intelligence received several indications that Hitler and all his highest-ranking cronies believed the Allies would target Greece and Sardinia and were mounting a resistance. Montagu and Cholmondeley, meanwhile, received Martin’s briefcase back from the Spanish Navy. While the letters’ seals hadn’t been broken, analysts confirmed that the envelope flaps had been <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/221/mode/2up?q=%22later+worked+out+exactly+how%22" target="_blank">opened</a> just enough to insert a thin rod, wrap the letter around it, and extract it through the opening. An eyelash <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/245/mode/2up?q=%22eyelash%22" target="_blank">placed</a> in one of the folded letters was also missing.</p><p>At that point, Operation Mincemeat had pretty much accomplished what it had intended. Only time would tell if the invasion of Sicily—codenamed Operation Husky—would, too.</p><h2>Outsmarted and Outplanned</h2>

		<p>Before daybreak on July 10, British, American, and Canadian troops began <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/invasion-of-sicily" target="_blank">landing</a> in droves on Sicily’s southern coast. Germany had just two units stationed on the island at the time. Even with the reinforcements that eventually arrived—not to mention Italy’s own forces—the Axis powers proved no match for the Allies’ some 150,000 soldiers, 3000 ships, and 4000 aircraft. By mid-August, the Allies had overtaken the entire island, while the Germans and Italians had retreated to mainland Italy.</p><p>Operation Husky <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/allies-land-on-sicily" target="_blank">spelled</a> the end for Italy’s Axis status. Just two weeks into the invasion, Benito Mussolini’s regime came tumbling down, and the new government started discussing peace terms with the Allies. On September 8, Italy formally <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/italian-surrender-is-announced" target="_blank">surrendered</a> (though the subsequent German invasion prevented the country from experiencing actual peace).</p><p>It’s impossible to know how these events would have unfolded if not for Operation Mincemeat. For one thing, it wasn’t the only deception tactic used to direct the Nazi gaze away from Italy. And Hitler’s fear of <a href="https://archive.org/details/operationminceme00maci/page/251/mode/2up?q=%22if+we+lost+the+balkans%22" target="_blank">losing</a> the Balkans—which provided crucial wartime resources to Germany—meant he was already actively worried about the Allies invading that region by way of Greece. At the very least, however, Operation Mincemeat helped edge Hitler into committing to a course of action he’d already favored, and it’s often mentioned as a key factor in the success of Operation Husky.</p><p>Operation Mincemeat<em> is streaming on Netflix now.</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/operation-mincemeat-deceiving-hitler-plot-true-story?utm_source=RSS">The True Story Behind ‘Operation Mincemeat’: How Hitler Fell for Britain’s Most Daring—And Disgusting—Deception</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>During the <a href="https://www.countryliving.com/uk/news/a36604880/extra-bank-holiday-in-2022-queen-platinum-jubilee/" target="_blank">first weekend in June</a>, the United Kingdom will be celebrating a historic first: a Platinum Jubilee for its <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/644240/longest-reigning-monarchs">long-reigning queen</a>. Queen Elizabeth II has held the throne for 70 years, more time than any monarch in the nation&#39;s history. Her decades in the spotlight have made her recognizable far beyond her home country. But even if you&#39;re familiar with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/633972/why-queen-elizabeth-wears-bright-colors">the queen&#39;s iconic look</a>, you may have trouble spotting the illustrated version of her in the brainteaser below. </p>

		<p>The London-based printing company <a href="https://www.iconprinting.com/blog/london-tourism-how-to-create-the-best-merch-for-your-attraction-2" target="_blank">ICON Printing</a> put together this hidden image search ahead of the queen&#39;s Platinum Jubilee next month. It shows the UK capital&#39;s top landmarks, including Big Ben, Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. </p><p>Tucked in the streets of London is the city&#39;s most famous resident. According to ICON Printing, the record for finding <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/94258/25-regal-facts-about-queen-elizabeth-ii">the queen</a> is 72 seconds. Take a look at the image above and see if you can beat that time. </p><p>The hidden image in this puzzle is elusive, much like the queen in real life (at least since she <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/queen-entering-new-phase-reign-25455443" target="_blank">entered her new phase</a>). If you&#39;ve been searching for a few minutes without luck, you can check the solution in the picture below. Here are some memorable moments from <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/655117/british-royal-jubilee-moments">royal jubilees past</a> to get you excited for the event in June. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you undertook a journey to the center of the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/647722/earth-facts">Earth</a> in the manner of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/546405/facts-about-jules-verne">Jules Verne’s</a> classic <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/science-fiction">sci-fi</a> novel, you wouldn’t come upon a herd of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/573995/thomas-jefferson-mastodon-obsession-fueled-lewis-and-clark-expedition">mastodons</a> or a hidden sea where the plesiosaur swims free. What you would come upon would be temperatures so high and pressure so intense that you’d die long before you reached your goal: In fact, the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190503-the-deepest-hole-we-have-ever-dug" target="_blank">deepest</a> we’ve ever drilled into Earth is only about 7.6 miles.</p><p>But thanks in large part to seismic waves <a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/curriculum-collections/earth-inside-and-out/inge-lehmann-discoverer-of-the-earth-s-inner-core" target="_blank">transmitted</a> during <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/627096/earthquake-facts">earthquakes</a>, scientists have been able to map out Earth’s unexplored interior. The planet is divided into four layers: the crust, mantle, outer core, and inner core. The top layer—the <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/planets/earth/in-depth/#otp_structure" target="_blank">crust</a>—is the thinnest, averaging roughly 19 miles thick beneath land and only around 3 miles thick beneath the ocean. That said, it can <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent/planet-earth/how-has-the-earth-evolved/the-earth-s-crust" target="_blank">reach</a> nearly 50 miles deep on land in some spots.</p><p>The lowest parts of the crust combine with the topmost layer of the upper <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/mantle" target="_blank">mantle</a> to form what’s known as the lithosphere, where tectonic plates are found. Under that is the mantle’s asthenosphere, then the lower mantle, and then another combination layer between the lower mantle and outer core that scientists call D” (pronounced “D double-prime”). Altogether, the mantle is Earth’s thickest layer, with an average radius of around 1800 miles—though, again, this varies by location. </p>

			</figure>
		<p>The mantle comprises mostly solid rock, and most of those rocks are silicon-oxygen compounds known as silicates. Olivine and garnet are a couple major players in that category. Non-silicate elements include iron, potassium, calcium, and more. It’s also extremely hot in the mantle, with temperatures ranging from around 1830°F to nearly 6700°F. </p><p>Below the mantle is the roughly 1370-mile-thick outer <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/core/" target="_blank">core</a>, consisting primarily of liquid nickel and iron. And, finally, the inner core: a sphere of solid iron (among other things) with a radius of nearly 760 miles. At over 9300°F, the inner core is definitely hot enough to melt that iron—but it doesn’t. Scientists think the pressure bearing down on the core from all the layers above it (and the atmosphere) may be keeping the iron in solid form.</p><p>If you add up the mileage of both the inner and outer core, it’s technically more than that of the mantle. But since the two are typically considered separate layers, the mantle is most often cited as the Earth’s thickest slice.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/what-is-thickest-layer-of-earth?utm_source=RSS">What’s the Thickest (And Thinnest) Layer of the Earth?</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The sad reality of heading back into the office or going away on vacation is that we usually have to leave our <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/pets">pets</a> behind at home. Instead of getting a sitter to come by and feed your animals while you’re away, an automatic feeder can do that for you on a set schedule without any hassle. And you’re in luck, because now one of Amazon’s bestselling automatic feeders is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PETLIBRO-Automatic-Dispenser-Desiccant-Recorder/dp/B0854HDNHN?tag=mf-petlibro-automatic-pet-feeder-20" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">on sale</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PETLIBRO-Automatic-Dispenser-Desiccant-Recorder/dp/B0854HDNHN?tag=mf-petlibro-automatic-pet-feeder-20" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Petlibro automatic pet feeder</a> comes in two sizes and color combinations, some of which you can get for a discount. Originally $80, the 4-liter option is currently marked down in black, so it&#39;ll cost $59, saving you 26 percent (you can get it in white for $70). The 6-liter version, also initially priced at $80, is on sale for $76 in white, saving you $4. </p>

		<p>Though the Amazon page says the Petlibro device is a “cat feeder,” you can easily use it for dogs as well. The brand says that the 4-liter food tank can store up to 10 days&#39; worth of food for a 22-pound dog and up to 25 days&#39; worth of food for a 12-pound cat. If you opt for the larger 6-liter tank, the amount of food increases (up to 20 days for dog food and 35 days for cat food for pets of comparable size). There’s also an included desiccant bag to keep the food inside the tank fresh, but you’ll need to change it every two weeks.</p><p>One of the gadget’s best features is that it lets you schedule your pet’s feedings via a light-emitting diode (LED) screen. You can program up to four meals per day and choose from nine portion control settings through this display. Additionally, you can record 10-second voice messages through the front panel for your four-legged friend to hear when it’s time to eat. Besides the food tank, the device has a 2-inch deep stainless steel food tray for your furry companion to eat from. You set the machine up by plugging it into a wall outlet, but you can also add batteries to it, which will ensure your pet won’t go hungry if the power suddenly fails.</p><p>Get your Petlibro automatic pet feeder on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PETLIBRO-Automatic-Dispenser-Desiccant-Recorder/dp/B0854HDNHN?tag=mf-petlibro-automatic-pet-feeder-20" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a> before this deal disappears.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/petlibro-automatic-feeder-amazon-deal?utm_source=RSS">Schedule Your Pet’s Meals With This Top-Rated Automatic Feeder That’s On Sale</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Judging the merits of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/television">television</a> shows is a highly subjective business. But sometimes a series is <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653010/best-tv-shows-21st-century-bbc-culture">just so good</a> that it doesn’t really seem up for debate—classics like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61919/23-things-you-might-not-know-about-wire"><em>The Wire</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/626243/fleabag-tv-show-facts"><em>Fleabag</em></a>, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66049/25-yada-yada-yada-facts-about-seinfeld"><em>Seinfeld</em></a>, and so on. Anyone even moderately plugged into pop culture probably doesn’t need to be reminded roughly when these shows were on the air or who starred in them. </p><p>But for every sitcom or prestige drama that made it big, there are handfuls of others that faded into obscurity practically while they were still on TV. Maybe the marketing budget was too small to make an impact or the network chose to kill a show before it found its niche. Or maybe it was just <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/one-of-the-boys-worst-tv-show-ever">a really bad show</a>.</p><p>Below are 50 TV series whose Tomatometer critic scores are all 0 percent. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the show itself was universally hated. If a program gets a 0 percent on <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/648843/rotten-tomatoes-facts">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, it <a href="https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/rotten-tomatoes-ratings-system/" target="_blank">means</a> 0 percent of critics gave it a positive review—and most of these shows have fewer than 10 reviews in total. </p><p>There are also several entries whose audience scores far <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/624192/most-divisive-movies-of-all-time">outperformed the critic scores</a>. The 2016 Syfy drama <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/hunters/s01" target="_blank"><em>Hunters</em></a>, for instance, earned a 59 percent from regular viewers. Not quite high enough to clear the threshold needed to achieve a full popcorn bucket on Rotten Tomatoes’s site—60 percent—but not abysmal. </p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8SV2bDaVfCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Others <em>did</em> clear that threshold. Not a single one of the 10 critics who appraised season 1 of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/miami-medical/s01" target="_blank"><em>Miami Medical</em></a> gave it a positive rating; but since all nine user ratings were positive, its audience score is an impressive 100 percent. The situation with Rob Schneider’s autobiographical sitcom <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/real_rob/s01" target="_blank"><em>Real Rob</em></a> is similar: 0 percent of eight critics submitted a positive rating, but 80 percent of 116 regular viewers did.</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LDnnJ1RO9ic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>All that said, if you’re looking to indulge in some of the worst TV ever to grace the small screen, this list is a stellar place to start. There are extremely specific reality shows (such as the U.S. version of <em>Farmer Wants a Wife</em>, which needs no explanation), movie spin-offs that crashed and burned (see <em>My Big Fat Greek Life</em>), and so much more.</p><p>Scroll on for the bottom 50, and check out Rotten Tomatoes’ full list <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/browse/tv_series_browse/sort:critic_lowest?page=1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><ol><li><em>Baby Talk</em> (1991-1992)</li><li><em>Real Rob</em> (2015-2017)</li><li><em>Work It</em> (2012-2013)</li><li><em>The Michael Richards Show</em> (2000)</li><li><em>Charlie&#39;s Angels</em> (2011)</li><li><em>The Family Man</em> (1990-1991)</li><li><em>The Alec Baldwin Show</em> (2018)</li><li><em>Work With Me</em> (1999-2000)</li><li><em>Dads</em> (2013)</li><li><em>Hunters</em> (2016)</li><li><em>Dellaventura</em> (1997-1998)</li><li><em>Miami Medical</em> (2010)</li><li><em>My Big Fat Greek Life</em> (2003)</li><li><em>Hit the Road</em> (2017)</li><li><em>Living With Fran</em> (2005-2007)</li><li><em>Uncle Buck</em> (1990)</li><li><em>100 Questions</em> (2010)</li><li><em>Ask Harriet</em> (1998)</li><li><em>South of Hell</em> (2015)</li><li><em>Going Places</em> (1990)</li><li><em>Laurie Hill</em> (1992)</li><li><em>Secret Agent Man</em> (2000)</li><li><em>The Chevy Chase Show</em> (1993)</li><li><em>Tucker</em> (2000-2001)</li><li><em>Charlie Hoover</em> (1991)</li><li><em>E.A.R.T.H.

        <![CDATA[<p>Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs, have been fascinating humanity since ancient times (though strange things in the sky weren&#39;t always referred to as UFOs, of course). From bizarre early sightings and the time the White House had a run-in with UFOs to the origin of the phrase <em>flying saucer</em> and the truth behind what happened at Roswell, New Mexico, here are UFO facts you need to know, adapted from an episode of The List Show on YouTube.</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLzDIWu4HRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>1. The term <em>UFO</em> was first used in the 1950s in reference to reports from the U.S. Air Force.</h2>

		<p>UFO stands for Unidentified Flying Object, a term that the Oxford English Dictionary says was <a href="https://www.lexico.com/explore/what-is-the-origin-of-the-term-ufo" target="_blank">coined in 1953</a> by writer Donald Keyhoe in an issue of <em>Air Line Pilot</em>. In the article, though, Keyhoe mostly uses the term in quotes from Air Technical Intelligence Center reports, which is part of the U.S. Air Force. In a document from the ‘50s, they defined a UFOB as “any airborne object which by performance, aerodynamic characteristics, or unusual features, does not conform to any presently known aircraft or missile type, or which cannot be positively identified as a familiar object.” Things that fall into the category of familiar objects include balloons, birds, and planets.</p><h2>2. More recent government reports use the term <em>UAP</em>, among other abbreviations.</h2><p>UFO isn’t the only acronym used to refer to these crafts. A recently released government report uses UAP, or Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon, amongst other creative abbreviations. </p><h2>3. The term <em>UFO</em> doesn’t refer to aliens, just the flying objects.</h2><p>Just because we call something a UFO doesn’t necessarily mean there are <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/626395/what-to-do-if-you-meet-an-alien">aliens</a> involved, although of course the two terms are associated in the public consciousness. But if you do want to talk about little green men and sound super official about it, you can call them ETBs, or <em>extraterrestrial beings</em>. There are also ETCs, or Extraterrestrial Crafts.</p><p>These terms, by the way, <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/Helpful-Links/NSA-FOIA/Frequently-Requested-Information/UFO-and-Other-Paranormal-Information/" target="_blank">come from an NSA list</a> of terms included in unsuccessful Freedom of Information Act requests. If you were curious, yes, people did want government documents containing the word <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86458/out-world-oral-history-alf"><em>ALF</em></a>. </p><h2>4. Foo Fighters took their name from an old term referring to UFO-like objects.</h2>

		<p>You know Foo Fighters as a totally badass rock band headed up by Dave Grohl, but the term dates back to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/world-war-two">World War II</a>. The word <em>foo</em> seemingly originated from <em>Smokey Stover</em>, a popular comic at the time; members of the 415th Night Fighter Squadron <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1b27CQlUsoAC&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Let%252520Us%252520Not%252520Forget%25253A%252520A%252520Tribute%252520to%252520America&#39;s%25252020th%252520Century%252520Veterans&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q=foo%252520fighter&amp;f=false" target="_blank">paired it</a> with the word <em>fighters</em> to describe the <a href="https://www.oed.com/view/Entry/259000?redirectedFrom=foo+fighters#eid" target="_blank">weird, annoying balls of light</a> they spotted in the air over Germany. Grohl was apparently reading a lot of books about UFOs at the time, and—take note, wannabe rock stars—he <a href="https://www.clashmusic.com/news/foo-fighters-on-their-band-name" target="_blank">has said</a> that “there&#39;s a treasure trove of band names in those UFO books!&#34;</p><h2>5. A misquoted pilot brought the term <em>flying saucer </em>into the public consciousness.</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>The phrase <em>flying saucer</em> has a pretty fascinating history. It seems to have gotten its big break after an incident that occurred on <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-man-who-introduced-the-world-to-flying-saucers/372732/" target="_blank">June 24, 1947</a>. Pilot Kenneth Arnold was flying near Mount Rainier looking for plane wreckage when he spotted nine metallic objects in the sky. They were huge—Arnold estimated they were each about the size of a DC-4 plane—and moving around 1200 mph. He thought they were military planes and reported them, at which point the press misquoted him as saying the objects were “flying saucers.” As Arnold recalled in an interview with legendary journalist Edward Murrow:</p><p><em>“These objects more or less fluttered like they were, oh, I&#39;d say, boats on very rough water or very rough air of some type, and when I described how they flew, I said that they flew like they take a saucer and throw it across the water. Most of the newspapers misunderstood and misquoted that too. They said that I [had] said that they were saucer-like; I said that they flew in a saucer-like fashion.”</em></p><p>The misquote took flight, you might say; <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufos-washington-white-house-air-force-coverup" target="_blank">in the weeks afterward</a>, flying saucers were spotted in 40 other states. And for a time, the phrase was basically shorthand for a UFO.</p><h2>6. <em>LIFE</em> magazine once wrote about UFOs.</h2><p>The article, which was called “<a href="http://www.project1947.com/shg/articles/lifemag52.html" target="_blank">Have We Visitors From Space</a>?,” appeared in an April 1952 issue of <em>LIFE</em> and featured 10 UFO cases that, in the opinion of one scientist quoted in the article, “have an out-of-world basis.” As evidence of their extraterrestrial origins, he cited things like the acceleration ability of the aircrafts and the fact that no human pilot could survive the maneuvers they pulled off.</p><h2>7. UFOs have been written about for centuries.</h2><p>Long before either Kenneth Arnold or <em>LIFE</em>, people were spotting UFOs in the skies—and either drawing them or writing about them. As Richard Stothers <a href="https://www-jstor-org.i.ezproxy.nypl.org/stable/30038660?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">put it</a> in a 2007 piece for <em>The Classical Journal</em>, “Throughout recorded history, reports of what we today might call unidentified flying objects have been made and preserved. If more information were available to us, we would perhaps find that conventional scientific hypotheses could explain most, if not all of these ... There nonetheless remains a small residue of puzzling accounts, and regardless of what interpretation one places on them, these constitute a phenomenon that spans centuries of time and widely different cultures.”</p><h2>8. Some ancient UFOs have natural explanations.</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>In that <em>Classical Journal </em>paper, Stothers focused on the Ancient Romans, who wrote about strange things in the sky all the time. Some of them can definitely be explained by natural phenomena, like eclipses or meteor showers. Others, not so much. </p><h2>9. Other ancient UFO sightings are harder to explain.</h2><p>In 74 BCE, thousands of people witnessed a strange event in which, as Plutarch wrote around 150 years later, “a huge, flame-like body,” silver in color and shaped like a wine jar, interrupted two warring armies. Pliny the Elder wrote that “a spark was seen to fall from a star and to grow as it approached the earth.” It eventually became as large as the Moon before going back into the sky. And in the 200s BCE, there were reports of things like “a spectacle of ships” and “round shields” seen in the sky. </p><h2>10. An apparent UFO battle was reported in 16th-century Europe.</h2><p>Things don’t get any less weird when you fast forward to the 1560s, when people living in Germany and Switzerland <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=5wD5hS03NkgC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">reported</a> seeing strangely shaped objects doing aerial battle and flying around.</p><h2>11. People in America started reporting UFO sightings as early as the 17th century. </h2>

		<p>The first written record of UFOs in what eventually became the United States comes from the 1630s, when some men who were out on Boston’s Muddy River at night reported seeing a light in the sky. <a href="https://newengland.com/today/living/new-england-history/ufo-sightings-alien-sightings/" target="_blank">In the words</a> of Governor John Winthrop, who recorded the incident, “when [the light] stood still, it flamed up, and was about three yards square; when it ran, it was contracted into the figure of a swine: it ran as swift as an arrow towards Charlton [Charlestown], and so up and down about two or three hours.” </p><p>Even stranger, by the time the incident was over, the boat the men were in had somehow moved a mile upstream—and they weren’t sure how that had happened. </p><h2>12. The U.S. Air Force began investigating UFOs after World War II.</h2><p>After World War II, modern UFO research really ramped up. Sightings of weird things in the sky spiked, and the government responded by having the U.S. Air Force investigate the incidents. The Air Force formed the first of several task forces, Project Sign, in 1948. It was <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/unidentified-flying-object" target="_blank">quickly succeeded</a> by Project Grudge, which itself was superseded by the most famous UFO inquiry, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/571380/project-blue-book-facts-government-ufo-program">Project Blue Book</a>, in the early 1950s.</p><h2>13. The most famous UFO incident of all time occurred near Roswell, New Mexico. </h2>

		<p>At some point in the <a href="https://www.space.com/what-is-the-truth-behind-the-roswell-ufo-incident" target="_blank">summer of 1947</a>, something crashed on a ranch outside of Roswell. The rancher who discovered the debris said it was “bright wreckage made up of rubber strips, tinfoil, a rather tough paper and sticks.” In early July, he delivered some of the debris to the sheriff, who called in the big guns: the military. Men based at the Roswell Army Air Field went out to collect the rest of the debris, and soon, their press representative released a statement, which said:</p><p><em>&#34;The many rumors regarding the flying disc became a reality yesterday when the intelligence office of the 509th Bomb Group of the Eighth Air Force, Roswell Army Air Field, was fortunate enough to gain possession of a disk through the cooperation of one of the local ranchers and the sheriff’s office of Chaves County.&#34; </em></p><h2>14. The Roswell incident sent the country into UFO-mania.</h2><p>The statement made news around the country, even as the Army was backpedaling. As Dick Pearce at the <em>San Francisco Examiner</em> <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/458820175/?terms=%25252525252522roswell%25252525252522%2525252525252B%25252525252522weather%2525252525252Bballoon%25252525252522" target="_blank">reported</a> on July 9, 1947, he called General George Ramey at a base in Fort Worth, Texas, who described the disc and noted his belief that it was a piece of a weather balloon, saying, “There is no such gadget (as the disc) known to the Army—at least this far down the line.”  </p><p>Pearce described the initial statement as “the boner of” the Army’s public relations official and wrote that the debris was actually “the box kite radar reflector of a weather balloon,” noting, “while the mistake lasted, it was a honey.”</p><h2>15. The debris in Roswell was most likely from a government spying operation.</h2><p>For a while, that was that—<a href="https://www.space.com/ufos-uap-history-sightings-mysteries" target="_blank">until the 1970s</a>, when people who believed the government was covering something up started casting doubt on the official story. And in a way, they weren’t wrong. What crashed outside Roswell may not have been extraterrestrial in origin, but it <em>also</em> wasn’t a weather balloon—most likely, it was part of Project Mogul, which was an experimental project to acoustically spy on the Soviets.</p><h2>16. Project Blue Book used standardized questions to collect UFO data.</h2><p>To handle UFO sightings, Project Blue Book—which was was named after those little blue books students took college exams in—asked people to fill out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190109225734/https:/www.history.com/news/ufo-sighting-1950s-questionnaire-project-blue-book" target="_blank">standardized questions</a>, including “When did you see the object?” “Where were you when you saw the object?” “What was the condition of the sky?” and “If there was more than one object, then how many were there?” UFO spotters were also asked to draw what they had seen, describe what sound it made, and note if its edges were fuzzy, bright, or sharply outlined.</p><p>Project Blue Book was active until 1969 and in that time, according to Britannica, recorded 12,000 incidents which were either identified—as things like atmospheric phenomena or man-made objects like weather balloons—or “unidentified.” The unidentified incidents accounted for 6 percent of the cases recorded by Project Blue Book.</p><h2>17. The White House once had a close encounter with UFOs.</h2>

		<p>Not long before midnight on July 19, 1952, seven weird blips appeared on the radar of Washington National Airport, leading the man in the air traffic control tower to <a href="https://www.history.com/news/ufos-washington-white-house-air-force-coverup" target="_blank">crack a joke</a> about “a fleet of flying saucers.” Soon, air traffic controllers at Andrews Air Force base were also seeing strange blips moving at incredibly high speeds on their screens. But no one was laughing when those crafts, whatever they were, flew by the Capitol Building and the White House. </p><p>By the time interceptor jets were mobilized back on that day in July 1952, whatever craft had paid a visit to a snoozing <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/550874/facts-about-harry-s-truman">Harry S. Truman</a> had disappeared. But according to most versions of the story, when the planes left, the blips came back. When night ended, they left—and then came back again the following Saturday. Jets were called up again, but just when they would get to an area where the blips had been seen on radar, the blips would vanish from radar.</p><p>The incident was officially blamed on temperature inversion, an event in which—simplistically speaking—a layer of warm air traps cooler air underneath; radar signals bounce off the layer and appear to show objects that are actually near the ground in the sky. But the radar operators who saw the phenomenon, as well as the people behind Project Blue Book, didn’t accept that explanation, and what really happened remains unsolved to this day.</p><h2>18. Betty and Barney Hill claimed they were abducted in a UFO.</h2><p>Betty worked in child welfare, and Barney at the post office, and in September 1961, they spontaneously decided to take a vacation to give themselves a little R&amp;R. They took a three-day trip, driving from their home in New Hampshire to Niagara Falls and Montreal. On the way back, they were driving on dark, empty roads of New Hampshire’s White Mountains when they spotted a light in the sky that moved strangely—it <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/649683/betty-and-barney-hill-alien-abduction">moved upward</a> instead of falling like a shooting star would. It got bigger and bigger, and eventually seemed to be keeping track of their car as they drove. When they looked at it through binoculars, they could see that it was a <a href="https://www.history.com/news/first-alien-abduction-account-barney-betty-hill" target="_blank">spinning object</a>. </p><p>They kept driving, but eventually, Barney had had enough. He got out to confront the craft and saw grayish aliens inside with huge eyes. He felt like they were going to be abducted, so he ran back to the car and hit the gas. As they continued to drive, the Hills encountered some kind of roadblock and a fiery orb and passed out. </p><p>When they woke up a couple of hours later, they were 35 miles away from where they’d been with zero memory of how they’d gotten there. Their clothes and shoes were mussed, and their watches weren’t working. There were strange metal marks on the trunk of their car that made compasses go wild.</p><p>Understandably disturbed, the Hills filed a report with Project Blue Book and went to a psychiatrist, who <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2306tufos.html" target="_blank">used hypnosis</a> to help them remember what supposedly happened: Gray beings took them into a huge metallic craft, where they were separated and examined. The beings took samples of their hair, nails, and skin, and a needle was inserted into Betty’s abdomen. Finally, their memories were erased.</p><p>The Hills didn’t tell anyone about the incident until 1963. Ultimately, despite therapy, research, and getting the government involved, the Hills didn’t find out what had happened to them. Many have been skeptical of their accounts, of course, including a young <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64954/11-out-world-facts-about-carl-sagan">Carl Sagan</a>, who, in 1967, was a Harvard professor on a panel discussing the possible abduction. Project Blue Book officially filed their case under “insufficient data.”</p><h2>19. There are many, many things that can be mistaken for UFOs.</h2>

		<p>Venus, for example, is a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/641697/objects-mistaken-ufos">prime culprit</a> behind many supposed UFO sightings, probably because it’s so bright and so close to the horizon. SpaceX rocket launches have been mistaken for UFOs, and so has an Army parachute team. Drones and certain cloud formations also make the list. One UK resident actually called the police to report a bright object lingering near their home … which they later realized was the Moon. </p><h2>20. A report released in 2021 detailed UFO-related stories from government employees. </h2><p>The report, released by the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, or UAPTF, focused on 144 eyewitness reports of UAPs—unidentified aerial phenomena—reported by government employees, which occurred between 2004 and 2021.  </p><h2>21. Only one of the UAPs was properly identified. </h2><p>Of those 144 cases, the report <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/27/politics/ufos-uap-extraterrestrial-life/index.html" target="_blank">identified just one</a> with confidence: It was believed to be a very big balloon that was deflating. The rest remain unidentified.</p><h2> 22. A few interesting patterns emerged from the UAPTF reports. </h2><p>There were themes that emerged in the eyewitness accounts, including things like size, shape, and propulsion. There was also the fact that sightings often occurred around U.S. military testing grounds, but the report notes that that might be because of large numbers of high-quality sensors in those locations and because aviators there are both more focused and encouraged to report anomalies.   </p><p>In some of the incidents, witnesses reported UAPs that moved in unusual ways. According to the report, “Some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernible means of propulsion. In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings.”</p><h2>23. The UAPTF believes most of these incidents can be easily categorized. </h2><p>Does this mean aliens? Of course not, according to the task force. In fact, they think many of them will fall into a few explainable categories: airborne clutter (think things like that aforementioned balloon, birds, or drones); natural atmospheric phenomena (things like moisture and ice crystals);  USG or Industry Developmental Programs (a.k.a. classified aircraft); or foreign adversary systems (craft deployed by the likes of Russia or China).</p><p>All the rest end up in the “other” category.  And even then, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/politics/ufo-report-pentagon-odni/index.html" target="_blank">as one official said</a>, “we have no clear indications that there is any non-terrestrial explanation for them—but we will go wherever the data takes us.” These objects might have appeared to move strangely because of observer misperception or things like sensor errors.</p><h2>24. Reports of UFOs will continue to be collected for the foreseeable future. </h2><p>We don’t have an explanation for these sightings yet, and unfortunately, it might stay that way, thanks to things like insufficient data and limited reporting. That said, because these UAPs could pose a risk to military aircraft and national security, these reports will continue to be collected and studied. So the truth ... might still be out there.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/ufo-facts-history-sightings?utm_source=RSS">24 Fascinating Facts About UFOs</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>During the early days of cell phones, it seemed like designers focused heavily on trying to make the devices as small as possible and compact enough to fit in clutches and pockets. But they’re no longer just for calling and texting: You can work from your phone, shoot a movie on your phone, and so much more—and those capabilities often merit a larger screen.</p><p>The latest <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/623594/what-i-in-iphone-stands-for">iPhones</a> in particular are quite huge compared to the older models (unless you’re sticking to the Minis or the SE line). For people with larger-than-average hands, this is probably a welcome—or at least negligible—change. Gone are the days when your <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/564517/simple-iphone-cursor-hack-will-make-texting-easier">texts</a> are full of typos simply because your fingers are too big to consistently tap the right keys.</p><p>For those with small digits, however, the sizing-up trend means that operating your smartphone now often feels like a job for two hands. Using only one hand to simultaneously hold your iPhone and type out a message requires more balance and thumb stretching than you might want it to.</p><p>Luckily, as <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/08/how-to-set-up-and-use-one-handed-keyboard-on-iphone" target="_blank">AppleInsider reports</a>, there’s a way to change your keyboard settings to better suit single-handed use. Open the keyboard in any app, look for either the emoji icon or the globe icon, and hold it down until your keyboard menu pops up. At the bottom, you should see three keyboard icons. Choose the one on the left, and your keyboard will compress itself toward the left side, offering a smaller keyboard perfect for left-handers. Choose the one on the right, and it’ll shift toward the right. Press the arrow in the empty space, and it’ll return to its original orientation.</p><p>You can also change your default keyboard by going to Settings &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; One-Handed Keyboard. Select left or right, and that’s what your keyboard should look like across all apps unless you revert it back.</p><p><em>[h/t </em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/08/how-to-set-up-and-use-one-handed-keyboard-on-iphone" target="_blank"><em>AppleInsider</em></a><em>]</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/iphone-hack-one-handed-texting?utm_source=RSS">This iPhone Keyboard Hack Makes One-Handed Texting Much Easier</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Author Amy Tan’s <em>The Joy Luck Club,</em> published in 1989, was much different from other novels that were occupying the bestseller lists at the time. In <a href="https://ew.com/books/2019/04/26/amy-tan-joy-luck-club-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank">describing</a> the emotional connection between Chinese-Americans and their immigrant mothers who <a href="https://people.com/archive/the-joy-luck-club-has-brought-writer-amy-tan-a-bit-of-both-vol-31-no-14/" target="_blank">gather for games of mah-jongg</a> at a social club, Tan was shining a light on an under-represented culture. The book became a sensation, inspiring a 1993 movie and helping open doors for other depictions of Asian life in media. Here are some other facts about Tan’s influential work, as seen in Mental Floss&#39;s book <a href="https://insighteditions.com/pages/mentalflosslandingpage" target="_blank"><em>The Curious Reader</em></a>.</p><h2>1. Amy Tan didn’t originally aspire to be a novelist.</h2>

		<p>If lived experiences inform a writer’s best work, then Amy Tan has a deep reservoir to draw from. Before the age of 18, Tan had<a href="http://www.amytan.net/about.html" target="_blank"> lived</a> in 12 homes around the San Francisco area. At 15, her father John and brother Peter both succumbed to brain tumors, prompting her mother to take Tan and her younger brother John Jr. to travel Europe before Tan graduated from high school in Switzerland.</p><p>After stints at five different colleges, Tan emerged with degrees in English and linguistics and became a language development specialist before turning to freelance business writing. Becoming a novelist was the furthest thing from her mind, but Tan did have an interest in short fiction and attended a writer’s group led by Molly Giles, setting her on the path to becoming a full-time fiction writer.</p><h2>2. <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> was inspired in part by a trip to China.</h2><p>Tan, the daughter of immigrants, had never been to China prior to 1987. That year, the then-35-year-old <a href="https://achievement.org/achiever/amy-tan/" target="_blank">traveled</a> with her mother Daisy to visit the three daughters Daisy had been forced to leave behind after fleeing the communist country in 1949. The experience pushed Tan to complete a book of short stories about Chinese mothers and their Chinese-American daughters.</p><h2>3. <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> wasn’t originally written as a novel.</h2><p>Tan originally conceived <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> as a series of 16 vignettes about four pairs of mothers and daughters, effectively making it a short story collection. Tan said she was <a href="https://lithub.com/amy-tan-reflects-on-30-years-since-the-joy-luck-club/" target="_blank">inspired</a> by <em>Love Medicine</em> by Louise Erdich, which used a similar structure. But when one early review for the book <a href="https://ew.com/books/2019/04/26/amy-tan-joy-luck-club-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank">referred</a> to it as a novel, the publisher decided that was better from a marketing perspective and took “stories” off the title page. Tan still considers it a <a href="https://caamedia.org/blog/2019/04/17/amy-tan-reflects-on-the-book-and-film-anniversaries-for-the-joy-luck-club/" target="_blank">collection </a>of short stories.</p><h2>4. Most of <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> was written in just four months.</h2><p>After receiving positive feedback on three of the stories that would eventually be included in <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>, Tan decided to quit her job as a freelance business writer and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/19/books/the-joy-luck-club.html" target="_blank">devote</a> all her time to completing the book. The remaining 13 stories were written in just four months.</p><h2>5. <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> is—and isn’t—autobiographical.</h2><p>Because Tan has been so outspoken about her mother’s influence on <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>, many readers have come to assume it was autobiographical. This isn’t accurate, as the scenarios in the book aren’t based on Tan’s life. The author has instead <a href="https://ew.com/books/2019/04/26/amy-tan-joy-luck-club-30th-anniversary/" target="_blank">described</a> it as being emotionally accurate, with the themes and conflicts rooted in Tan’s real relationship with her mother—who wound up loving the book. “She loved that the feelings in [it] were absolutely true, and she believed that I had listened to her and that I appreciated what she was trying to teach me,” Tan told <em>Entertainment Weekly</em>. “And that was the best review I could have gotten for that book. It was the best, the absolute best that I got.”</p><h2>6. <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> is taught in high schools.</h2><p>Owing to its rich depiction of Chinese culture, Chinese history, and familial bonds, <em>The Joy Luck Club </em>is a popular title to <a href="https://www.prestwickhouse.com/blog/post/2016/05/how-to-teach-the-joy-luck-club" target="_blank">read</a> and review in classrooms. It’s sometimes used in tandem with the 1993 movie adaptation of the same name. “In the past, <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> was included on required reading lists because the stories were different from the mainstream and thus would give young readers exposure to another culture,” <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/300526/the-joy-luck-club-by-amy-tan/9780143129493/readers-guide/" target="_blank">Tan has said</a>. “Those were in the days when communities were not that diverse. The irony today is that educators select my book so that young readers can <em>identify</em> with the story. The student population is multicultural and the same books once selected to understand <em>others</em> are now chosen to understand <em>ourselves</em>.”</p><h2>7. The movie adaptation of <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> required careful planning.</h2><p>Hollywood <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1993/09/05/movies/how-to-tell-the-players-in-the-joy-luck-club.html" target="_blank">expressed an interest</a> in adapting <em>The Joy Luck Club </em>early on, and director Wayne Wang eventually assembled one of the few all-Asian-American casts of the era. (It wouldn’t be until 2018’s <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> that such a degree of representation appeared again in a major Hollywood release.) To tell the sprawling story of four mother-daughter pairings, the production had to cast 15 people in total—usually two and sometimes three actors needed to portray each character at different parts in their lives. (Ming-Na Wen, Tamlyn Tomita, Rosalind Chao, Lisa Lu, Lauren Tom, and Tsai Chin were <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/crazy-rich-asians-joy-luck-club-cast-executive/story?id=57201495" target="_blank">among</a> the principals.)</p><p>More than 2000 actors attended an open casting call in New York, a testament to how powerful the story’s themes spoke to an under-represented community. “There were a lot of real mothers and daughters who had read the book and felt it reflected their own experience,” Wang told <em>The New York Times</em> in 1993. “They came in to audition together … I felt there were at least 400<em> Joy Luck Club</em> stories in that room.”</p><h2>8. Amy Tan appeared on <em>The Simpsons</em>.</h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZHnufORDc24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>With the success of <em>The Joy Luck Club</em>, Tan became that rare novelist who has a high name recognition factor. In 2000, she <a href="https://observer.com/2009/01/updike-in-springfield-author-recalling-his-appearance-on-ithe-simpsonsi/" target="_blank">appeared</a> on<em> The Simpsons</em> in the episode “Insane Clown Poppy” alongside authors <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/22813/10-terrific-facts-about-stephen-king">Stephen King</a>, Tom Wolfe, and John Updike. In the scene, a cheerful Lisa Simpson<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHnufORDc24" target="_blank"> addresses</a> Tan at a personal appearance at a book fair by telling her she loved <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> and its mother-daughter lessons. “No, that’s not what I meant at all,” Tan responds. “You couldn’t have gotten it more wrong. Just sit down. I’m embarrassed for both of us.” Tan was, of course, parodying herself—the generational message of <em>The Joy Luck Club</em> is one Lisa and millions of readers understood immediately.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/joy-luck-club-book-facts?utm_source=RSS">8 Things You Might Not Know About 'The Joy Luck Club'</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>On April 28, 2022, Paramount+ premiered the first three episodes of </em><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/the-offer/">The Offer</a><em>, a limited series about the making of </em>The Godfather<em>, based on the experiences of the film&#39;s producer, Al Ruddy, who serves as an executive producer on the series, in which he&#39;s played by Miles Teller.  </em></p><p><em>From disagreements with uber-producer Robert Evans (Matthew Goode) and Paramount head Charles Bluhdorn (Burn Gorman) to dust-ups with real-life mobsters like Joe Colombo (Giovanni Ribisi), the 10-episode event recounts the behind-the-scenes drama that often rivaled what ended up on the screen. Here&#39;s the real story of what happened when the mob protested </em>The Godfather<em>.</em></p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iowLzO9-aew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Francis Ford Coppola was just a few months into production on <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62427/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-godfather"><em>The Godfather</em></a> when he began <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/03/godfather200903" target="_blank">directing the fictional assassinations</a> Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) orders against family rivals. On June 28, 1971, as a Corleone hitman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/22/mafia" target="_blank">aimed</a> his prop gun under Coppola’s direction, a very similar scene was taking place just four blocks away. Joe Colombo, a professed real estate agent who led the Italian-American Civil Rights League in protesting stereotyped depictions of Italians in film, was approaching a podium to make a speech during a rally at Columbus Circle in New York. He was oblivious to the very real gun being aimed at his head.</p><p>For months, Colombo had waged war against the Paramount movie, asserting it propagated an exaggerated fiction about the existence of the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/643971/operation-underworld-us-government-enlisted-mafia-help-world-war-ii">mafia</a>. Colombo had intimated there would be labor issues, production delays, and other, less defined obstacles that could threaten to curtail the studio’s multimillion investment in their adaption of Mario Puzo&#39;s 1969 novel. He could make such statements because, in addition to his real estate interests, Colombo was a major figure in organized crime.</p><p>Before Colombo could utter a word at the rally, a man disguised as a press photographer dropped his camera, raised a revolver, and shot Colombo three times in the head and neck. Colombo’s men immediately retaliated and shot the assassin dead.</p><p>For Paramount, any sense of relief would be short-lived. In making sure nothing interrupted filming of<em> The Godfather</em>, producers had made a very public—and very costly—pact with the mob.</p><h2>An Offer They Can&#39;t Refuse</h2>

		<p>When prodded by reporters, the outspoken Colombo would deny there was any such thing as a mafia.  “Mafia, what&#39;s a mafia?” he was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/06/29/archives/colombo-a-man-with-several-roles.html" target="_blank">once quoted</a> as saying. “There is not a mafia. Am I head of a family? Yes. My wife and four sons and a daughter. That&#39;s my family.”</p><p>A cursory investigation of Colombo’s past would reveal otherwise. After commandeering the Profaci crime family in the mid-1960s, and capitalizing on the void left by incarcerated boss &#34;Crazy&#34; Joe Gallo, Colombo quickly rose through the ranks of New York’s notorious Five Families. He had been indicted for <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AOMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22joe+colombo%22+and+%22tax+evasion%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J16wduEcaO&amp;sig=8Ad5CRrkKZ44sgOute0CU_BQe6A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwgeDE6p3TAhUBC8AKHasTC9AQ6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joe%20colombo%22%20and%20%22tax%20evasion%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">tax evasion</a> and accused by the FBI of running a widespread gambling and extortion ring.</p><p>Most suspected criminals would keep a low profile. Instead, Colombo decided to go big. He co-created the Italian-American Civil Rights League and decried sensational media stories regarding Italian-Americans in general. He found support in members of his ethnicity—nearly 45,000 members—who were tired of the stereotypes. An Alka-Seltzer commercial with the catchphrase “That’s-a-some-a-spicy meatball” was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/nyregion/anthony-colombo-dies-at-71-helped-get-mafia-out-of-the-godfather.html?_r=0" target="_blank">an early target</a>, and the League had success getting it removed from the airwaves. He also lobbied to have the word <em>mafia</em> taken out of scripts for television’s <em>The FBI</em>.</p><p>In rallying law-abiding Italians and depicting himself as the aggrieved party, Colombo was successful in helping to stifle reference to the terms <em>mafia</em> or <em>la cosa nostra</em> in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/pop-culture">popular culture</a>. As soon as Paramount announced plans to produce <em>The Godfather</em>, he had acquired his biggest target to date.</p><h2>From Bestseller to Blockbuster</h2>

		<p>The film version of the Puzo novel had been brought to the studio by producer Robert Evans, who had acquired Puzo’s treatment in 1968. Puzo, heavily in debt due to a gambling habit, was eager to have the book and film rights erase his ledger. He openly admitted his research into organized crime was limited to asking questions of dealers and players during card games in casinos.</p><p><em>The Godfather</em> sold 750,000 copies in hardcover and would go on to sell <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/03/20/archives/-godfather-film-wont-mention-mafia-protest-gets-mafia-reference-out.html" target="_blank">millions more</a> in paperback. Because of the book’s success, the adaptation was heavily publicized before a single frame had been shot. When Colombo got wind of it, he made it known that the production would not be welcome in New York locations if it insisted on embracing stereotypes—a clever misdirection that helped take some attention off his own criminal doings.</p><p>Although Colombo never took credit for it, the film’s producer, Al Ruddy, began experiencing a series of unsettling events that seemed connected to the League’s public protests. His car windows <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EA1SCEmDyBMC&amp;pg=PT302&amp;lpg=PT302&amp;dq=godfather+joe+colombo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KvP1zvbL1m&amp;sig=2rzaTdm6y6emde0gFvQlxRml9Sg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvxdTehffSAhWC3YMKHTZ4Co44ChDoAQhEMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%20colombo&amp;f=false" target="_blank">were shot out</a>; threatening phone calls came into his office. Strange cars followed him on the road. At Gulf &amp; Western, Paramount’s parent corporation, phoned-in bomb threats evacuated the building—twice.</p><p>Ruddy grew concerned, not only for his own welfare but for that of the picture. If Colombo wanted to disrupt the production by ordering Teamsters to sit idle or to arrange for scenery—or even actors—to come up missing, it would be disastrous.</p><p>Ruddy decided to capitulate. In early 1971, he arranged for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1971/08/15/archives/the-making-of-the-godfather-sort-of-a-home-movie-the-making-of-the.html" target="_blank">a meeting</a> with Joe Colombo and his son, Anthony, to discuss the picture. Ruddy handed them the 155-page script and insisted the film wouldn’t embrace the stereotypes the League was opposing.</p><p>Colombo was there to deal. He told Ruddy that if the filmmakers struck any mention of <em>mafia</em> or <em>la cosa nostra</em> from the script and donated proceeds from the movie’s premiere to the League, he wouldn’t obstruct the filming. Sensing he didn’t have much choice, Ruddy agreed: A public pronouncement was made in March 1971 that indicated <em>The Godfather</em> had the blessing of the League.</p><p>When executives at Gulf &amp; Western learned Ruddy had essentially made a handshake deal with the mob, they were furious. Stock prices plummeted; Ruddy was called to the carpet and fired from the film, only to be rehired at Coppola&#39;s insistence.</p><h2>Mob Rules</h2>

His strategy of an aggressive defense may have won him small victories in the general public’s knowledge of the mafia, but it would cause a fatal reaction among those in organized crime who didn’t like Colombo’s profile.</p><p>Months into shooting, Coppola had turned his attention from quieter scenes featuring family patriarch Don Corleone (<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78089/16-fascinating-facts-about-marlon-brando">Marlon Brando</a>) to the bloodshed resulting from his assassination. On June 28 and 29, 1971, the director shot grisly scenes of mob hits featuring machine guns and squibs.</p><p>Four blocks away from the film’s location, Colombo had assembled a rally for an Italian-American Unity Day. As he moved to the podium, a photographer with a press pass named Jerome Johnson cut through the crowd and toward the stage. Before Colombo realized what was happening, Johnson had raised a gun and fired three shots, hitting Colombo in the head. More guns were drawn, and Johnson was shot dead on the spot.</p><p>Colombo was rushed to the hospital, but his injuries were severe. He spent the next seven years in a coma before passing away in 1978.</p><p>Although the murder was never officially solved, it was believed that a returning and vengeful Gallo, tired of Colombo’s grandstanding, ordered his rival’s demise. In what was thought to be a retaliatory attack, Gallo was killed just one year later while eating at a restaurant for his birthday.</p><p>The murders were a surprise to Coppola, who had been concerned the violence depicted in the film might be outdated in what appeared to be a newer, more pacifistic organized crime landscape. When <em>The Godfather</em> opened in <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/godfather-review-1972-original-movie-986404/" target="_blank">March 1972</a>, it seemed more timely and prescient than ever.</p><p>Ruddy was unable to keep his promise to devote the premiere’s profits to the League, as Paramount refused to honor the deal. But he did host a private screening for the hundreds of limo-riding private citizens who expressed an interest in seeing the film in the New York area. They loved it and congratulated Ruddy on the accomplishment. Months prior, Ruddy had been forced to keep a .45 automatic gun in his desk drawer. It had been an uneasy, necessary alliance.</p><p>“Without the mafia’s help, it would’ve been impossible to make the picture,” <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=EA1SCEmDyBMC&amp;pg=PT116&amp;lpg=PT116&amp;dq=%22Without+the+mafia%E2%80%99s+help,+it+would%E2%80%99have+been+impossible+to+make+the+picture%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KvP2CyeSXq&amp;sig=muHlJwi2cg9ulFv64eZWMFbGmsA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj1zcP57Z3TAhVhLMAKHRpaD7IQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Without%20the%20mafia%E2%80%99s%20help%2C%20it%20would%E2%80%99have%20been%20impossible%20to%20make%20the%20picture%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Ruddy said</a>.</p><p><em>A version of this story ran in 2017; it has been updated for 2022.</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/93739/when-mob-protested-godfather?utm_source=RSS">The Real Story of 'The Offer': When the Mob Protested 'The Godfather'</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>You don&#39;t have to be a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/star-wars"><em>Star Wars</em></a> super fan to know who George Lucas is. The acclaimed filmmaker, who is also famous for creating the story behind the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77210/15-fun-facts-about-indiana-jones-movies"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a> series, has been one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest names for more than 40 years now. But here are some fascinating facts you might not know about George Lucas.</p><h2>1. George Lucas didn&#39;t always want to be a filmmaker.</h2><p>Lucas didn&#39;t always want to be a filmmaker. In fact, it was only after failing at a handful of other careers that he made his way into show business. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-lucas-star-wars-han-solo-greedo-318769" target="_blank"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>, as a teen Lucas dreamed of becoming a professional race car driver until a near-fatal accident while he was in high school derailed those plans. After graduating from high school, Lucas attempted to join the Air Force but was rejected because he had too many speeding tickets.</p><h2>2. He once worked as a camera operator for the Rolling Stones.</h2><p>One of Lucas’s earliest film jobs was serving as a <a href="https://theasc.com/magazine/sep02/exploring/" target="_blank">camera operator</a> on <em>Gimme Shelter</em>, Albert and David Maysles&#39;s critically acclaimed 1970 Rolling Stones film that documented the band’s free 1969 concert at the Altamont Speedway in California, which turned tragic when <a href="https://www.upi.com/Archives/1969/12/08/Death-debris-in-Altamont-wake/9131575577825" target="_blank">four concertgoers were killed</a> (including <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/remembering-meredith-hunter-the-fan-killed-at-altamont-630260/" target="_blank">Meredith Hunter</a>, who was stabbed to death not far from the stage, and whose murder was captured on film).</p><h2>3. Lucas&#39;s dog was a major influence on his work.</h2>

		<p>The Alaskan Malamute Lucas owned while writing the first <em>Star Wars</em> film <a href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/11/29/the-character-of-chewbacca-was-inspired-by-george-lucas-tall-hairy-alaskan-malamute-indiana/" target="_blank">inspired</a> two now-iconic characters: The dog’s name, Indiana, became the name of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72473/29-movies-almost-starred-harrison-ford">Harrison Ford’s</a> character in the <em>Indiana Jones</em> series. And the look of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56801/15-chewbacca-facts-honor-peter-mayhews-birthday">Chewbacca</a>, Han Solo’s faithful sidekick in the <em>Star Wars</em> series, was based on Lucas&#39;s pup.</p><p>“I had an Alaskan Malamute when I was writing the film [<em>Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope</em>],” Lucas <a href="https://denverartmuseum.org/article/how-george-lucas-dog-inspired-chewbacca" target="_blank">once shared</a>. “A very sweet dog, she would always sit next to me when I was writing. And when I&#39;d drive around, she&#39;d sit in the front seat. A Malamute is a very large dog—like a 130 pounds and bigger than a human being and very long-haired.”</p><h2>4. <em>Star Wars</em> wasn&#39;t an easy sell.</h2><p>While the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/79553/60-facts-about-star-wars-universe-star-wars-day"><em>Star Wars</em></a> franchise has turned into one of the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70920/10-highest-grossing-movie-franchises-all-time">most successful</a> film series in movie history, the first film was not immediately embraced by potential backers. According to Lucas, his “space opera” was turned down by both United Artists and Universal. And it was only because of the success of his previous film, 1975&#39;s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84009/13-nostalgic-facts-about-american-graffiti"><em>American Graffiti</em></a>, that he got people at 20th Century Fox to believe in him. Really, Lucas couldn&#39;t blame them for being skeptical of its commercial appeal. “It was crazy—spaceships, and Wookies, and robots,&#34; Lucas said. &#34;It was just unlike anything that had ever been seen before.&#34;</p><h2>5. He based Han Solo partly on Francis Ford Coppola.</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>The reason Han Solo from the <em>Star Wars</em> series is such a lovable character might be because he was loosely based on one of Lucas’s good friends. After spending time with director Francis Ford Coppola on the set of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/68031/17-fascinating-facts-about-apocalypse-now"><em>Apocalypse Now</em></a>, Lucas decided to add some of the Oscar-winning director&#39;s characteristics to Han.</p><h2>6. He won a Razzie.</h2><p>Although Lucas has been nominated for several Oscars, Golden Globes, Emmys, and various other prestigious awards, he has also received five Golden Raspberry (or Razzie) nominations, which celebrate the worst films made in any particular year. Between 1989 and 2003, Lucas earned five Razzie nominations and eventually took home the award for Worst Screenplay in 2003 (for <em>Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones</em>).</p><h2>7. Lucas&#39;s favorite <em>Star Wars</em> character is Jar Jar Binks. (Yes, really.)</h2><p>Though the <em>Star Wars</em> universe is filled with hundreds of memorable characters, Lucas—to the horror of many fans—has long maintained that the much maligned <a href="https://www.floor8.com/posts/jar-jar-binks-is-still-george-lucas-favorite-star-wars-character-01d8par9r3fn" target="_blank">Jar Jar Binks</a> is his favorite character. The goofy Gungan, who is featured in the prequels, is widely considered to be the series&#39;s <a href="https://www.theweek.co.uk/94797/why-is-jar-jar-binks-the-most-hated-character-in-star-wars" target="_blank">most unlikeable</a> character. In 2019, while discussing the 20th anniversary of <em>The Phantom Menace</em>, Lucas <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-47960054" target="_blank">stated</a> that the 1999 movie is one of his favorites in the series &#34;and, of course, Jar Jar is my favorite character.&#34; (Yes, he was dead-serious.)</p><h2>8. He was roommates with another famous director.</h2><p>Many members of Lucas’s group of friends, including Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg, went on to become famous writers and directors in their own right. As did Lucas&#39;s college roommate, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74228/15-slick-facts-about-grease"><em>Grease</em></a> director Randal Kleiser.</p><p>“[George and I] arrived at USC at the same time,” Kleiser <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/106520-15-grease-secrets-even-die-hard-fans-dont-know-from-director-randal-kleiser" target="_blank">told</a> Bustle in 2015. “He had a house in Topanga Canyon and needed a roommate, so I moved in. I had the bottom half of the house and he had the top. We worked on each other&#39;s first movies. I was an actor on his very first film, and he shot some of my stuff.” Kleiser also revealed that this led to the late <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/90403/30-memorable-quotes-carrie-fisher">Carrie Fisher</a>, who played Leia Organa in <em>Star Wars</em>, being considered for the role of Sandy in <em>Grease</em>.</p><h2>9. He once stood before Congress to argue against the alteration of classic films.</h2><p>In 1988, Lucas and Spielberg went to Washington, DC to speak before Congress about the necessity of adopting the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1988/03/04/auteur-auteur/934ab38b-42a0-4129-9fc1-08af00560e65/?utm_term=.4d1f1ccdd37f" target="_blank">Berne Convention</a>, a global agreement that protects an artist&#39;s copyright around the world and makes it unlawful for someone to alter it. (Ted Turner&#39;s penchant for colorizing classic black-and-white movies was a thorn in the side of many filmmakers at the time.)</p><p>“People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians,&#34; Lucas said. “[And] if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society.” Of course, Lucas himself would later <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/500941/time-george-lucas-warned-congress-about-dangers-altering-classic-movies">digitally alter</a> some of his own films, much to the annoyance of <em>Star Wars</em> purists.</p><h2>10. He plans to give away half his fortune.</h2><p>Lucas—who is the force behind some of the highest-grossing movies of all time, and sold his Lucasfilm to Disney for $4 billion—has an estimated net worth of approximately <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/george-lucas/#6e9e03a76e63" target="_blank">$5.5 billion</a>. But philanthropy, particularly when it comes to improving education, has always been a part of Lucas&#39;s life. In 2010, he signed the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/11/04/donating-star-wars-billions-will-make-george-lucas-one-of-the-biggest-givers-ever/#12d2232b2adb" target="_blank">Giving Pledge</a>, which is a promise to give away half his wealth during his lifetime.</p><p>&#34;I am dedicating the majority of my wealth to improving education,&#34; Lucas <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/george-lucas-2010-philanthropy-pledge-384948" target="_blank">wrote</a> in a 2010 editorial for <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em>. &#34;It is the key to the survival of the human race. We have to plan for our collective future—and the first step begins with the social, emotional, and intellectual tools we provide to our children. As humans, our greatest tool for survival is our ability to think and to adapt—as educators, storytellers, and communicators our responsibility is to continue to do so.&#34;</p><p><em>A version of this story ran in 2019; it has been updated for 2022.</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/582997/george-lucas-facts?utm_source=RSS">10 Surprising Facts About George Lucas</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Did you know that a day on Earth used to be around six hours shorter than it is today? Or that Julius Caesar once implemented a 445-day-long year? Learn those fascinating facts about time and more in this list, adapted from an episode of The List Show on YouTube. </p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9exgxjxeto?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><h2>1. Every person on Earth is living in the past. </h2><p>This may sound like the plot to some sci-fi, time-travel thriller, but it’s actually a fact of human biology and the trickiness of time. Our brains don’t perceive events until about 80 milliseconds until after they’ve happened. This fine line between the present and the past is part of the reason why some physicists argue that there’s <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/there-is-no-now/" target="_blank">no such thing</a> as “now” and that the present moment is no more than an illusion. </p><h2>2. Throughout history, different cultures around the world have experienced time in different ways. </h2><p>In the Western world, we tend to think of time as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191203-what-we-get-wrong-about-time" target="_blank">linear and flowing from left to right</a>. But this isn’t the case for everyone. Language affects how people conceptualize time, particularly the <a href="http://language.ucsd.edu/papers/language-time.pdf" target="_blank">spatial metaphors</a> they use to describe and map it. </p><p>Those who read languages that flow from right to left, such as Arabic and Hebrew, generally view time as flowing in the same direction. The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/27/science/27side.html" target="_blank">Aymara</a>, who live in the Andes Mountains in South America, consider the future to be behind them, while the past is ahead. In their view, because the future is unknown, it’s behind you, where you can’t see it. Some Indigenous Australian cultures, which rely heavily on <a href="http://language.ucsd.edu/papers/language-time.pdf" target="_blank">direction terms</a> like north, south, east, and west in their languages, visualize the passage of time as moving from east to west. If they’re facing north, for example, the past would be to their right, or east, whereas the future would be to their left, which would be west.</p><h2>3. Individual people can experience time differently, too. </h2><p>You’ve probably noticed how time seems to speed up when you’re racing against a deadline or having fun, and how it tends to drag when you’re bored. This is because when you’re focused on something, like a big work project or a party, your brain pays <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2017-08-29/science-explains-why-time-flies-when-youre-having-fun/8831478" target="_blank">less attention to how time passes</a>. But when you’re bored, or your brain is less stimulated, you become more aware of the passing of time, making it feel slower. One study proposed that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6042233/" target="_blank">dopamine</a>—the neurotransmitter and hormone that helps us feel happy—may be an additional culprit. It showed that increased dopamine production, which happens when you’re <a href="https://www.livescience.com/64901-time-fly-having-fun.html" target="_blank">enjoying something</a>, may slow down your body’s internal clock, making time feel like it’s flying by.</p><h2>4. Science has a number of different ways of defining time. </h2><p>To cover <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-june-30-leap-second-20150629-story.html" target="_blank">just a couple</a>: There’s astronomical time, which is measured in relation to how long it takes Earth to rotate on its axis. In astronomical time, a second is <a href="https://www.physicscentral.com/explore/plus/defining-time.cfm" target="_blank">1/60th of a minute</a>. And then there’s atomic time, which dictates the numbers that you’ll see on a clock. According to atomic time, one second equals 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a cesium-133 atom. Measuring the vibration of an atom—which, in simple terms, <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0002.964/--vibration-or-oscillation?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=Jean-Edme+Romilly" target="_blank">is the gist of what oscillation is</a>—is the most accurate way to track time.</p><h2>5. We can thank Albert Einstein for a lot of our current understanding of the physics of time. </h2>

				<figcaption>Albert Einstein | Hulton Archive/GettyImages</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p>Rather than viewing time as a set order, he proved that it’s actually relative. For example, according to <a href="https://www.space.com/21675-time-travel.html" target="_blank">Einstein’s theory of special relativity</a>, there’s an inverse relationship between your speed and the speed of time. The faster you move, the slower time moves. </p><p>This is why someone blasting through space will age slower than the people still hanging out on Earth: Astronaut Scott Kelly was born several minutes after his twin brother, Mark, but after Scott spent 340 days living on the International Space Station, he returned to Earth around <a href="https://www.space.com/33411-astronaut-scott-kelly-relativity-twin-brother-ages.html" target="_blank">an extra 5 milliseconds younger</a> than his “big” brother. Had Scott been traveling at a speed close to the speed of light, that age difference would have become much more pronounced.</p><h2>6. Einstein’s theory also states that gravity can warp time. </h2><p>If you’ve seen the 2014 movie <em>Interstellar</em>, <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/07/65014/how-does-time-dilation-affect-aging-during-high-speed-space-travel/" target="_blank">this concept may seem familiar</a>. The closer you are to a massive body—which, in the case of <em>Interstellar</em>, is a giant black hole—the slower time would pass for you. </p><h2>7. Gravity’s effect on time isn’t limited to intergalactic travel. </h2><p>Here on Earth, gravity can vary for a number of reasons, including your altitude, since you’re changing your distance from the center of the Earth. That means if you put a bunch of synchronized atomic clocks at <a href="https://mashable.com/2014/10/02/time-facts/" target="_blank">various altitudes</a>, eventually those clocks would fall out of sync. A clock at the top of Mount Everest and one at sea level would, over the entire 4.5 billion year history of the planet, have diverged by about a day and a half.</p><h2>8. Gravity is also the reason why our days are getting longer. </h2><p>Over a billion years ago, a day on Earth lasted <a href="https://www.space.com/40802-earth-days-longer-moon-movement.html" target="_blank">around 18 hours</a>. Our days are longer now because the moon’s gravity is causing Earth’s spin to slow down. In Earth’s earlier days, the moon wasn’t as far away, which caused Earth to spin much faster than it currently does. </p><p>Longer days also mean shorter years—kind of. The time it takes the Earth to orbit the sun hasn’t changed, but the amount of days within a year has. Back when the dinosaurs ruled <a href="https://www.livescience.com/earth-shorter-days-millions-years-ago.html" target="_blank">70 million years ago</a>, days were only around 23.5 hours long, and a year was made up of 372 of those slightly shorter days. </p><h2>9. There are two ways to think of the length of a day on Earth. </h2><p>Though you probably learned that one day on Earth is 24 hours, it actually takes the planet 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.0916 seconds to rotate on its axis. This is the <a href="https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/S/Sidereal+Day#:~:text=A%2520solar%2520day%2520is%2520the,to%2520the%2520&#39;fixed&#39;%2520stars." target="_blank">difference</a> between a solar day and a sidereal day—a solar day is 24 hours, whereas a sidereal day is roughly four minutes shorter. We measure solar time based on the sun’s position in the sky; a sidereal day is measured <a href="https://community.dur.ac.uk/john.lucey/users/e2_solsid.html" target="_blank">based on the location</a> of the “fixed” stars. In other words, a sidereal day is the time it takes for a distant star or constellation to <a href="http://hosting.astro.cornell.edu/academics/courses/astro201/sidereal.htm" target="_blank">appear on the same meridian</a>.</p><h2>10. Because astronomical time and atomic time don’t always line up, every so often, we get a leap second. </h2><p>Earth’s spin speed can be a bit unpredictable. Atmospheric winds, Northern Hemisphere winters with heavy snow, and other big weather systems can affect how fast the planet rotates. In order to keep the difference between astronomical time and atomic time to less than .9 seconds, the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service will occasionally <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-june-30-leap-second-20150629-story.html" target="_blank">announce the need for a leap second</a>. </p><p>Most people won’t notice a leap second, but they can be <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2942260/bruised-by-past-mistakes-tech-firms-brace-for-leap-second.html" target="_blank">a huge pain for tech companies</a>. Because leap seconds are added irregularly, developers have no way of working them into their codes, which has caused websites like LinkedIn and Reddit to crash in the past. A bug caused by 2012’s leap second created so much chaos on Qantas’s servers, more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/jul/02/leap-second-amadeus-qantas-reddit" target="_blank">400 flights</a> wound up being delayed.</p><h2>11. The length of a year on Earth can also get a bit complicated. </h2><p>The original Roman calendar was a bit of a mess, so much so that in 46 BCE Julius Caesar mandated a 445-day-long year to help bring the calendar back in sync with the seasons.</p><h2>12. At the same time, Caesar asked the astronomer Sosigenes to help reform the calendar. </h2>

		<p>Most years were set at 365 days, but to make up for the fact that the earth&#39;s revolution around the sun doesn&#39;t take <em>exactly</em> 365 days, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/614978/leap-year-facts">leap years were implemented</a>. Every four years the month of February was given an extra day to make up for what is a sort of rounding error in the calendar.</p><h2>13. But Sosigenes made a bit of a miscalculation, so the calendar continued to be a little off. </h2><p>He thought a year lasted 365.25 days. It’s actually around 365 days, five hours, 48 minutes, and 45 seconds, equivalent to about 365.242 days. This tiny error had some pretty big consequences: By 1577, the Julian calendar was off by 10 days, meaning key Christian holidays were being celebrated on incorrect dates. </p><p>Pope Gregory XIII took issue with this and established a commission to get the calendar back on track. In 1582, the Gregorian calendar was created. Rather than having an extra day every four years without exception, years that are divisible by 100—like 1700 or 1900—skip leap year. <em>Unless</em> the year is also divisible by 400, like the year 2000, in which case the Leap Year is back on!  Even this system isn’t perfect, though: It has an error of one day in 3236 years.</p><h2>14. We can thank the railroad industry for standardizing our time zones. </h2><p>Until the 19th century, towns and villages synchronized their clocks to the local solar noon. This created <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/railroads-create-the-first-time-zones" target="_blank">thousands of local times</a> that all varied and made scheduling transportation a major headache. Train schedules in different cities had to list dozens of arrival and departure times for each train to account for all the mini time zones. On November 18, 1883, railroad companies in the United States and Canada began using a system very similar to the standardized time zones we still use today. In the UK, the railroad companies began using a standard London-based time in 1840.</p><h2>15. After an engineer named Sandford Fleming missed a train in 1876, he set out to change the way time worked. </h2><p>Fleming <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/12/the-creation-of-modern-time/421419/" target="_blank">originally proposed</a> a concept he called “Cosmic Time,” in which the world would run off an imaginary clock located at the planet’s center, essentially a line from the center of the planet to the sun. He then suggested splitting the world into 24 time zones labeled with a letter of the alphabet, with each zone spanning 15 degrees of longitude. His original plan to create a standard “Cosmic Time” was rejected, but it did lay the groundwork for a similar standardization, so-called <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/sandford-fleming-sets-the-worlds-clock-389930/" target="_blank">Universal Time</a>. And nations present at the 1884 International Meridian Conference laid the groundwork for dividing the world into 24 time zones, with the Prime Meridian, also known as Longitude 0°, running through Greenwich, England. </p><h2>16. Even with the advent of standardized time, people still struggled to keep their clocks in sync. </h2><p>One London family used this to their advantage, and made a living by selling people the time. An astronomer named <a href="https://blog.sciencemuseum.org.uk/ruth-belville-the-greenwich-time-lady/" target="_blank">John Belville</a> would set his pocket watch to the time at the Royal Observatory Greenwich. He would then travel around the city and visit his network of subscribers, who paid to set their own clocks by Belville’s pocket watch. After Belville died in 1856, his wife, and then later their daughter Ruth, carried on the tradition. Ruth continued to sell the time until World War II. By then she was in her eighties, and a couple of factors led to her timely retirement: Improved technology had made her role less important, and the war was making treks around London too dangerous.</p><h2>17. Time zones can still be a bit complicated. </h2>

		<p>Big countries like Canada and the United States have multiple time zones, whereas China, another large country, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/china-only-has-one-time-zone-and-thats-a-problem/281136/" target="_blank">only has one</a>. China adopted the Beijing Standard Time to foster unity, but the effect can feel a bit uncanny—two cities in the country can be at roughly the same latitude, but experience sunrise hours apart, according to their clocks. In some parts of China, for example, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/china-only-has-one-time-zone-and-thats-a-problem/281136/" target="_blank">the sun doesn’t rise</a> until nearly 10 a.m. </p><h2>18. Though a lot of people believe daylight saving time was adopted to keep farmers happy, that’s a myth.</h2><p>The first person to seriously advocate for daylight saving time was an<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/88302/10-fascinating-facts-about-daylight-saving-time"> entomologist</a> who wanted more sunlit hours to look for insects after work in the summer. He proposed his idea to a scientific society in New Zealand in 1895. </p><h2>19. Daylight saving time wasn’t officially implemented until 1916.</h2><p>Germany became the first country to adopt it in an effort to conserve coal during World War I. The United States <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/88302/10-fascinating-facts-about-daylight-saving-time">didn’t follow suit until 1918</a>.</p><h2>20. Daylight saving time ended on a national level after the war, but individual states and municipalities kept it going until World War II.</h2><p>At the end of World War I, the entire nation went on what was effectively a year-round daylight saving time. After World War II, the entire nation was again picking and choosing daylight saving time. It’s been reported that in Iowa, back in 1964, there were 23 different combinations of dates that communities turned on and off daylight saving time. In 1966, the government officially mandated a standardized daylight saving time for the entire United States, though individual states can opt out.</p><p>Until 2007, daylight saving time ended in October. It’s been reported that the candy industry lobbied to wait until after Halloween to change the clocks back an hour. </p><h2>21. Daylight saving time does more than make people lose an hour of sleep. </h2><p>In fact, it can have some pretty concerning health effects. Studies have <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/575331/daylight-saving-time-effects">linked daylight saving time</a> with an uptick in heart attacks, car crashes, and mining injuries. The extra hour of daylight is good for koalas, though: Researchers found that koala-car collisions went down by up to 11 percent during daylight saving time.</p><h2>22. People have been tracking time for thousands of years. </h2><p>In 2013, archaeologists found what’s thought to be the world&#39;s <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/7/130715-worlds-oldest-calendar-lunar-cycle-pits-mesolithic-scotland/" target="_blank">oldest lunar calendar</a> while excavating a field in Scotland. The calendar, which is made of a series of 12 pits that mimic the moon’s phases, dates back to around 8000 BCE. </p><h2>23. Sundials read differently depending on the hemisphere you’re in. </h2>

		<p>In the Northern Hemisphere, the sun casts a shadow that moves from north, to east, to south, to west. In the Southern Hemisphere, the shadow moves in the opposite direction. Our concept of “<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69698/why-do-clocks-run-clockwise">clockwise</a>” is based on the way sundials in the Northern Hemisphere told time.</p><h2>24. An innovative clock was built in China in 1090. </h2><p>A man named Su Song created a water-powered clock tower that measured time and tracked the movements of the planets and stars in the night sky. Su Song built a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%252F978-1-4020-6460-9_6" target="_blank">giant water wheel</a> within the clock tower. Buckets attached to the wheel would fill with water and then tip once full, causing the wheel to rotate, demarcating time.</p><h2>25. The Maya had multiple calendars to measure time.</h2><p>The most familiar is the Long Count Calendar. These calendars measured around 5125 years, beginning around August 3114 BCE. The Long Count calendar’s cycle came to an end around December 21, 2012, sparking a craze of Armageddon conspiracy theories.</p><h2>26. You’ll find the most accurate clock at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado. </h2><p>The clock keeps time by measuring the vibration of a <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/worlds-accurate-clock-now/story?id=64877303" target="_blank">single aluminum ion</a>, and should remain accurate for 33 billion years. The clock sitting on your bedside table isn&#39;t quite as precise.</p><h2>27. New clocks are set at 10:10 for a reason.</h2><p>If you’ve bought a new clock or watch recently, you may have noticed that the default setting was 10:10, give or take a few minutes. There are various theories behind this particular choice of time, but really, it all comes down to aesthetics. Setting the time to around 10:10 allows the hands of an analog clock to be displayed in a neat, symmetrical way that doesn’t obscure any logos in the center of the clock’s face. Clocks were once set to 8:20, and occasionally still are, but the hands’ downward angles can make it look like the timepieces are frowning.</p><h2>28. Traveling back in time is possible—theoretically, at least. </h2><p>According to Einstein’s theory, you could travel back in time by moving faster than the speed of light, as long as you could somehow have infinite mass. Since that probably won’t work, you could create “<a href="https://www.space.com/21675-time-travel.html" target="_blank">wormholes</a>” between two points in space-time. (This would also be tough, since humanity still hasn’t invented the technology to actually build a wormhole.) Or you could try bending space-time by plucking some “cosmic strings.” Two of these theoretical strings, which are thin streams of pure energy that are moving in opposite directions at very near the speed of light, could theoretically warp space-time enough to create a closed time-like curve—also known as a time machine. </p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/facts-about-time?utm_source=RSS">28 Fascinating Facts About Time</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Some customers aren’t looking for a plain black coffee when they visit <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64991/14-freshly-brewed-facts-about-starbucks">Starbucks</a>—instead, they prefer their drinks to taste like pumpkin pie, birthday cake, or even stout beer. The chain has released many products over the years that stretch its reputation as a coffeehouse, and while some are now menu staples, others were shown the door within a few months. Whether customers were happy to see them go or begged for their return, you can no longer find these discontinued beverages at your local Starbucks. </p><h2>1. Valencia Orange Refresher</h2>

		<p>Starbucks is famous for its cozy holiday drinks, but it&#39;s had success with summer menu items as well. The <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2013/starbucks-introduces-new-refreshment-line-up-with-valencia-orange-starbucks/" target="_blank">Valencia Orange Refresher</a> gained a cult following shortly after it was introduced in 2013. The iced beverage consisted of real fruit juice flavored with orange peel, cardamom, jasmine, and apricot, plus green coffee extract for a boost of caffeine. Fans have been mourning the drink since it was <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-angers-customers-by-cancelling-valencia-orange-2015-6" target="_blank">discontinued in 2015</a>, leading to the creation of <a href="https://www.change.org/p/starbucks-bring-back-the-valencia-orange-refresher?recruiter=326838172&amp;utm_" target="_blank">online petitions</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bringbackvor" target="_blank">social media campaigns</a> aimed at saving the Refresher from obscurity.<br/><br/></p><h2>2. Cherries Jubilee Mocha</h2><p>Not every seasonal drink from <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/578283/starbucks-employee-secrets">Starbucks</a> has the staying power of the Peppermint Mocha or Pumpkin Spice Latte. During the 2013 holiday season, the brand tested two drinks in select markets: the <a href="https://www.today.com/food/heres-starbucks-holiday-drink-didnt-make-cut-1d80237026" target="_blank">Cherries Jubilee Mocha</a> and the Chestnut Praline Latte. The Chestnut Praline Latte was made a permanent part of the holiday menu the following year, while the Cherries Jubilee Mocha never reached the wider market.</p><h2>3. Eggnog Latte</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653245/why-eggnog-called-eggnog">Eggnog</a> Latte was a recurring item on Starbucks’s winter holiday menu after the chain launched it in 1986, so it came as a shock when <a href="https://www.eatthis.com/news-starbucks-discontinued-popular-menu-item/" target="_blank">it was missing</a> from stores in December 2021. Starbucks introduced the <a href="https://www.gwhatchet.com/2021/12/06/starbucks-2021-holiday-drinks-ranked/" target="_blank">Iced Sugar Cookie Almond Milk Latte</a> in its place, perhaps hoping to appeal to young consumers who prefer plant-based milk to the dairy kind.</p><h2>4. Unicorn Frappuccino</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>The Unicorn Frappuccino took the world (a.k.a. Instagram) by storm when it appeared on Starbucks’s menu in 2017. The technicolor frozen beverage featured such <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/94552/unicorn-frappuccinos-spotted-starbucks">whimsical ingredients</a> as “pink powder” and blue “unicorn dust.” <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2017/starbucks-unicorn-frappuccino/" target="_blank">Mango syrup</a> and a sour blue drizzle gave it a fruity flavor, but the taste was less important than how the drink appeared in photos. Despite its viral success, the elusive Unicorn Frappuccino was only available for a <a href="https://www.foodnewsnews.com/starbucks/why-was-the-unicorn-frappuccino-discontinued-at-starbucks/" target="_blank">limited time</a>. </p><h2>5. Chantico</h2><p>The Chantico was decadent, even compared to Starbucks’s notoriously sweet standards. Inspired by the <a href="https://www.anediblemosaic.com/parisian-style-drinking-chocolate/" target="_blank">drinking chocolate</a> that’s popular in France, it was basically melted <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62588/30-facts-about-chocolate">chocolate</a> you could sip like coffee. The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210425203000/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/food/2006-02-10-chantico_x.htm" target="_blank">liquid dessert</a> had some fans, but it was removed from stores in 2006, with the company citing that a lack of customization options hurt its sales. “It was something that customers did like, but they wanted to be able to do something else with it,” spokesman Alan Hilowitz said. “We wanted to go back and give customers what they are looking for.”</p><h2>6. Zombie Frappuccino</h2><p>The popularity of the Unicorn Frappuccino inspired a wave of themed, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/587565/tie-dye-frappuccino-starbucks-new-drink-summer" target="_blank">limited-edition Frappuccinos</a> from Starbucks in the late 2010s. The <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/press/2017/starbucks-zombie-frappuccino/" target="_blank">Zombie Frappuccino</a> was available for the 2017 Halloween season, and it couldn’t have been more different from its sparkly predecessor. The drink went for gross rather than cute, with a ghastly green apple base, “bloody” red mocha drizzle, and pink whipped cream “brains.”</p><h2>7. Dark Barrel Latte</h2><p>The Dark Barrel Latte is another Starbucks drink that never broke out of <a href="https://www.foodbeast.com/news/starbucks-beer-lattes/" target="_blank">test markets</a>. Sold in <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/food/Starbucks-Dark-Barrel-Latte-35789231" target="_blank">Florida and Ohio</a> in 2014, the coffee beverage was topped with a dark, malty caramel sauce that gave it a stout-like (but non-alcoholic) flavor. The unique drink created a buzz, but there apparently wasn’t a big demand for coffee that tastes like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61195/11-common-misconceptions-about-beer">beer</a> among Starbucks’s clientele. </p><h2>8. Chile Mocha</h2>

		<p>After experimenting with French hot chocolate, Starbucks released its version of Mexican hot chocolate in 2016. The <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2016/psl-chile-mocha-2016/" target="_blank">Chile Mocha</a> combined chocolatey espresso with ancho and cayenne chile powder for a sweet-and-spicy kick. After appearing on the menu for the 2016 fall season, the beverage was retired the <a href="https://soyummy.com/screw-psl-7-drinks-starbuckss-past-much-better/" target="_blank">following year</a>.</p><h2>9. Birthday Cake Frappuccino</h2><p>The Frappuccino has been one of the coffee chain&#39;s biggest sellers since it was introduced in 1995. And to celebrate the beverage’s 20-year anniversary, a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/72592-does-the-starbucks-birthday-cake-frappuccino-have-caffeine-we-did-some-digging-to-find-out" target="_blank">Birthday Cake Frappuccino</a> appeared on the menu for a <a href="https://www.bustle.com/articles/73267-the-starbucks-birthday-cake-frappuccino-may-be-gone-but-well-always-remember-it-and-these-other" target="_blank">limited time</a> in 2015. The indulgent concoction consisted of a vanilla bean and hazelnut blend topped with whipped cream. Starbucks revived it briefly for the Frappuccino’s 21st birthday in 2016 before getting rid of it for good.</p><h2>10. Berry Sangria Tea</h2><p>The <a href="https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/2016/teavana-berry-sangria-herbal-tea-at-starbucks/" target="_blank">Berry Sangria Tea</a> was another attempt at serving an “alcohol-inspired” drink without a liquor license. Released in 2016, the beverage was made from Teavana Iced Passion Tango Tea mixed with sangria syrup containing peach, elderberry, blood orange, and raspberry flavors. The concoction was served with real blackberries and orange slices to emulate the classic fruit-and-wine drink.

        <![CDATA[<p>In <em>The Offer,</em> the new series streaming on Paramount+, viewers are getting a closer look at the tumultuous production of 1972’s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62427/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-godfather"><em>The Godfather</em></a>. Widely considered a classic, it was a challenging effort for director Francis Ford Coppola, producer Al Ruddy, and novelist Mario Puzo, in part because the very real mafia<a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/93739/when-mob-protested-godfather"> protested</a> its depiction of Italian-Americans. </p><p>It was Puzo who would come nose-to-nose with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72460/35-fabulous-facts-about-frank-sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> over it, a scene from the first episode that actually <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-offer-mario-puzo-frank-sinatra-godfather-1235134846/" target="_blank">took place</a>.</p><p>The (real) Sinatra and Puzo ran into one another when Puzo was in Los Angeles toiling on the screenplay for the movie, which had yet to commence production. Puzo had already incited controversy, however, with his 1969 novel drawing much of the same criticisms as the film would.</p><p>Sinatra was one of those critics. An iconic singer who allegedly had friends in the mafia, he disliked how <em>The Godfather</em> portrayed Italian-Americans. It was also widely believed that the character of Johnny Fontane, a singer and actor whose career was facilitated by organized crime, was based on Sinatra. Coppola later <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/sinatra-at-100-was-a-844595/" target="_blank">admitted</a> as much on a DVD commentary, saying Fontane was “based on a kind of Frank Sinatra character.”</p><p>Paramount, which produced the film, was uneasy about the Fontane character, fearing Sinatra could sue. Sinatra had <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/movies-and-tv/2022/3/21/22988933/the-godfather-50th-anniversary-frank-sinatra-loathed-novel-told-author-mario-puzo-to-choke" target="_blank">previously demanded</a> to see an early manuscript of the novel. He also reportedly cautioned actor and singer Al Martino that if he played Fontane in the movie, he would be banned from performing in Las Vegas. (Martino took the part and, despite the threat, continued to perform there.)</p><p>All of this was apparently on Sinatra’s mind when Puzo spotted him at popular L.A. restaurant Chasen’s <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2022/03/18/godfather-50th-anniversary-frank-sinatra-famous-fight-mario-puzo/6997604001/" target="_blank">chatting</a> with John Wayne. Puzo agreed to meet Sinatra, perhaps not knowing how strongly he felt about the novel. He soon found out, with Sinatra initially rebuffing a mutual friend’s attempt to introduce the two.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Sinatra said. “I don’t want to meet him.” Sinatra then began screaming and threatening Puzo, though his exact words don’t appear to have been recorded for posterity.</p><p>“Listen, it wasn’t my idea,” Puzo said, though it’s not clear whether Sinatra took that to mean the greeting or the Fontane character. Sinatra added that he would beat the hell out of Puzo were it not for the fact the latter was older.</p><p>According to Ruddy, who was also there, Puzo had to be restrained and ushered out of the restaurant. He later told Ruddy he was disheartened Sinatra, one of his idols, was so upset with him.</p><p>The scene in <em>The Offer</em> is, naturally, exaggerated for dramatic effect. Sinatra uses profanity—Puzo once recalled Sinatra refrained from expletives during their altercation—and the onscreen Puzo defended himself with a fork. No weapons, cutlery or otherwise, were involved.</p><p><em>[h/t</em><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-offer-mario-puzo-frank-sinatra-godfather-1235134846/" target="_blank"><em> The Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>]</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/the-offer-frank-sinatra-mario-puzo-godfather-fight?utm_source=RSS">Yes, Frank Sinatra and Mario Puzo Really Did Get Into a Fight Over 'The Godfather'</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In the fall of 1979, a group of unknown actors, a director desperate for a hit, and a special effects visionary got together in the woods of New Jersey to create the stuff of legend. <em>Friday the 13th</em> was supposed to be a simple exercise in good movie business, a film that would make money thanks to clever manipulation of the horror genre and some gory scares. Instead, it became a watershed moment in horror filmmaking, a landmark that has inspired countless imitators and nearly a dozen sequels.</p><p>Today, <em>Friday the 13th</em> is an essential slasher classic, but the road to success wasn’t exactly easy. To celebrate the film, and its often tumultuous production, here are 17 facts about the birth of the legend of Jason Voorhees.</p><h2>1. THE ORIGINAL INSPIRATION WAS <em>HALLOWEEN</em>.</h2><p>In 1978, producer and director Sean Cunningham was looking for a model on which to build a commercially successful film, and he found one in John Carpenter’s horror classic <em>Halloween</em>. The two films ultimately don’t share much other than very broad slasher tropes, but Cunningham says he “was very influenced by the structure of Carpenter’s film.”</p><h2>2. THE FILM WAS BEING ADVERTISED BEFORE IT EVEN HAD FINANCING.</h2><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WCO4v-pFBns?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>
Hoping to drum up publicity for his project, Cunningham took out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fridaythe13thfranchise.com/2014/11/the-variety-ad-that-helped-launch.html">an ad</a> in the July 4, 1979 edition of <em>Variety</em>, featuring the film’s now-iconic logo bursting through glass. At the time, the general structure of the film was in place, but Georgetown Productions had not yet fully agreed to finance it, and the advertised November 1979 release date was a pipe dream. Still, Cunningham did get a response from the ad. “Everybody wanted this film,” he later said.</p><h2>3. THE SCREENWRITER HAD A DIFFERENT TITLE IN MIND.</h2><p>Though Cunningham very quickly latched on to the idea of <em>Friday the </em><em>13th</em> as a title, well before the film got made, screenwriter Victor Miller originally came up with something else. In the spring of 1979, he was calling the film <em>Long Night at Camp Blood</em>.</p><h2>4. MANY OF THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE “BAKED” IN THE CAMP’S KITCHEN.</h2><p>Tom Savini is now a makeup effects legend thanks, in part, to his work on <em><em>Friday the 13th</em></em><em>.</em> And in making the film, he and assistant Taso Stavrakis actually ended up using the camp to finalize the special makeup effects. According to Savini, many of the latex appliances ultimately used to create the film’s gruesome murders were baked in the pizza ovens at the camp where the movie was filmed.</p><h2>5. THE CAMP USED FOR FILMING IS STILL OPERATIONAL.</h2><p>Camp Crystal Lake is actually Camp No-Be-Bo-Sco, a fully operational camp that the cast and crew were granted access to after campers left for the summer in 1979. It <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nobebosco.org/about/about-the-camp">is still in use today</a>.</p><h2>6. KEVIN BACON WAS NOT THE FILM’S BIGGEST STAR AT THE TIME OF SHOOTING.</h2>

		<p>Though he’s without question the biggest name in the movie now, Kevin Bacon hadn’t done much prior to <em>Friday the 13th</em>, apart from things like a small role in <em>Animal House</em>. At the time, the film’s biggest name was Harry Crosby, son of then-recently-deceased legendary singer Bing Crosby, who played Bill.</p><h2>7. SHELLEY WINTERS WAS THE FIRST CHOICE FOR MRS. VOORHEES.</h2><p>For the now-iconic role of Mrs. Pamela Voorhees, Cunningham and company went in search of an actress with a recognizable name whose career was nevertheless on the decline, so she could be paid relatively little and the budget could stay low. Cunningham eventually made a list of actresses he was considering, and two-time Oscar winner Shelley Winters was his top choice. Winters wasn’t interested, and while fellow candidate and Oscar-winner Estelle Parsons actually <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews37_42/page21.cfm">negotiated</a> to be in the film, she ultimately backed out. Cunningham also considered actresses Louise Lasser and Dorothy Malone right up until filming began, but ultimately the production wound up with Betsy Palmer in the role.</p><h2>8. BETSY PALMER TOOK THE PART SO SHE COULD BUY A NEW CAR.</h2><p>When Cunningham finally got around to offering Palmer the part of Mrs. Voorhees, she suddenly found herself in need of cash. After more than a year on Broadway, her car broke down as she drove back to her home in Connecticut. She might never have taken the movie if she hadn’t needed the money for a new car.</p><p>“I got home at five in the morning, and it was a situation where I desperately needed a new car,” Palmer said. “If I hadn’t needed a car, I don’t think I would’ve done <em>Friday the 13th</em>.”</p><h2>9. SEVERAL CREW MEMBERS PLAYED THE KILLER BEFORE PALMER WAS CAST.</h2><p>Even as filming got underway, Cunningham was still looking for an actress to play Mrs. Voorhees, so many of the early murder scenes were actually shot without Betsy Palmer, with members of the crew standing in for the hands of the murderer. For example, when Annie’s (Robbi Morgan) throat is cut early in the film, special effects assistant Taso Stavrakis is the one wielding the knife.</p><h2>10. BETSY PALMER GAVE MRS. VOORHEES A DETAILED BACKSTORY.</h2><p>When she was finally cast, Palmer dove deep into her character. As a Method actor, she wanted to know more about the character than the audience, and came up with a backstory that built on the killer’s hatred of sexual transgression. In her mind, Pamela had Jason out of wedlock with a high school boyfriend, and her parents ultimately disowned her for her sins <a target="_blank" href="https://thedissolve.com/news/5832-betsy-palmer-1926-2015/">because that</a> “isn’t something that good girls do.&#34;</p><h2>11. JASON WAS JUST A REGULAR KID IN THE FIRST DRAFT.</h2>

		<p>In Victor Miller’s original script, the character of Jason Voorhees was, basically, just a kid who accidentally drowned in Crystal Lake. But financier Philip Scuderi wanted something more, and brought in screenwriter Ron Kurz for some rewrites. One of Kurz’s most important contributions to the film was to transform the tragic boy into the deformed child we see in the final movie.</p><h2>12. DURING FILMING, THE CREW WAS ENTERTAINED BY LOU REED.</h2><p>Because the camp was closed during filming, and situated in the deep New Jersey woods, the cast and crew didn’t see much outside interference, but it turned out they had a very famous neighbor: rock star Lou Reed, who owned a farm nearby.</p><p>“We got to watch Lou Reed play for free, right in front of us, while we were making the film,” soundman Richard Murphy said. “He came by the set and we hung around with each other and he was just a really great guy.”</p><h2>13. ONE ACTOR WAS TEMPORARILY BLINDED BY FAKE BLOOD.</h2><p>For the scene in which Bill (Harry Crosby) is killed by multiple arrows, one of which lands in his eye, Tom Savini used a fake blood formula that included a wetting agent called PhotoFlo, which was supposed to make the fake blood soak into clothing and look more realistic. Unfortunately, PhotoFlo is not an ingredient used for “safe blood,” meaning blood that’s going to be encountering the face of an actor. For the arrow-in-the-eye moment, a latex appliance was applied to Crosby’s face, along with the blood. As the scene was shot, the blood welled up into Crosby’s eyes, causing intense pain when the appliance was removed.</p><p>“So our unsafe blood had an opportunity to fill up Harry’s eyes under the appliance used to keep the arrow looking like it was in his eye and it surface-burned poor Harry,” Savini said. “Not a proud moment.”</p><p>Crosby had to be taken to the hospital for treatment, but was ultimately fine.</p><h2>14. KEVIN BACON’S ICONIC DEATH TOOK HOURS TO FILM (AND ALMOST DIDN’T WORK).</h2><p>Perhaps the most iconic death in the film occurs when Jack (Kevin Bacon) is killed with an arrow shoved through his throat from underneath the bed he’s lying on. It’s a brilliant special effects moment, and was also the most complex death scene in the film. To make it work, Bacon had to crouch under the bed and insert his head through a hole in the mattress. Then, a latex neck and chest appliance were attached to give the appearance that he was actually lying down. Getting the setup right took hours, and Bacon had to stay in that uncomfortable position the entire time. For the bloody final moment, Savini—also under the bed—would plunge the arrow up and through the fake neck, while his assistant—also under the bed—operated a pump that would make the fake blood flow up through the appliance. To further complicate things, the crew needed someone to stand in for the killer’s hand as it held Bacon’s head down, and they settled on still photographer Richard Feury.</p><p>So, after hours of setup and latex building and planning, it was finally time to shoot the scene, and when the moment of truth came, the hose for the blood pump disconnected. Knowing that he basically only had one take (otherwise they’d have to build a new latex appliance and set everything up again), Stavrakis grabbed the hose and blew into it until blood flowed out, saving the scene.</p><p>“I had to think quick, so I just grabbed the hose and blew like crazy which, thankfully, caused a serendipitous arterial blood spray,” Stavrakis said. “The blood didn’t taste that bad either.”</p><h2>15. THE FINAL SCARE WAS SUPPOSEDLY NOT IN THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT.</h2><p>The story of who invented the final scare in the film, in which a deformed Jason bursts out of the lake and grabs Alice (Adrienne King) from her canoe, is disputed. Victor Miller, Tom Savini, and uncredited screenwriter Ron Kurz all claim credit for it, Kurz because he claims to be the one who made Jason into a “creature,” and Savini because he claims the moment was inspired by a similar final scare in <em>Carrie</em>. Whatever the case, it left a lasting impression.</p><h2>16. THE MAIN THEME MUSIC CAME FROM A LINE OF DIALOGUE.</h2><p>When composing the score for the film, composer Harry Manfredini was looking for a distinctive sound to identify any point when the killer appeared in a scene. When he first saw a print of the film, he heard Mrs. Voorhees, imitating Jason, saying “Kill her, Mommy!” and decided that was the key. So, he took two syllables from that line of dialogue, spoke them himself, and <a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060511052302/http:/www.slasherama.com/features/harry.HTML">made the iconic sound</a>.</p><p>“So I got the idea of taking the &#39;ki&#39; from &#39;kill&#39; and the &#39;ma&#39; from &#39;mommy,’ but spoke them very harshly, distinctly, and rhythmically into a microphone and run them through this &#39;70s echo thing. It came up as you hear it today! So every time there was the perspective of the stalker, I put that into the score,” Manfredini said.</p><h2>17. THE SCREENWRITER HATES THE SEQUELS.</h2>

		<p>One of the key twists of the original film, particularly in light of its many sequels (counting a crossover with <em>A Nightmare on Elm Street</em> and a reboot, there are 11 now), is that Jason is not actually the central figure. He provides a haunting mythology, but the real villain is his mother. For screenwriter Victor Miller, this was very important, and he framed Pamela Voorhees as the mother he never had, a woman who tirelessly professed love in her own crazy way. When the film became a hit, and the inevitable sequel featured Jason as the new killer, Miller was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.victormiller.com/faq.php">disappointed</a>.</p><p>“To be honest, I have not seen any of the sequels, but I have a major problem with all of them because they made Jason the villain,” Miller said. “I still believe that the best part of my screenplay was the fact that a mother figure was the serial killer—working from a horribly twisted desire to avenge the senseless death of her son, Jason. Jason was dead from the very beginning. He was a victim, not a villain. But I took motherhood and turned it on its head and I think that was great fun. Mrs. Voorhees was the mother I&#39;d always wanted—a mother who would have killed for her kids.”</p><p><strong>Additional Sources</strong>: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Location-Blairstown-Making-Friday-13th/dp/0988446820/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1456029938&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=on+location+in+blairstown+the+making+of+friday+the+13th"><em>On Location In Blairstown: The Making of Friday the 13</em><em><sup>th</sup></em></a><em> </em>by David Grove (2013)</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/77061/17-bloody-facts-about-friday-13th?utm_source=RSS">17 Surprising Facts About Friday the 13th </a>. </p>]]>

He stayed close friends with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/anne-of-cleves-henry-viii-wife">Anne of Cleves</a>, for example, following their divorce in 1540; and his union with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Catherine-Parr" target="_blank">Catherine Parr</a> only ended because he died.</p><p>But the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67496/20-pieces-advice-old-tudor-proverbs">Tudor</a> ruler’s relationship with <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/586833/anne-boleyn-facts">Anne Boleyn</a> was dramatic from start to finish. Henry had become infatuated with Anne during her stint as a lady-in-waiting to his first wife, <a href="https://www.hrp.org.uk/hampton-court-palace/history-and-stories/katherine-of-aragon/#gs.xbc95f" target="_blank">Catherine of Aragon</a>, in the mid-1520s. All but one of Catherine and Henry’s children—the future Queen Mary I—died in infancy or earlier, and it began to seem highly unlikely that they’d succeed in producing a healthy male heir. So in 1527, hoping for better luck with Anne, Henry <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Henry-VIII-king-of-England/Loss-of-popularity" target="_blank">sought</a> an annulment from Catherine on the <a href="https://royalcentral.co.uk/features/history-blogs/why-did-henry-viii-seek-an-annulment-of-his-marriage-to-catherine-of-aragon-143080/" target="_blank">grounds</a> that because she’d previously been married to his (now-deceased) brother, his own union with her was invalid. Catherine’s childbearing difficulties could even have been the result of their unholy matrimony, if a certain Bible verse was to be believed.</p><p>Whatever Pope Clement VII’s personal feelings about the cogency of that argument, they took a backseat to the international affairs at play when the claim came in; namely, that Charles V—Holy Roman Emperor, King of Spain, and Catherine’s nephew—was in the process of <a href="https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/anglo-papal-relations-henry-viii-break-with-rome/" target="_blank">taking over Rome</a>. With that situation coloring his decision, the pope <a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/pope-clement-vii-forbids-king-henry-viii-from-remarrying" target="_blank">denied</a> the annulment request and instead informed Henry that he’d be excommunicated should he marry Anne anyway. </p><p>In 1533, Henry VIII <a href="https://www.history.com/news/anne-boleyn-beheaded-facts" target="_blank">married Anne anyway</a>, breaking away from the Catholic Church and changing the course of British history in the process.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, Henry and Anne’s honeymoon phase was short-lived. After three years of marriage, Anne, too, had failed to produce a surviving male heir (though she had given birth to the future <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61090/15-royally-amazing-facts-about-queen-elizabeth-i">Queen Elizabeth I</a>). Possibly encouraged by advisors keen to oust Anne, Henry VIII began to believe that she had been unfaithful to him. In 1536, she was imprisoned in the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/630805/tower-of-london-facts">Tower of London</a> on <a href="https://time.com/5739697/anne-boleyn-biography-women-history/" target="_blank">charges</a> of adultery and treason, found guilty, and <a href="https://www.history.com/news/anne-boleyn-beheaded-facts" target="_blank">beheaded</a> on May 19. Anne’s self-made widower quickly wed one of her ladies-in-waiting, Jane Seymour—already his mistress—and seemingly put his second wife out of his mind for good.</p><p>But if ever there were a time for Henry VIII to express remorse over the downfall of Anne Boleyn, it probably would have been on his deathbed. And there is some evidence suggesting he did just that. </p><h2>The Friar’s Report</h2><p>In 1575, French explorer and Franciscan friar André Thevet <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-5983142" target="_blank">published</a> a sweeping world history called <em>La Cosmographie Universelle</em>, which included a brief account of Henry’s death.</p><p>“Several English gentlemen have assured me that he had fine repentance of the offenses committed by him, being at the point of death: &amp; among other things, of the injustice &amp; crime committed against the said Queen Anne Boleyn, falsely vanquished &amp; accused of what was imposed on her,” Thevet <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/La_cosmographie_universelle_d_Andr%C3%A9_The/7HRoAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=%22Gentilshommes%20Anglois%22" target="_blank">wrote</a>, translated from French.</p>

		<p>Though Thevet didn’t mention any contacts by name, 16th-century Protestant historian John Foxe supported the assertion that Henry VIII did indeed do some repenting during his final hours. In his book<em> Actes and Monuments</em> (also known as the<em> Book of Martyrs</em>), Foxe explained that as Henry VIII’s health deteriorated, Privy Councillor <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG25016" target="_blank">Sir Anthony Denny</a> bravely broke the news to the king that he’d likely die soon—a task nobody else had <a href="https://archive.org/details/henryviiikingcou0000weir_o0s3/page/502/mode/2up?q=%22king+was+beyond+speech%22" target="_blank">wanted</a> to do. Denny then “exhorted him to prepare himself to death, calling himself to remembrance of his former life, and to call upon God in Christ betimes for grace and mercy, as becometh every good Christian man to do” [<a href="https://www.exclassics.com/foxe/foxe7pdf.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>]. According to Foxe, the ailing monarch then proceeded to “consider his life past.” </p><p>“‘Yet,’ said he, ‘is the mercy of Christ able to pardon me all my sins, though they were greater than they be,’” Foxe wrote.</p><p>If Henry discussed Anne at any point during his demise, Denny or some other attendant could have easily heard it. “Doctors, close assistants who provided personal care, etc. Even possibly spiritual advisors (additional to [Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas] Cranmer) with whom he’d become close over the years,” historian Sandra Vasoli, author of <a href="https://sandravasoli.com/books/anne-boleyns-letter-from-the-tower/" target="_blank"><em>Anne Boleyn’s Letter from the Tower</em></a>, tells Mental Floss. “I’m sure, as well, that since he was lying there knowing he wasn’t getting better, there must have been conversations about his life’s reflection. Did word get around about any statements Henry made about life regrets? Did he, in a personal moment, unburden himself to one of the doctors or friends who attended him? Of course that is very possible, even probable.”</p><p>But Vasoli doesn’t think “several English gentlemen” implies that Henry VIII’s deathbed regret over Anne’s execution was just a rumor Thevet picked up somewhere. “Hey, people talk, but Anne was a sore subject—and not one to be bandied about lightly,” she explains. Moreover, being a well-connected writer from a respected religious order, Thevet likely had better sources for his cosmography than the grapevine. Vasoli thinks he could even have spent time in the <a href="https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/kent/vol2/pp194-198" target="_blank">friary</a> at <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/where-did-king-henry-viii-live-die" target="_blank">Greenwich Palace</a>, where Henry was born and lived for years.</p><h2>Historians Weigh In</h2><p>Though the news of Henry VIII’s purported remorse hardly became common knowledge after <em>La Cosmographie Universelle</em> was published, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Churchman_a_monthly_magazine_in_defe/LhwEAAAAQAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Cosmographie+Universelle+%22Gentilshommes+Anglois%22+%22thevet%22&amp;pg=PA168&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">more than one historian</a> alluded to it in later years. Among them was <a href="https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG149488" target="_blank">White Kennett</a>, an early 18th-century English antiquarian and bishop who mentioned it in his own papers, which Vasoli <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1577522/anne-boleyn-breakthrough-evidence-henry-viii-historian-tudors-history-spt" target="_blank">came across</a> during her own research. Agnes Strickland also brought it up in a volume of her 1840s series <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Lives_of_the_Queens_of_England_from_the/uFVlAAAAcAAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=%22Lives+of+the+Queens+of+England%22+%22thevet%22&amp;pg=PA296&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank"><em>Lives of the Queens of England</em></a>. </p><p>In Strickland’s opinion, the fact that the Franciscans as a whole “had suffered so much for their [steadfast] support” of Catherine of Aragon over Anne Boleyn lent credence to Thevet’s claim. Since he had tacitly gone against the party line by writing “a testimony in favor” of her, his statement “ought to be regarded as impartial history.”</p>

			</figure>
		<p>It’s also not difficult to imagine that Henry VIII would have truly felt sorry for killing someone he once held so dear. He had, after all, written her more than a dozen <a href="https://www.theanneboleynfiles.com/resources/anne-boleyn-words/henry-viiis-love-letters-to-anne-boleyn/" target="_blank">love letters</a> (not to mention that whole business of wrenching the Church of England from Roman Catholic authority in order to be with her).</p><p>“I think Henry was an enormously complex man with widely veering emotions and impulses. I absolutely know that he had adored Anne, and that she loved him back with an incredibly strong connection. Theirs was without doubt a passionate, brilliant, emotional affair,” Vasoli says. As death loomed, he may have revisited their romance and lamented his own role in rather rashly snuffing it—and Anne’s life—out. So while Vasoli admits that “nothing is certain here, by any means,” she, for one, believes that Thevet’s report rings true.</p><p>“Yes, I think Henry had great grief over his rapid execution of Anne, who, I feel certain, was the love of his life,” she says.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/did-henry-viii-regret-executing-anne-boleyn?utm_source=RSS">Did Henry VIII Regret Executing Anne Boleyn?

        <![CDATA[<p>In the 1930s, how would a middle-class Baltimore divorcee become romantically involved with the man who would be King of England? It all comes down to who you know, and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/23545/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-wallis-simpson">Wallis Simpson</a> knew how to climb the social ladder very effectively.</p><p>She started at a young age. While at school, she befriended a member of the Du Pont family. Her stepfather was the son of a prominent Democratic party boss. And during her first marriage to Earl Winfield Spencer, Jr., an alcoholic Navy pilot of no distinction, she had affairs with both an Argentinian diplomat and Mussolini’s future son-in-law.</p><p>Wallis was in the middle of divorcing Spencer when she met Ernest Aldrich Simpson. Ernest was a big step up from her first husband, his father was a co-founder of a successful shipping business, and his brother-in-law had been an MP. While Ernest was born to an American mother and British father, after he graduated college he had renounced his American citizenship. When they met in 1927, Ernest was immediately taken with Wallis, and soon set about divorcing his first wife. The two married a year later and settled in an exclusive area of London.</p><p>Thanks to Ernest’s wealth and connections, the Simpsons traveled in well-heeled circles. Wallis soon became fast friends with Consuelo Thaw and through her met her sister Thelma, Lady Furness. Lady Furness had recently become the mistress of Edward, Prince of Wales, and invited Mr. and Mrs. Simpson to serve as chaperones one weekend in 1931 when the Prince was coming to stay at her country estate, Burrough Court.</p><p>It was not love at first sight for either of them. Edward continued his affair with Lady Furness, although he and Wallis met at various house parties since they traveled in similar circles. It was when his mistress was out of the country in 1934, almost three years to the day after Edward and Wallis met, that they consummated their relationship. He was soon devoted to Wallis and on December 10, 1936, Edward abdicated the throne for her, even though she was still married to her second husband at the time.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30739/how-did-king-edward-viii-meet-wallis-simpson?utm_source=RSS">How Did King Edward VIII Meet Wallis Simpson?</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you been waiting all winter long to get outdoors, feel the sun on your face, and ramble in nature? Someone else, a.k.a. your four-legged bestie, has been yearning to get outside and play, too. </p><p>For <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/dogs">dogs</a>, running around in a yard or park is good for more than just exercise. &#34;With all the sights, sounds, and especially smells, playing outside provides a large amount of mental stimulation as well,&#34; <a href="https://be.chewy.com/getting-to-know-dr-katy-nelson-chewys-resident-veterinarian/" target="_blank">Dr. Katy Nelson</a>, senior veterinarian at Chewy, tells Mental Floss. &#34;It also allows a certain amount of freedom for the pet, as long as it’s in a safe environment.&#34;</p><p>According to Dr. Nelson, how much of a workout your pooch needs will vary based on their age, size, breed, fitness level, and medical conditions. When it comes to choosing a place on land to play with your furry companion, Dr. Nelson says that a fenced-in area is always best. If that’s not an option, choosing an open space away from major roads or other distractions is ideal. </p><p>But most of all, it&#39;s important to give them plenty of fun things to toss around and chew on while they&#39;re playing. “There are lots of great outdoor toys,” says JoAnn Goldsmith, owner of <a href="https://www.pawspetamesbury.com/about" target="_blank">Paws Pet Boutique</a> in Amesbury, Massachusetts. She encourages dog parents to look for high-quality items that are durable and eco-friendly. </p><p>Below are 10 entertaining toys for your dog to enjoy outdoors.

		<p>According to experts, your pet&#39;s size should be a factor when you&#39;re choosing toys. &#34;If a toy is too large, [small dogs] won’t be able to play appropriately,&#34; Dr. Nelson says. Size matters for large breeds too, as &#34;smaller toys can be easily swallowed.&#34; Dr. Nelson recommends Chuckit! brand toys like this one, especially for swimming and fetching, because these durable toys are large enough that they can’t be swallowed.

		<p>Pools are one of the best ways to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/648149/products-help-your-dog-during-summer-heat">keep canines cool</a> while exercising during the warmer months of the year. A pop-up pool like this one is a refreshing option if you don’t live near a beach or lake (or have your own pool). Set up is simple: Just unfold, fill with water, and let the splashing begin. While a pool like this is fine for dogs to romp around in as is, for those that are new to swimming in general, Dr. Nelson recommends putting them in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Outward-Hound-Dawson-Life-Jacket/dp/B01N4CG5BY?&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=mf-outdoor-dog-toys-20&amp;linkId=03cf82c08af589430088207cc307c58a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">lifejackets</a> (particularly if you plan on heading to the beach or any large body of water), as they help pets stay safe while they get more comfortable paddling around. <br/><br/><strong>Buy it: </strong><a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9061814-14324438?sid=mf-outdoor-dog-toys-20&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chewy.com%2Ffrisco-outdoor-dog-swimming-pool%2Fdp%2F282730" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Chewy</a></p><h2>5.

		<p>In addition to thinking about your dog&#39;s size when choosing a toy, Dr. Nelson says it&#39;s also important to consider any physical limitations they might have. “For example, for small dogs with <a href="https://vcahospitals.com/know-your-pet/luxating-patella-in-dogs" target="_blank">luxating patellas</a>, fetch games may not be the best choice, but tug-of-war or swimming might be great.” This bright rope toy is good for tinier breeds and can be used to play tug-of-war.

        <![CDATA[<p>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a trend emerged in English slang for bestowing mock “titles” on people employed or engaged in various jobs or pursuits. So an <a href="https://archive.org/details/slangitsanalogue01farmuoft/page/21/mode/1up?view=theater" target="_blank"><em>admiral of the blue</em></a>,<em> </em>for example, was a publican, so-called because of the color of his apron. A<em> queen of the dripping pan</em> was a cook. A <em>lord of the foresheet</em> was a ship’s cook. And a <a href="https://archive.org/details/slangitsanalogue04farmuoft?view=theater#page/120/mode/1up" target="_blank"><em>knight of the cue</em></a> was a billiard player, a <em>knight of the thimble</em> was a tailor, a <em>knight of the lapstone</em> a cobbler, and a <em>knight of the brush</em> an artist. So what would your job title have been in Victorian slang?</p><h2>1. Waitstaff</h2><p>Barmen were known as <em>aproners</em> and waiters were known as <em>knights of the napkin</em> in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/53673/15-more-excellent-victorian-slang-terms-you-should-be-using">Victorian slang</a>—although if <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JRuNMHNcu5cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=routledge%20historical%20slang&amp;pg=PA1338#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">you waited tables</a> in a pub or tavern you were more likely to be called a <em>dash</em> (derived either from your habit of<em> dashing</em> from table to table, or serving a <em>dash</em> of liquor). Any waiter lucky enough to work outside during the summer months, at garden parties, or in beer gardens and tea gardens, was called a <em>grasshopper</em>.</p><h2>2. Cooks and Chefs</h2><p>A <em>dripping</em> was a (usually fairly poor-quality) chef or cook in 19th-century slang, as was a <em>lick-fingers</em> and a <em>spoil-broth</em>. <em>Gally-swab</em> was another name for a ship’s cook, and a<em> </em><a href="https://archive.org/details/slangitsanalogue04farmuoft/page/31/mode/1up?view=theater" target="_blank"><em>Jack Nasty-face</em></a> was a naval cook or cook&#39;s assistant, probably derived from the earlier use of <em>jack</em> to mean a newly recruited deckhand or sailor.</p><h2>3. Shops and Shopkeepers</h2><p>If you were a general tradesman or shop-worker in Victorian England, then you were a <em>blue-apron</em> or an <em>aproner</em>; a disreputable shopkeeper who cheated his or her customers was known as a <em>tax-fencer</em>. Nicknames for specific shopkeepers included<em> cleaver and kill-calf</em> (a butcher); <em>strap and scraper</em> (a barber); <em>crumb-and-crust-man</em> or <em>bapper and burn-crust</em> (a baker); <em>figgins </em>and <em>split-fig</em> (a greengrocer); and <em>stay-tape</em> and <em>steel-bar flinger</em> (a tailor). The word<em> shopkeeper</em> itself was also used as a nickname for an item of stock that remained unsold for a long time.</p><h2>4. Actors</h2><p>Because Shakespeare was “<a href="https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/the-swan-of-avon" target="_blank">The Swan of Avon</a>,” a <em>swan-slinger</em> was a Shakespearean actor in 19th-century English. Elsewhere, actors were also called <em>tags</em> (from the character names that “tag” the speeches in a script), <em>agony-pilers</em> (particularly those who took on weighty roles), and <em>cackling-coves</em> (literally “chattering-men”).</p><h2>5. Journalists and Writers</h2><p>While a <em>quill-driver</em> or a <em>pen-driver</em> was a clerk or secretary in 19th-century slang, a hack journalist who would take on any work for cash was called an<em> X.Y.Z.</em> after an anonymous writer who used the pseudonym “XYZ” in a mid-1880s <em>Times of London</em> ad offering to work on any project going. Journalists were also known as <em>screeds</em>, <em>pencil-pushers</em>, <em>adjective-jerkers</em>, and <em>chaunter-coves</em>, while a <em>yarn-chopper</em> was a journalist who made up the stories they wrote about.</p><h2>6. The Police</h2><p>Because the London police force <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170301131538/http://content.met.police.uk/Article/The-Metropolitan-Police-how-it-all-began/1400015336362/1400015336362" target="_blank">was established</a> in 1829 by then-Home Secretary (and later Prime Minister) Sir Robert Peel, Victorian police officers became known as <em>peelers</em> and <em>bobbies</em>, terms still in use in Britain today. The peelers’ dark-blue uniforms were also the origin of the old nicknames<em> blue-belly</em>, <em>bluebottle</em>, <em>gentleman in blue and white</em>, and even <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JRuNMHNcu5cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=routledge%20historical%20slang&amp;pg=PA3108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>unboiled lobster</em></a>.</p><h2>7. Lawyers</h2><p>Derived from the earlier use of <em>snap</em> to mean a <em>snare</em> or <em>noose</em>, a <em>brother-snap</em> was an unscrupulous lawyer or <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shyster" target="_blank">shyster</a> in 18th- and 19th-century slang. Lawyers were also known as <em>sublime rascals</em>, <em>tongue-padders</em>, and <em>split-causes</em> (because of their habit of going into lengthy explanatory discourses and nit-picking over every detail), <em>Tom Sawyers</em> (<a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bbcBCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA2280&amp;pg=PA2280#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">in London rhyming slang</a>), and <em>snipes</em>—because they typically presented you with a <a href="https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Wilsons_Snipe/id" target="_blank">very long bill</a>.</p><h2>8. Judges</h2><p>While magistrates were known as <em>beaks</em> in 18th- and 19th-century English (no one quite knows why), judges were <em>nobs-in-the-fur-trade</em> among Victorian criminals. (A <em>nob</em> was a particularly high-ranking or important person, while <em>the fur trade </em>referred to the white fur or ermine used to adorn judges’ robes.)</p><h2>9. Teachers</h2><p><em>Learning-shover</em>, <em>nip-lug</em> (because they pulled on unruly pupils’ ears, or <em>lugs</em>), and <em>terror of the infantry</em> (<em>infantry</em> being a slang name for the pupils of a school) were all old nicknames for schoolteachers in 19th-century English, as was <a href="https://words.fromoldbooks.org/Grose-VulgarTongue/h/haberdasher-of-pronouns.html" target="_blank"><em>haberdasher of pronouns</em></a>. A schoolmaster was a <em>knight of grammar</em>, while a Sunday-school teacher was a <em>gospel-grinder</em>, or a <em>gospel-shark</em>.</p><h2>10. Farmers</h2><p>Probably derived from the Latin word for “ox,” <em>bos</em>, a <em>bosken</em> was a farmhouse in 19th-century slang, and so a farmer was a <em>bos-man </em>or a <em>boss-cockie</em>; a <em>Billy Turniptop</em> was a farmhand or agricultural worker.</p><h2>11. Priests and the Clergy</h2><p>Priests were known as <em>devil-dodgers</em>, <em>men-in-black</em>, <em>mumble-matins</em> (derived from the Matins church service), and <em>joss-house men</em> in 19th-century slang—the latter derived from a pidgin English pronunciation of the Spanish word <em>Dios</em>.</p><h2>12., 13., 14., and 15. Doctors, Pharmacists, Surgeons, and Dentists</h2><p>Both <em>clyster-pipe</em> and <em>squirt</em> are old nicknames for syringes that by the 19th century had come to be used as bywords for anyone employed in dispensing medication. <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=HJxNXRr1NigC&amp;lpg=PA5818&amp;pg=PA5818#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank"><em>Water-scriger</em></a><em> </em>and <em>water-caster</em> were 16th-century words, both still in use in the 1800s, for doctors who diagnosed their patients based on examinations of their urine. Surgeons were known as <em>bone-setters</em> and <em>castor-oil artists</em>, while dentists were <em>fang-fakers</em> and pharmacists and chemists were <em>potter-carriers</em> (a pun on “apothecary”). A chemist’s assistant was a <em>bottle-boy</em>, and a<em> loblolly-boy</em> was a doctor’s assistant.</p><h2>16. and 17. Bankers and Cashiers/Accountants</h2><p>A <em>rag</em> was <a href="http://archive.org/stream/slangitsanalogue05farmuoft#page/360/mode/1up" target="_blank">a banknote</a> in early 19th-century English, and so a <em>rag-shop</em> or a <em>rag-box</em> was a bank, while a <em>rag-shop boss</em> was a banker and a <em>rag-shop cove</em> was a cashier, or someone whose work involved taking and counting money.</p><p><em>A version of this story ran in 2015; it has been updated for 2022.</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/70443/17-job-titles-victorian-slang?utm_source=RSS">17 Job Titles in Victorian Slang</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s an otherworldly experience to stand on a rocky coast and watch a colossal iceberg slowly drift by. This is exactly what locals and visitors along Iceberg Alley experience each year between late April and early June. </p><p>Iceberg Alley refers to the waters of the Atlantic Ocean that run along the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador, in the easternmost point of North America. Here are 11 fascinating facts about the wondrous place. </p><h2>1. The icebergs break off of glaciers in Greenland and travel south. </h2><p>The arrival of springtime means the melting of <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/how-old-glacier-ice" target="_blank">ancient glaciers</a> in the North Atlantic Ocean. As the weather gets warmer, giant swaths of frozen water break off from the <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary/term/ice-shelf" target="_blank">ice shelves</a> and glaciers of Greenland. They then begin a journey south along Iceberg Alley that lasts months from the time they <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary/term/calve" target="_blank">calve</a>—break off from the glacier—until they fully melt into the sea. The icebergs only travel at an average of 0.4 miles per hour, or up to 10 miles a day, but their speeds <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016GL071602" target="_blank">depend on many factors</a> such as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/how-many-oceans-are-there-really">ocean</a> currents, wind, and waves. </p><h2>2. Between 400 to 800 icebergs move past Iceberg Alley every year. </h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBciytKPKyI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Every spring, hundreds of icebergs slowly make their way past Iceberg Alley. They range in size from small chunks called <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary/term/bergy-bit" target="_blank">bergy bits</a> and <a href="https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary/term/growler" target="_blank">growlers</a> to colossal structures that loom over small villages. In 2017, a giant iceberg measuring 150 feet tall went aground near the Newfoundland village of Ferryland, dwarfing all of the homes nearby and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/19/ferryland-iceberg-newfoundland-canada" target="_blank">making headlines around the world</a>. </p><h2>3. Iceberg Alley is where the <em>Titanic</em> sank. </h2><p>There is truth to the expression “the tip of the iceberg,” as only a small portion of an iceberg can be seen above water. The saying is familiar to anyone who knows the story of one of history&#39;s most famous maritime disasters. </p><p>It was in the waters of Iceberg Alley where the ill-fated <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/570490/titanic-ship-facts"><em>Titanic</em></a> collided with an undetected berg. After <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/655410/how-long-did-it-take-the-titanic-to-sink">the ship sank</a> in 1912, Canada, the United States, and with 12 other countries formed the <a href="https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=IIPHistory" target="_blank">International Ice Patrol</a> to warn vessels of any large, frozen obstacles floating around the North Atlantic.  </p><h2>4. The icebergs of Iceberg Alley come in six distinct shapes. </h2><p>As icebergs melt, they take on many different forms, creating magnificent shapes and arches until the last bits fade into the sea. Their various appearances can <a href="https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/trip-ideas/travel-stories/what-shape-do-icebergs-come-in" target="_blank">be categorized</a> into one of six shapes: Blocks are square-shaped icebergs with steep sides and a flat top, while wedges have a flat surface that slopes from one end to the other. Pinnacles are icebergs with, as their name suggests, a pinnacle or peak shape, often referred to as a pyramid. Dry docs are u-shaped icebergs that have a flat water-level section in the middle with two pinnacles or columns on either side. Domes are softly rounded, and tabular icebergs have flat tops with a width much greater than their height. </p><h2>5. The icebergs create vibrant underwater ecosystems in Iceberg Alley.</h2><p>The waters of Iceberg Alley are rich ecosystems that feed whales, seals, and other marine life. This is thanks to the icebergs that break off from the bottom of a glacier, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2017.0176" target="_blank">bringing soil </a>and other <a href="https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2018/base-iceberg-its-big-and-teeming-life" target="_blank">land-based nutrients</a> with them into the sea. The same thing happens when large icebergs scrape the bottom of the ocean—they release the rich nutrients that are trapped on the seafloor. When they melt, the freshwater creates small currents within the salty ocean; these are excellent conditions for <a href="https://oceanbites.org/icebergs-fertilize-phytoplankton-growth/" target="_blank">zooplankton and phytoplankton</a>. The presence of this plankton makes the waters of Iceberg Alley prime feeding grounds for many aquatic animals.</p><h2>6. You can sometimes hear the icebergs break apart. </h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WsMn9fs_5RE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>As an iceberg melts, its weight shifts, creating an imbalance and often forcing it to tip to one side. Sometimes, this even causes the entire iceberg to roll over. The force of the movement can be so great it makes the iceberg explode, sending shards of frozen water into the air. </p><p>The locals compare the sound of this breaking up to the boom of a cannon. You can hear them below the surface, too: For many years, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/B-Veitch/publication/44072675_Field_Observations_of_Iceberg_Deterioration/links/55fbeff908aeba1d9f3a1d35/Field-Observations-of-Iceberg-Deterioration.pdf" target="_blank">researchers have recorded</a> loud underwater noises coming from the moving and melting icebergs.</p><h2>7. You can track the icebergs’ movement along Iceberg Alley.</h2><p>Spring in Newfoundland brings people determined to lay their eyes on one of the colossal ice giants. For anyone interested in iceberg chasing, there’s <a href="https://icebergfinder.com/map" target="_blank">a simple tracker</a> that can help; it lets users locate and trace the movements of the many bergs making their way south. The government of Canada also provides daily updates on the <a href="https://ice-glaces.ec.gc.ca/cgi-bin/getprod.pl?prodid=WIS65&amp;wrap=1&amp;lang=en" target="_blank">presence of icebergs</a> in the area. </p><h2>8. The best way to see the icebergs is to get up close by boat. </h2>

		<p>Many coastal towns—including St. John’s, the capital city of Newfoundland—have boat tours that take visitors close to the icebergs, providing a unique perspective of these ancient, floating blocks of ice. The captains of these vessels are experienced in navigating the tricky waters around icebergs; adventurous types may even choose to <a href="https://hikebiketravel.com/kayaking-in-iceberg-alley-twillingate-newfoundland/" target="_blank">kayak</a> or take a <a href="https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/plan-and-book/tours/34797423" target="_blank">Zodiac</a> out to get a better view. </p><h2>9. Twillingate is the unofficial capital of Iceberg Alley.</h2><p><a href="https://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/canada/newfoundland-and-labrador/central-newfoundland-and-notre-dame-bay/places/twillingate" target="_blank">Twillingate</a> is a small, picturesque fishing village in the Twillingate Islands. It’s unofficially known as the “iceberg capital of the world” for being one of the best spots on the planet to see the glacial monoliths. From Twillingate, you can take one of the boat or kayak tours to get up close to the icebergs. Another option is to hike along the eastern side of <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/canada/newfoundland-and-labrador/spillers-cove-via-twillingates-french-beach" target="_blank">Spiller’s Cove Coastal Trail</a> or walk up to <a href="https://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=1284" target="_blank">Long Point Lighthouse</a> to get the best views of any icebergs adrift at sea. </p><h2>10. You can toast a trip to Iceberg Alley with a drink made from iceberg water. </h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F9Gh8sfDyLk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The people of Newfoundland have found an innovative use for iceberg water—they make <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/02/29/147581630/newfoundland-gives-whole-new-meaning-to-ice-cold-beer" target="_blank">beer</a>, <a href="https://aukislandwinery.com/" target="_blank">wine</a>, and <a href="https://www.iceberg.ca/our-story" target="_blank">vodka</a> with it! Boats trawl the waters around Newfoundland collecting pieces of ice that have broken off. Once collected, it&#39;s melted down and added to select beverages. Toss an <a href="https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/chasing-cold-cash-how-icebergs-became-the-field-of-dreams-for-believers-and-schemers" target="_blank">ice cube from a berg</a> into a drink for some <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=Fcwi9e1fndsC&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=does+iceberg+ice+cubes+fizz?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WMmYXmb82o&amp;sig=ACfU3U3fETvWxh2MNHu5cDEKsUuQH83j9g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhsd-A48j3AhXmhYkEHZPMAjMQ6AF6BAgNEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=does%20iceberg%20ice%20cubes%20fizz%3F&amp;f=false" target="_blank">extra fizz and crackle</a> while taking in the spectacular sights along Iceberg Alley. </p><h2>11. Icebergs aren’t the only things to see along Iceberg Alley. </h2><p>People come for the icebergs, but leave just as impressed by many other beautiful sights found along the coastline of Iceberg Alley, both in the water and on land. Be sure to stop for some famous fish and chips in one of the historic seaside villages and check out Newfoundland&#39;s many historical and cultural <a href="https://www.travelawaits.com/2548919/iceberg-alley-exploring-newfoundlands-avalon-peninsula/" target="_blank">attractions</a>.</p><p>The wildlife viewing is incredible, too: <a href="https://travel.destinationcanada.com/things-to-do/whale-watching-coast-newfoundland" target="_blank"></a>The waters are <a href="https://travel.destinationcanada.com/things-to-do/whale-watching-coast-newfoundland" target="_blank">home to</a> minke, sperm, and humpback whales, and the rocky cliffs abound with seabirds, including the 500,000 Atlantic Puffins who nest at the <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/ecc/natural-areas/wer/r-wbe/" target="_blank">Witless Bay Ecological Reserve</a>. The area is also home to some of the greatest numbers of <a href="https://www.gov.nl.ca/ffa/wildlife/species-tracking/eagle/" target="_blank">bald eagles in North America</a>.  You might even catch sight of a moose—the government estimates that <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-moose-population-decline-dwight-blackwood-1.4120986" target="_blank">110,000 moose</a> inhabit Newfoundland (which is approximately the size of the U.S. state of Tennessee). <br/></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/iceberg-alley-canada-facts?utm_source=RSS">11 Cool Facts About Iceberg Alley</a>. </p>]]>

(<em>Moulin rouge</em> is French for “red mill.”) It promises to be quite the transportive experience. For one thing, the room was developed with the help of Jean-Claude Yon, a social and cultural historian of 19th-century France, who prioritized historical accuracy in his design.</p>

		<p>“The Belle Époque era was a time when French culture and arts flourished—and no landmark is more iconic to that period than the Moulin Rouge,” he said in a <a href="https://news.airbnb.com/the-iconic-moulin-rouge-windmill-reveals-a-secret-room-for-an-overnight-stay-with-airbnb/" target="_blank">news release</a>. “This secret room inside the cabaret’s famous windmill has been designed to take you on an authentic journey back in time to experience the French capital of arts and pleasures during a moment in history.”</p><p>While plenty has changed since the Moulin Rouge first opened its doors in 1889, it still boasts highly entertaining <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/547324/meet-feather-artisans-who-adorn-paris-cabaret-dancers">cabaret</a> performances. The Airbnb guests will not only get to see the current show, <em>Féerie</em>, but also be treated to a private tour of the whole building and a meet-and-greet with lead dancer Claudine Van Den Bergh. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you like your night sky to look like the cover of a 1960s sci-fi novel, you’re in luck. The next total blood <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/moon">moon</a> eclipse is coming this weekend.</p><p><a href="https://moon.nasa.gov/news/172/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-lunar-eclipse/" target="_blank">According to NASA</a>, a lunar eclipse—when the sun, Earth, and moon align and the moon passes into Earth’s shadow—is due May 15 and May 16. It’s a total eclipse, meaning the moon falls into the darkest part of the Earth&#39;s shadow, or <em>umbra</em>, and will appear to have a reddish hue, hence the “blood moon” moniker.</p><p>You could also refer to it as a supermoon, as the moon <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/total-lunar-eclipse-may-15-how-to-watch-rare-super-flower-blood-moon/" target="_blank">will appear larger</a> owing to being closer to Earth in its orbit; some also refer to it as a flower moon because of its appearance in spring, when <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/flowers">flowers</a> are blooming.</p><p>Visibility will depend on where you’re located. Those in the eastern half of the United States and South America will be able to see all stages; the totality can be observed from western Europe, Africa, Central and South America, and most of North America.</p><p>The moon’s colorful appearance is possible because the only light hitting it from the sun will be coming through the Earth’s atmosphere. Blue light scatters, while red light tends to pass through directly.</p><p>The moon is expected to be fully within the umbra beginning at 11:29 p.m. EST on May 15, with the totality beginning to fade around 12:53 a.m. and concluding around 2:50 a.m.</p><p>To see the eclipse, it’s best to try and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67327/11-incredible-stargazing-spots-you-can-visit-summer">view it from a dark area</a> without a lot of bright lighting and minimal clouds. A pair of binoculars or a telescope will help.

      <description>Some downright odd occurrences have happened at the Oscars since the awards show debuted on May 16, 1929. From &#39;La La Land&#39; being named Best Picture when it wasn&#39;t to “Adele Dazeem” and beyond, here are some of the most
        memorable moments in Oscar history.</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Some downright odd occurrences have happened at the Oscars since the awards show debuted on May 16, 1929. Recent events like Will Smith and Chris Rock&#39;s <a href="https://variety.com/2022/awards/news/oscars-will-smith-consequences-chris-rock-1235228010/" target="_blank">headline-making altercation</a> at the 2022 ceremony and the unforgettable 2017 snafu where <em>La La Land</em> was erroneously awarded <em>Moonlight</em>&#39;s Best Picture Oscar might be some of the strangest things to ever happen at the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61782/17-oscar-facts-will-impress-your-party-guests">Academy Awards</a>, but they definitely aren&#39;t the only oddities. </p><h2>1. When Will Rogers didn’t specify which Frank won Best Director.</h2>
			<figure>

			</figure>
		<p>In 1934, Oscar host Will Rogers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/19/the-nine-greatest-oscar-moments-ceremony" target="_blank">revealed</a> the winner of the Best Director award by casually saying “Come up and get it, Frank!” Unfortunately, two Franks had been nominated that night, and <em>Lady for a Day</em> director <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78752/12-screwball-facts-about-frank-capra">Frank Capra</a> had nearly reached the open dance floor before he realized the spotlight had spun around to illuminate the real winner, <em>Cavalcade</em> director Frank Lloyd. Capra would bounce back to win Best Director the following year for <em>It Happened One Night</em>, but he took the loss pretty hard at the time.</p><p>“I wished I could have crawled under the rug like a miserable worm,” he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=t-8mAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22I+wished+I+could+have+crawled%22" target="_blank">wrote in his autobiography</a>. “When I slumped in my chair, I felt like one. All my friends at the table were crying.”</p><h2>2. When Hattie McDaniel became the first Black Oscar winner—and needed special permission to attend the ceremony.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7t4pTNZshA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><br/>When <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/625393/hattie-mcdaniel-missing-oscar-award">Hattie McDaniel</a> was nominated for her unforgettable performance as Mammy in 1939’s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56085/20-things-you-might-not-have-known-about-gone-wind"><em>Gone With the Wind</em></a>, producer David O. Selznick had to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/oscars-first-black-winner-accepted-774335" target="_blank">call in a favor</a> to get the Ambassador’s Cocoanut Grove nightclub to break its &#34;no Blacks&#34; policy and let her attend the ceremony. That favor, however, didn’t secure McDaniel a seat at the table with her fellow cast members. Instead, she sat at a tiny table in the back with her escort and agent, and had to trek a fairly lengthy distance to accept her Best Supporting Actress award later that night.</p><h2>3. When the Oscars ended 20 minutes early and Jerry Lewis had to kill the time.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2riKdGOdU3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>When the final award of the 1959 Oscars <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jerry-lewis-had-fill-20-minutes-time-as-oscar-host-he-delivered-1031732" target="_blank">ceremony</a> was given out a full 20 minutes early and producers scrambled to figure out how to fill the time, co-host Jerry Lewis was left to his own comedic devices. Standing center stage among a sea of presenters and award winners, Lewis announced that they’d be singing 300 choruses of “There’s No Business Like Show Business” before watching a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/550053/facts-about-the-three-stooges"><em>Three Stooges</em></a> program to “cheer up the losers.” He then politely hijacked the conductor’s baton and led the orchestra in song until NBC finally <a href="https://www.oscars.org/oscar/ceremonies/1959/memorable-moments" target="_blank">cut to a sports review show</a> for the rest of the time.</p><h2>4. When Sacheen Littlefeather refused Marlon Brando’s award for him.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2QUacU0I4yU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>When <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/78089/16-fascinating-facts-about-marlon-brando">Marlon Brando</a> was announced as the winner of the Best Actor Oscar for his performance in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/62427/15-things-you-didnt-know-about-godfather"><em>The Godfather</em></a> in 1973, Native American Sacheen Littlefeather refused the award on his behalf and explained that he was boycotting the Oscars to bring attention to the deplorable treatment of Native Americans in the film industry. Her statement was met with a smattering of applause and a chorus of boos, and Brando was criticized for the stunt. It did, however, succeed in drawing attention to the cause, and the trend of politically charged acceptance speeches has only gained popularity since then.</p><h2>5. When a streaker snuck onstage behind David Niven.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWBc-ir6IFM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>In 1974, conceptual artist and photographer Robert Opel <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-flashback-story-behind-streaker-682548" target="_blank">snuck into</a> the Academy Awards ceremony disguised as a journalist and jogged across the stage in his birthday suit, flashing a peace sign and interrupting co-host David Niven. Niven laughed it off, joking, “Well, ladies and gentlemen, that was almost bound to happen,” before introducing presenter Elizabeth Taylor, who admitted it would be a “pretty hard act to follow.”</p><h2>6. When Rob Lowe sang with Snow White.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9mronRVvdmw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>An opening number <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-rob-lowes-snow-white-422225" target="_blank">centered around</a> Snow White singing a rewritten version of “Proud Mary” with her “blind date” Rob Lowe seems like a recipe for confusion at best, and disaster at worst. At the 1989 Oscars, it was both. The long, painful performance baffled the audience, and certain high-profile Hollywood actors—Gregory Peck, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/613339/paul-newman-actor-facts">Paul Newman</a>, and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69347/15-supercalifragilisticexpialidocious-julie-andrews-quotes">Julie Andrews</a>, to name a few—even signed a letter to the Academy condemning the program as “an embarrassment.” On top of that, Disney filed a lawsuit against the Academy for not officially licensing Snow White, though they backed down with a simple apology.</p><h2>7. When Jack Palance’s acceptance speech included push-ups.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGxL5AFzzMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>A genial Jack Palance ambled up to the podium in 1992 to accept his Best Supporting Actor award for <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64732/15-fun-facts-about-city-slickers"><em>City Slickers</em></a> and treated the audience to a demonstration of three one-armed push-ups in the middle of his speech. The 72-year-old actor was attempting to illustrate what casting directors sometimes make younger actors go through during auditions, but the septuagenarian’s impressive athletic feat no doubt made a much bigger impression than anything he said.</p><h2>8. When Tom Hanks seemingly outed his former drama teacher, which inspired the 1997 film <em>In &amp; Out</em>.</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bBuDMEpUc8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69908/16-movies-almost-starred-tom-hanks">Tom Hanks</a> accepted his Best Actor award for <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/568630/philadelphia-movie-facts-tom-hanks-denzel-washington"><em>Philadelphia</em></a> in 1994 by thanking (among others) his former high school drama teacher, Rawley Farnsworth, and calling him one of the “finest gay Americans.” Though many people thought Hanks had accidentally outed Farnsworth, Hanks had actually gotten his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/movies/tom-hanks-philadelphia.html" target="_blank">permission</a> beforehand. Still, the confusion inspired screenwriter Paul Rudnick to create <em>In &amp; Out</em>, a 1997 movie about a closeted teacher (Kevin Kline) whose secret was accidentally disclosed during a former pupil’s (Matt Dillon) acceptance speech.</p><h2>9. When <em>South Park</em>&#39;s creators dressed as Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow.</h2>

		<p>In 2000, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/65262/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-south-park"><em>South Park</em></a> creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone celebrated their Best Original Song nomination (for “Blame Canada” from <em>South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut</em>) by showing up to the Oscars clad in iconic ensembles from other red carpets. Parker rocked a recreation of Jennifer Lopez’s Versace dress from the Grammys earlier that year, and Stone glowed in a low-cut, pale pink number that mirrored Gwyneth Paltrow’s from the 1999 Oscars. The pair <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2016/09/123200/south-park-oscars-acid" target="_blank">later admitted</a> that they took LSD right before the event, but they didn’t mention whether or not drugs were involved when they chose their outfits.</p><h2>10. When John Travolta called Idina Menzel “Adele Dazeem.”</h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DK7gzArTI0w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>If John Travolta had just stumbled through Idina Menzel’s name during his introduction of her performance of “Let It Go” in 2014, we might have simply let it go. However, he quite clearly enunciated a completely different, fictional name, “Adele Dazeem,” which has cemented itself in the minds of anybody who watched the ceremony and many people who didn’t. Menzel exacted good-natured revenge on Travolta at the 2015 Oscars by <a href="https://youtu.be/IiMZyWYU_0E?t=14" target="_blank">calling</a> him “Glom Gazingo.”</p><h2>11. When the “In Memoriam” segment featured a living woman.</h2>

		<p>The 2017 “In Memoriam” segment should’ve been an especially somber affair. Not only did the slideshow feature both Debbie Reynolds and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/90403/30-memorable-quotes-carrie-fisher">Carrie Fisher</a>, but it was backed by Sara Bareilles’s emotional rendition of Joni Mitchell’s “Both Sides Now.” However, it also featured a photo of Australian film producer Jan Chapman—who is still alive—next to the name of costume designer Janet Patterson. Chapman, who worked with Patterson on 1992’s <em>The Last Days of Chez Nous</em> and 1993’s <em>The Piano</em>, said at the time that she was “devastated” by the mistake. “I am alive and well and an active producer,” <a href="https://variety.com/2017/film/awards/oscars-in-memoriam-segment-janet-patterson-wrong-photo-jan-chapman-1201997597/" target="_blank">she told <em>Variety</em></a>.</p><h2>12. When <em>La La Land</em> won Best Picture, and then it didn’t.</h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCQn_FkFElI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The “In Memoriam” error could’ve been the wildest Oscars fail for decades to come, but it was unseated later that same night when presenters Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty announced the wrong winner for Best Picture—and the mistake wasn’t corrected until after the <em>La La Land</em> cast and crew had waltzed onstage, accepted their awards, and delivered heartfelt speeches. Then, <em>La La Land</em> producer Jordan Horowitz declared to a rightfully puzzled audience that <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/92768/moonlight-lowest-budget-film-ever-win-best-picture-oscar"><em>Moonlight</em></a> was the real winner, brandishing the correct results card and repeating “This is not a joke.” We’d later find out that Beatty had accidentally been handed a duplicate envelope for “Best Actress,” which Emma Stone had won for <em>La La Land</em>. (Amazingly, this was far from the first or only time the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/92636/6-times-wrong-winner-was-announced">wrong winner</a> had been announced at a major award ceremony.)</p><p><em>This story originally ran in 2020; it has been updated for 2022.</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/613665/bizarre-oscar-moments?utm_source=RSS">12 Bizarre Moments From Oscar Award Ceremonies Past</a>. </p>]]>

They have to assemble to play or risk getting sued.</p><p>“The plan is to do a sequel that comes out on the 40th anniversary of the original film and I can tell you hardly a day goes by without someone saying, ‘Why don’t you do another one?’” Reiner said. “For so many years, we said, ‘Nah.’ It wasn’t until we came up with the right idea how to do this. You don’t want to just do it, to do it. You want to honor the first one and push it a little further with the story.”</p><p>The onscreen reunion won’t be smooth. “All these years and a lot of bad blood we’ll get into and they’re thrown back together and forced to deal with each other and play this concert,” Reiner added. (His character, director Marty DiBergi, will also reappear.)</p><p><em>This Is Spinal Tap</em> helped birth the faux-documentary genre that was relatively obscure at the time, and some audience members believed they were seeing an actual band implode. (Among those fooled: Ozzy Osbourne.) It won’t be the original movie&#39;s first sequel: For 1992’s <em>Break Like the Wind </em>album, the cast shot new footage for a television special. </p><p>You&#39;ll get another <em>Spinal Tap</em> on March 19, 2024.</p><p><em>[h/t </em><a href="https://deadline.com/2022/05/spinal-tap-sequel-rob-reiner-michael-mckean-christopher-guest-harry-shearer-back-1235022317/" target="_blank"><em>Deadline</em></a><em>]</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/this-is-spinal-tap-sequel-40th-anniversary?utm_source=RSS">Time to Turn It Up to 12: A 'This Is Spinal Tap' Sequel Is Coming</a>. </p>]]>

As Ashoke adapts to the American way of life, Ashima resists the lifestyle and pines to be back home with her family. The story then follows their son Gogol as he struggles between following his family’s tradition or assimilating to U.S. culture—an experience that many first-generation American children deal with.</p><p><strong>Buy it</strong>: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Namesake-Novel-Jhumpa-Lahiri/dp/0618485228/?tag=aapi-books-20" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p><h2>6. <em>Girls Burn Brighter</em> // Shobha Rao</h2>

		<p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/608360/weighted-blankets-science-health-benefits">Weighted blankets</a> have become extremely popular over the years, but Gravity is the brand that really started that trend.

They&#39;re available in blue, white, and gray and come in 15-, 20-, and 35-pound sizes. The brand recommends getting one that’s around <a href="https://support.gravityblankets.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002426252-Which-weight-selection-is-right-for-me-" target="_blank">10 percent</a> of the person’s body weight. So, for example, if your graduate weighs 180 pounds, the 20-pound blanket will probably work best for them. <br/><br/><strong>Buy it: </strong><a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=124578X1585498&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgravityblankets.com%2Fcollections%2Fweighted-blankets%2Fproducts%2Fgravity-blanket&amp;xcust=mf-graduation-gifts" rel="nofollow sponsored" target="_blank">Gravity</a></p><h2>3.

He <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/09/arts/design/warhol-auction-marilyn-monroe.html" target="_blank">based</a> the series on a promotional image of the actress from the 1953 film <em>Niagara</em>. The portraits are identified as “shot” because a woman named Dorothy Podber once entered Warhol’s studio and <a href="https://news.masterworksfineart.com/2019/11/26/andy-warhols-shot-marilyns" target="_blank">fired</a> a gun at a stack of them, leaving a bullet hole in several. (As the story goes, Podber, infamous in the art scene for being unpredictable, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/arts/19podber.html" target="_blank">asked</a> Warhol if she could “shoot” the paintings. Thinking she wanted to photograph them, he agreed. The Christie’s offering was unharmed.)</p><p>The painting was consigned to Christie’s by the estate of Swiss art dealers Thomas and Doris Ammann (the siblings purchased it in 1986) and is considered the highest amount paid for the work of an American artist at auction. (Private sales are another story: another Warhol, <em>Shot Orange Marilyn</em>, fetched $240 million.) </p><p>And if you want to get technical about it, the painting sold for <a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/popculture/warhols-famed-marilyn-silk-screen-sells-record-170-million-auction-rcna28048" target="_blank">$170 million</a>: The extra $25 million includes auction fees.</p><p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-new-york-andy-warhol-c85587e3c17ef8399e11eaff3aca5dc9" target="_blank">previous</a> record holder was for a 1982 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat that nabbed $110.5 million in 2017.</p><p>So who bought it? That is likely to remain a mystery, at least for now. The bids were submitted by an intermediary, leaving the purchaser undisclosed. Some speculated it could be film producer David Geffen or Amazon chair Jeff Bezos, but both have denied it via representatives.</p><p>The transaction may seem like the wildest indulgences of the super-rich, but consider: the proceeds from the sale will be going to fund health care programs for underprivileged children.</p><p><em>[h/t </em><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2022/05/andy-warhol-marilyn-mystery-buyer" target="_blank"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a><em>]</em></p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/andy-warhol-marilyn-monroe-painting-sold?utm_source=RSS">Andy Warhol's Portrait of Marilyn Monroe Sells for $195 Million, Setting an Auction Record for an American Artist</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>These lovable hounds are happy, playful companions. Find out more about why they make perfect <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/pets">pets</a>.</p><h2>1. Their origins are mysterious. </h2><p>The beagle is such an old breed that its ancestors hunted rabbits with <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=W333ciUFP64C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=beagle+ancient+romans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Livx07ht2x&amp;sig=Ezs9MHorwzbCp9j-vx2au3vmpY0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBWoVChMIhcjG4eOFxgIVcEiMCh1fcgDr#v=onepage&amp;q=beagle%20ancient%20romans&amp;f=false" target="_blank">the Ancient Romans</a>. Unfortunately, origins are hard to trace when they stretch that far back. No one is really sure when or where the breed&#39;s ancestors first emerged, but <a href="https://www.nationalbeagleclub.org/History" target="_blank">the beagle as we know it</a> can be traced to the 19th century.</p><h2>2. Pocket beagles predated the ones we know today. </h2><p>Hunters in the 13th century employed <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Beagle_Bible_and_Beagles/QXTLDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=13th+century+pocket+beagle&amp;pg=PT129&amp;printsec=frontcover" target="_blank">pocket beagles</a>, which are exactly as tiny and adorable as they sound. These miniature pups were only about eight inches tall. Today, beagles are about <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/beagle/detail/" target="_blank">13 to 15 inches</a> tall. </p><h2>3. You’ll hear a lot from them. </h2><p>We may not know everything about their origins, but we do know how they got their names. Most likely, <em>beagle</em> comes from the <a href="https://www.cesarsway.com/the-history-of-beagles/" target="_blank">French word <em>begueule</em></a>, which means “open throat.” The name is pretty accurate: Beagles have impressive vocal cords that are much fuller and louder than other dogs. </p><h2>4. Beagles have different barks for different occasions.  </h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/esjec0JWEXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Beagles are so talented at vocalizing, they do so in a few different ways. There’s the <a href="https://hellobark.com/dogs/do-beagles-bark-a-lot/" target="_blank">standard bark</a> for everyday things like alerting when there&#39;s someone at door. Then there’s baying, which sounds a lot like doggy yodeling. This throaty yowl is used on the hunt to alert when they&#39;ve picked up an interesting scent. Finally, there&#39;s the forlorn howl. Beagles <a href="https://beaglecare.com/why-beagles-howl/" target="_blank">will howl </a>if they are sad or bored—or if others are howling first.</p><h2>5. Rabbits need to steer clear. </h2><p>Beagles were bred to be efficient hunting hounds. Their short legs keep them low to the ground, which means they can take in scents without having to stop. <a href="https://www.terrificpets.com/articles/102145665.asp" target="_blank">Big, floppy ears</a> also help them notice smells by wafting them toward the dog&#39;s nose. And their <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/things-you-didnt-know-beagle/" target="_blank">white tipped tails</a> help hunters keep track of the dogs as they run through brush and shrubbery. </p><h2>6. Beagles have powerful noses.</h2><p>The little hounds have some of the best noses in the dog world. With more than <a href="https://thesmartcanine.com/beagle-sense-of-smell/" target="_blank">220 million scent receptors</a>, beagles are basically super-sniffers. A wet nose helps attract and hold scent molecules for better evaluation. Even more impressive: they can differentiate smells and remember them in the future. </p><h2>7. That sense of smell can land them a job. </h2><p>With their powerful noses and portable size, beagles are great working dogs. A common form of employment for beagles is <a href="https://www.voxmagazine.com/magazine/beagles-that-sniff-out-bedbugs/article_84164fba-0cb2-11e6-819c-6b6f15d5d803.html" target="_blank">sniffing out bedbugs</a> (the only silver lining of contracting <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/64296/7-infested-facts-about-bed-bugs">these pests</a> is getting a visit from a pup). Another (slightly) more glamorous job is sniffing polar bear poop: Beagles can <a href="https://www.csmonitor.com/Science/2013/1119/Is-she-or-isn-t-she-Beagle-sniffs-out-polar-bear-pregnancies" target="_blank">smell the droppings</a> of female bears and determine if they are pregnant. </p><h2>8. There’s even a Beagle Brigade. </h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNGdTHxXtLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture decided that beagles are the most effective (and adorable) way to prevent the spread of insects and disease. <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/protecting-agriculture/agriculture-canine" target="_blank">The Beagle Brigade</a> is a trained task force of dogs that patrols airports all over the country. Using their powerful sniffers, the dogs can find meat and produce that might be carrying foreign bugs or diseases. According to <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/meet-the-beagle-brigade/" target="_blank">the American Kennel Club</a>, to become one of these investigative pooches, beagles must undergo 13 weeks of training. </p><h2>9. Beagles are known to roam. </h2><p>Beagles are prone to wanderlust: If they catch a good smell, <a href="https://modernbeagle.com/why-do-beagles-escape/" target="_blank">they’re going to follow it</a>. As a result, you’re going to want to keep your pup on a tight leash. Fenced-in areas might work for some dogs, but many beagles are skilled diggers and climbers.

        <![CDATA[<p>The Greek language is rich and poetic, filled with metaphors and expressive dialogue—a characteristic that dates to antiquity: The ancient Spartans were known for their curt, <a href="https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/unknown.html" target="_blank">understated wit</a>, and the ancient Athenians were said to have “<a href="https://wordsmith.org/words/attic_salt.html" target="_blank">attic salt</a>” (<em>attic</em> referred to the Ancient Greek region of Attica, where Athens was located, and salt was <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=L44mAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA350&amp;lpg=PA350&amp;dq=attic+salt+athenians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lIjEvPmeHr&amp;sig=ACfU3U0i12AwQ1S_W7MO08fkUiSZMYLk8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjrtbSdkqr3AhVrFDQIHYidAYE4ChDoAXoECBIQAw#v=onepage&amp;q=attic%20salt%20athenians&amp;f=false" target="_blank">a metaphor for wit</a>). Today, the modern Greek language still employs sharp, oddly entertaining expressions and phrases—including these idioms you might want to incorporate into daily conversation. </p><h2>1. Grab an Egg and Shave It  (πιάσ’ τ’ αβγό και κούρευ’ το)</h2><p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Pias t’avgo kai kourefto</em></p><p>When someone is faced with an impossible task with no clear solutions, the Greeks say “<a href="https://www.wordsense.eu/%CF%80%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%83%27_%CF%84%27_%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%B3%CF%8C_%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9_%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%85%27_%CF%84%CE%BF/" target="_blank">Grab an egg and shave it</a>.” Obviously, eggs are hairless and can’t be shaved, and that’s exactly the point. There’s no escaping your difficult situation—you might as well try shaving an egg.</p><h2>2. I Write You on My Old Shoes (Σε γράφω στα παλιά μου τα παπούτσια)</h2><p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Se grafo sta palia mou ta papoutsia</em></p><p>It’s said that in the days of the Babylonians, when the king gave a pair of old shoes to a lord with that lord’s name inscribed on the bottom, <a href="https://www.rodiaki.gr/article/366364/se-grafw-sta-palia-moy-ta-papoytsia" target="_blank">the message was unmistakable</a>—the lord was done for, replaced, canceled. The custom passed from the Babylonians to the Byzantines and still makes up part of the Greek lexicon today. If a Greek person tells you they have written someone’s name on the <a href="http://idion.ilsp.gr/lemma/view/805" target="_blank">bottom of their shoes</a>, it means <a href="https://www.amazon.com/lexeis-fraseis-paroimiodeis-Takis-Natsoulis/dp/9602991224/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1650205966&amp;refinements=p_27%3ATakis+Natsoulis&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;text=Takis+Natsoulis" target="_blank">they don’t care about them anymore</a> and they will be ignored from here on out.</p><h2>3. Your Eyes Fourteen (Τα μάτια σου δεκατέσσερα)</h2>

				<figcaption>SimonSkafar // iStock via Getty Images Plus</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p><strong>How It’s Pronounced: </strong><em>Ta matia sou dekatessera</em></p><p>When their kids leave the house, Greek parents will often tell them, “Your eyes fourteen”—the idea being that if you look at situations with 14 eyes instead of two, thus using <a href="https://www.newsbeast.gr/greece/arthro/2179228/pos-vgike-i-frasi-na-chis-ta-matia-sou-dekatessera" target="_blank">all of your senses</a>, you might be able to avoid danger. </p><h2>4. Slowly, the Cabbage (σιγά τα λάχανα)</h2><p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Siga ta lahana</em></p><p>Greeks are quick to use the sarcastic phrase “slowly, the cabbages” when someone is making a big deal out of something unimportant. The expression is said to have originated during the Greek War of Independence, when the tax collectors surprisingly <a href="https://www.newsbeast.gr/greece/arthro/2155336/pos-vgike-i-frasi-siga-ta-lachana" target="_blank">accepted humble cabbages as tithe payments</a>. Today, using the expression indicates that someone is <a href="https://www.wordreference.com/gren/%CE%A3%CE%B9%CE%B3%CE%AC%20%CF%84%CE%BF%20%CF%80%CF%81%CE%AC%CE%B3%CE%BC%CE%B1" target="_blank">giving excessive importance</a> to something that has no value.</p><h2>5. I Ate a Door (έφαγα πόρτα)</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2100,h_1181,x_0,y_113/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/mentalfloss/01g2sy4snck404m5wp6a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="adisa // iStock via Getty Images Plus" alt="a blue door on a yellow building">
				<figcaption>adisa // iStock via Getty Images Plus</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Efaga porta</em></p><p>The Greek expression “I ate a door” is a metaphor for being rejected. If you’re turned down for a job or denied entry to a popular club, one might say a door was slammed in your face—or in other words, “<a href="https://www.slang.gr/lemma/14506-troo-porta" target="_blank">you ate a door</a>.” The phrase is commonly used to describe getting passed over for something that was important to you.</p><h2>6. Should I Sniff My Nails? (να μυρίσω τα νύχια μου)</h2><p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Na miriso ta nichia mou</em></p><p>When the Greeks are asked to predict something, they might reply with, “Should I sniff my nails?”—a quick retort when someone <a href="https://www.athensmagazine.gr/article/social/weird/417018-to-gnwrizate-apo-poy-bghke-h-frash-laquo-tha-myrisw-ta-nyxia-moy-raquo" target="_blank">doesn’t know the answer to a question</a>. It has been suggested by some that the phrase is linked to the Ancient Greek oracles, who used laurel leaves and their oil for divination purposes.</p><h2>7. Sit On Your Eggs (κάτσε στ&#39;αβγά σο)</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2120,h_1192,x_0,y_86/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/mentalfloss/01g2sxtyxb13t16presh.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="SimonSkafar // iStock via Getty Images Plus" alt="A hen sitting on eggs">
				<figcaption>SimonSkafar // iStock via Getty Images Plus</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Kátse st avgá so</em></p><p>A Greek person says “<a href="https://glosbe.com/el/en/%CE%BA%CE%AC%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B5%20%CF%83%CF%84&#39;%20%CE%B1%CE%B2%CE%B3%CE%AC%20%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%85" target="_blank">sit on your eggs</a>” as a warning to someone who is involved in something that doesn’t concern them. In other words, mind your own business and look after your eggs like a well-behaved hen.</p><h2>8. Pops a Donkey (σκάει γάιδαρο)</h2><p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Skaei gaidaro</em></p><p>Donkeys are said to be patient animals that can put up with a lot, so when the Greeks say that someone “<a href="https://www.slang.gr/lemma/13720-skao-gaidaro" target="_blank">pops a donkey</a>,” it means that they’re <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_BHv9DDaneIC&amp;newbks=1&amp;newbks_redir=0&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%B5%CE%B9%20%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BF&amp;pg=PA156#v=onepage&amp;q=%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%AC%CE%B5%CE%B9%20%CE%B3%CE%AC%CE%B9%CE%B4%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%BF&amp;f=false" target="_blank">stubborn to the extreme</a>—so much so that they could break even the most patient of donkeys.</p><h2>9. Black and Spidery (μαύρος κι άραχνος)</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_2820,h_1586,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/mentalfloss/01g2syeht252864j5s4d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Mathieu van den Berk // iStock via Getty Images Plus" alt="A spider on a web">
				<figcaption>Mathieu van den Berk // iStock via Getty Images Plus</figcaption>
			</figure>
		<p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Mavros ki araxnos</em></p><p>The Greeks have many dramatic expressions—so, of course, when they’re referring to something dark and unpleasant, they <em>would</em> say “<a href="https://www.wordsense.eu/%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82_%CE%BA%CE%B9_%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82/" target="_blank">it’s black and spidery</a>.” This phrase can be used in reference to a sad day, someone’s bad attitude, a tragic situation, or a negative feeling surrounding something.</p><h2>10. Acts Like a Duck (κάνει την πάπια)</h2><p><strong>How It’s Pronounced: </strong><em>Kanei tin papia</em></p><p>In the Greek language, when someone “acts like a duck,” it means they’re pretending to be innocent when they’re guilty, <a href="https://www.greekboston.com/learn-speak/idiomatic-expressions/" target="_blank">insist they know nothing</a> of a situation when they’re actually fully aware of it, or just neglect to mention a problem to avoid any consequences. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160520153028/https:/sarantakos.wordpress.com/2016/05/19/papia/" target="_blank">According to a popular folk etymology</a> (of dubious validity), the expression comes from the Byzantine era and refers to <a href="https://archive.org/details/the-oxfrod-dictionary-of-byzantium-vol.-1-oup-1991/The%20Oxfrod%20Dictionary%20of%20Byzantium_Vol.%203_OUP_1991/page/1562/mode/1up?q=papias" target="_blank">the person in charge of palace buildings</a> (known as a Papias). The person who held this position was <a href="https://www.freeopinion.news/Article/13808/kanei-tin-papia-giati-to-leme-kai-ti-simainei" target="_blank">considered untrustworthy</a> and allegedly spied, lied, and accused others while pretending he was innocent. According to some versions of the story, as the years went on, <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-this-Greek-words-k%C3%A1ni-ti-p%C3%A1pia" target="_blank">pronunciation shifted</a>, turning the Byzantine Papias (which etymologically is related to the word for father) into the modern Greek for duck. Today, if someone is acting ignorant and pretending not to know something, they will be <a href="https://www.freeopinion.news/Article/13808/kanei-tin-papia-giati-to-leme-kai-ti-simainei" target="_blank">called out</a> as a “duck.” </p><p> </p><h2>11. You Drown Yourself in a Teaspoon of Water (πνίγεσαι σε μια κουταλιά νερό)</h2>

		<p><strong>How It’s Pronounced:</strong> <em>Pnígese se mia koutalia nero</em></p><p>This Greek proverb is often used to describe someone who is overly dramatic and who makes a <a href="https://glosbe.com/el/en/%CF%80%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B3%CE%BF%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%B9%20%CF%83%CE%B5%20%CE%BC%CE%B9%CE%B1%20%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%84%CE%B1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%AC%20%CE%BD%CE%B5%CF%81%CF%8C" target="_blank">big deal out of small concerns</a>.

        <![CDATA[<p>The Masters Tournament, which is held each year during the first full week of April at Georgia&#39;s famed <a href="https://www.augusta.com/" target="_blank"><u>Augusta National Golf Club</u></a>, is one of just four globally recognized major championships in professional golf. (The others being the PGA Championship, the U.S. Open, and The Open Championship). </p><p>Typically referred to simply as &#34;The Masters,&#34; this prestigious competition has some interesting history, protocols, and traditions that go far beyond golf to include everything from green sports jackets to pimento cheese sandwiches. Read on to learn more.</p><h2>1. The Green Jacket tradition started in 1937.</h2><p>The origins of The Green Jacket—a single-breasted, brass-buttoned, green sports jacket that is now bestowed upon each year&#39;s winner—date back to 1937. The idea behind the iconic piece of clothing, <a href="https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/sports/pga/2021/04/10/the-masters-golf-tournament-green-jacket-facts-champions-winners/7154516002/" target="_blank">according to <em>The Augusta Chronicle</em></a>, originated as a way for non-members who might have a question or need guidance to easily identify official club members who could offer them assistance. For more than a decade, the only people who were allowed to wear the now-famous Green Jacket were Augusta National Golf Club members.</p><h2>2. The first Masters Green Jacket was handed out in 1949.</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>While members of the Augusta National Golf Club began proudly wearing their jackets in the mid-1930s, it wasn&#39;t until a dozen years later that the first Masters champion took one home as part of the tournament&#39;s prize. In 1949, golfer Sam Snead became the first Masters champion to be gifted with a Green Jacket. So that no previous winners felt left out, the <a href="https://www.pga.com/story/masters-green-jacket-history-and-facts" target="_blank">PGA reports</a> that they were then sent out to all earlier Masters champions, too.</p><h2>3.  The jacket wasn&#39;t always very practical, or comfortable.</h2><p><a href="https://www.pga.com/story/masters-green-jacket-history-and-facts" target="_blank">According to the PGA</a>, the original Green Jackets were a little uncomfortable. The first jackets, which were crafted by Brooks Uniform Co. in New York, were made of a heavy wool material that didn&#39;t quite lend itself to the links. Today, the jackets are made of a tropical-weight wool that&#39;s sourced locally, from the Forstmann Company in Dublin, Georgia, just about 100 miles away.</p><h2>4. The Green Jacket comes with some rules.</h2>

		<p>For as iconic an item of clothing as it is, you won&#39;t often see a Masters Green Jacket out in the wild. That&#39;s because, as <a href="https://www.augustachronicle.com/story/sports/pga/2021/04/10/the-masters-golf-tournament-green-jacket-facts-champions-winners/7154516002/" target="_blank"><em>The Augusta Chronicle</em> writes</a>, &#34;jackets are kept on club grounds, and taking them off the premises is forbidden.&#34; The only exception is for the Masters winner, who is allowed to take their jacket home for one year, then must be returned to the Club.</p><p>If you want to see the jacket up close, there&#39;s one on display at the <a href="https://www.augustamuseum.org/CelebratingaGrandTradition" target="_blank"><u>Augusta Museum of History</u></a>.</p><h2>5. Cell phones are prohibited.</h2><p>Don’t think you can take a quick selfie or shots of the action at the Masters—unless you want to risk getting kicked out of the event. The Club&#39;s <a href="https://www.augusta.com/masters/dos_donts#:~:text=Cell%20phones%2C%20beepers%20and%20other,Monday%2C%20Tuesday%2C%20Wednesday)." target="_blank"><u>rules</u></a> strictly prohibit the use of cell phones, beepers, or any other electronic devices on the grounds at all times. </p><p>If you need to make a call, you’ll have to be old-school about it. The club sets up stands of <a href="https://golf.com/news/masters-no-phones-no-problem-at-augusta-national/" target="_blank"><u>stationary phones</u></a> to use.</p><h2>6. Cameras are also a no-no.</h2><p>Cameras have a little bit of leeway: They&#39;re allowed during practice rounds, which fall on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of the week of the Masters.

		<p>The Augusta National Golf Club has had many significant members, including 34th POTUS Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower was a friend of <a href="https://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/2019-03-28/dwight-d-eisenhowers-influence-augusta-national-remembered" target="_blank"><u>Masters chairman Clifford Roberts</u></a>, who co-founded the Masters Tournament with famed golfer Bobby Jones. </p><p>As legend has it, Eisenhower had a major problem with a certain pine tree at Augusta, which he claimed impacted his game and asked to have removed. The conifer, which came to be known as the “<a href="https://golf.com/news/masters-2015-eisenhower-tree-finds-a-new-home/" target="_blank">Eisenhower Tree</a>,” was located on the 17th hole, stood 65 feet high, and was believed to be more than 100 years old. While it&#39;s no longer there, it&#39;s not because of Ike&#39;s complaints: The tree sustained severe damage in February 2014, when a rare ice storm descended on Augusta, and had to be removed. </p><p>There is, however, a <a href="https://www.liveabout.com/tour-the-famous-landmarks-at-augusta-national-4056176" target="_blank"><u>pond on the course</u></a> named after Eisenhower.</p><h2>8. Pimento cheese sandwiches are a Masters tradition.</h2><p>The food and drink menu at the Masters has options that are not only beloved, but also surprisingly <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/masters-food-pimento-cheese-sandwich-prices-augusta-national-2019-4" target="_blank"><u>budget-friendly</u></a>. According to a <em>GolfWeek</em> article, the tournament introduced a <a href="https://golf.com/lifestyle/food/masters-new-chicken-salad-sandwich/" target="_blank"><u>chicken salad sandwich</u></a> on brioche bread in 2021 that was priced at just $3. The entry joined other items such as chocolate chip cookies, an egg salad sandwich, and their famous <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNaO91FAuwt/" target="_blank"><u>pimento cheese</u></a> sandwich. This cheesy spread on bread is typically credited to the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/06/the-masters-golf-augusta-pimento-cheese-sandwich-nick-rangos-2016"><u>Nick Rangos</u></a>, a caterer who put them together for the Masters for over four decades.</p><h2>9.

		<p>Between the Green Jackets and the golf course itself, there&#39;s a lot of green to be seen at the Masters. This color trend carries over into the food options, with beverages typically being served in green cups and sandwiches and snacks wrapped in green paper. <a href="https://365atlantatraveler.com/things-you-probably-dont-know-about-the-masters/" target="_blank">The reason</a>?

In 2018, <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkCalc/status/980773963138846720?s=20&amp;t=6r2K3iXUVkVxZcRo9uE05g" target="_blank">Mark Calcavecchia tweeted</a> that he and Ken Green are the ones who started this tradition back in 1987—and got in trouble for it.

The piano-and-guitar-based tune is called “Augusta” and was created by <a href="https://www.golfmonthly.com/tour/us-masters/masters-theme-song-193159" target="_blank"><u>American singer-songwriter Dave Loggins</u></a>. He is a cousin of fellow songwriter, Kenny Loggins. Kenny, coincidentally, wrote  &#34;I&#39;m Alright&#34;—the theme song for legendary golf comedy <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/556975/caddyshack-mistakes-things-to-look-for"><em>Caddyshack</em></a> (1980).</p><p>Dave visited the Augusta National Golf Club in the early &#39;80s and is said to have been inspired to compose “Augusta” while being at the course’s 14th hole. The song first aired during the 1982 Masters, and it even has <a href="https://thegolfnewsnet.com/lyrics-masters-theme-song-augusta-dave-loggins/" target="_blank"><u>lyrics</u></a>. In 2001, Loggins changed a line in honor of Tiger Woods.</p><h2>12. Each tournament begins with a ceremonial opening drive.</h2><p>Beginning in 1963, each Masters begins with a guest from its past when a <a href="https://www.augusta.com/masters/photos/masters-tournament-honorary-starters-rare-honor" target="_blank"><u>veteran golfer</u></a> hits a ceremonial opening drive to signify the start of another tournament.

		<p>Plants and flowers have always been an important part of the Masters. The location of the Augusta National Golf Club was once the location of Fruitland Nurseries, a large-scale horticultural site founded in 1858. The property was sold in 1931 and quickly transformed into the Augusta National Golf Club.</p><p>Today, each <a href="https://golf.com/news/features/every-hole-augusta-national-explained-masters-champ/" target="_blank"><u>hole on the golf course</u></a><u> </u>at the Masters is named for a plant, tree, flower, or shrub embellishing it. For example, Hole No. 1 is referred to as <a href="https://www.masters.com/en_US/news/articles/2018-04-06/2018-04-06_tea_olive_a_challenging_first_hole.html" target="_blank"><u>Tea Olive</u></a>, while the 18th hole <a href="https://www.masters.com/en_US/course/hole18.html" target="_blank">features a holly tree</a>.  </p><p>Yet the most noteworthy plantings are the azaleas. <a href="https://www.augusta.com/masters/story/news/2020-10-25/azaleas-are-augusta-nationals-most-famous-plantings" target="_blank"><u>More than 30 varieties of this flowering shrub</u></a> can be found around the course. The 13th hole is also referred to as “Azalea.”  </p><h2>14. Women weren&#39;t admitted to Augusta until 2012.</h2><p>For a long time, the Augusta National Golf Club was a men’s club. In 2012, the club welcomed its <a href="https://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/8284599/augusta-national-admits-condoleezza-rice-darla-moore-first-two-female-members" target="_blank"><u>first two female members</u></a>: former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and business executive Darla Moore. </p><p>Women golfers now also take the course a week before the Masters, in the <a href="https://www.anwagolf.com/index.html" target="_blank"><u>Augusta National Women&#39;s Amateur Championship</u></a>. The championship began in 2019 and marks its third year in 2022; the 2020 edition was canceled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, The Masters was <a href="https://www.masters.com/en_US/news/articles/2020-04-06/2020_masters_targeting_november_915.html?promo=hero_articles_2020MastersTargetingNovember9-15" target="_blank">held in November</a> due to coronavirus concerns.

        <![CDATA[<p>In hindsight, Celine Dion’s “My Heart Will Go On,” the love theme from James Cameron’s 1997 film <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66669/10-unsinkable-facts-about-titanic"><em>Titanic</em></a>, seems—like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/570490/titanic-ship-facts">a certain boat</a>—too big to fail. It’s a big emotional ballad sung with maximum power and precision by the day’s leading practitioner of such things. And yet, there were a number of factors, including Dion’s initial dislike of the song, that nearly played iceberg and prevented this definitive ’90s pop-culture moment from happening. But fate wanted the world to have this song.</p><h2>Titanic Pressure</h2>

		<p>Prior to <em>Titanic</em>, filmmaker James Cameron was known for sci-fi fare like <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/66603/14-things-you-might-not-know-about-aliens"><em>Aliens</em></a>, <em>The Abyss</em>, and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/65746/25-indestructible-facts-about-terminator">the Terminator series</a>. But after watching a documentary on <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/546564/how-cold-war-mission-led-discovery-titanic">Robert Ballard’s 1985 discovery</a> of the wreck of the RMS <em>Titanic</em>—which famously sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912, <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/common-rms-titanic-questions-answered">killing approximately 1500 people</a>—Cameron resolved to make a movie about the doomed ocean liner. It wound up being a massive undertaking, and when <em>Titanic</em> finally hit theaters in December 1997, it was $100 million over budget and six months late.</p><p>There are different theories as to why Cameron included a modern pop song at the end of his period drama, even though he was staunchly against the idea. Speaking to <em>Billboard</em> for a “My Heart Will Go On” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/features/celine-dion-my-heart-will-go-on-oral-history-interview-7800213/" target="_blank">oral history</a> in 2017, former Sony Music boss Tommy Mottola suggested Cameron was pressured by the film studio to provide an “additional powerful marketing tool,” as some <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/titanic-movie-flop-history-facts">feared the movie would be a flop</a>. <em>Titanic</em> executive producer Jon Landau refuted this claim, insisting that Cameron was always <em>willing</em> to consider a pop song. The director simply didn’t think one would fit into his “very dramatic, historical drama.”</p><p>Unbeknownst to the film’s producers, <em>Titanic</em> composer James Horner had already begun writing a song for the end credits. It incorporated elements of his score and promised to fit seamlessly into the movie. He recruited Will Jennings, with whom he’d worked on other film projects, to write the lyrics. Horner told Jennings the movie centered on the character of Rose DeWitt Bukater, a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/647647/watch-titanic-survivors-tell-their-stories-rare-video"><em>Titanic</em> survivor</a> looking back on a love affair decades later. </p><p>Cameron <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/03/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-beatrice-wood-a-titanic-figure-of-the-avant-garde.html" target="_blank">partly drew inspiration</a> for Rose from <a href="https://americanart.si.edu/artist/beatrice-wood-5468" target="_blank">Beatrice Wood</a>, an artist nicknamed the &#34;Mama of Dada,&#34; whose autobiography the director was reading during <em>Titanic</em>&#39;s development. Though Wood was not a <em>Titanic </em>passenger, she, like Rose, had a deep passion for art. She had studied in Paris before World War I and lived an incredible life. In order to gain a better understanding of Cameron&#39;s inspiration, Jennings met with Wood, who was then 103 years old and still working. </p><p>“When she shook my hand, I had such a feeling of vitality and life force—it was like nothing in my life before or since,” Jennings <a href="https://www.songfacts.com/facts/celine-dion/my-heart-will-go-on" target="_blank">told Songfacts</a>. Using Wood’s story as a stand-in for Rose’s, Jennings came up with “My Heart Will Go On,” a song about resilience and eternal love. With the music and lyrics in place, Horner and Jennings now just needed someone to sing the darn thing.</p><h2>Single-Take Celine</h2><iframe width="360" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z82y9DtJHMk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Horner and Jennings had worked together on the 1991 animated feature <em>An American Tail: Fievel Goes West</em>, and they tapped Celine Dion to sing the demo version of “Dreams to Dream,” a song they ultimately gave to Linda Ronstadt, who was then a bigger star. By 1997, Dion had scored a couple of massive soundtrack hits—including “Beauty and the Beast,” the title track from the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/61878/15-enchanting-facts-about-beauty-and-beast">1991 Disney movie</a>, and “Because You Loved Me,” from Jon Avnet&#39;s <em>Up Close &amp; Personal</em>—and blossomed into a pop heavyweight. Jennings says Dion was always their top choice to sing “My Heart Will Go On,” but when Horner first played her the song on piano in her Las Vegas hotel suite, she wasn’t impressed. </p><p>According to Dion, Horner (who died in a plane crash in 2015) wasn’t a great singer, so he didn’t do the best job of selling his song. Beyond that, Dion didn’t want to record <em>another</em> movie theme. While Horner played, she mouthed “I don’t want to do that song” to her husband and manager, René Angélil. </p><p>Perhaps sensing the song’s potential, Angélil stopped Horner’s performance and agreed to have Dion record a demo. The Canadian superstar was not pleased, and when she arrived in New York City to lay down vocals a few weeks later, she was feeling even worse. “I have belly pains,” she told <em>Billboard</em>. “My girly days are starting to happen.” After Horner gave Dion a quick summary of the <em>Titanic</em> plot, the singer dimmed the lights and stepped into the vocal booth. Moved by the story and buzzing from black coffee, which sped up her vibrato, Celine nailed the song in a single take. </p><p>“Everybody started to cry, and I got caught by the emotion as well, by the story of the movie and the whole thing,” Dion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z82y9DtJHMk" target="_blank">said in a TV interview</a>. Mottola remembers getting chills. Session co-producer Simon Franglen made a rough mix to play for a skeptical Cameron, and Horner carried around a cassette for weeks, waiting to catch the director in a good mood. Cameron ultimately went for the song, and when he screened the film—complete with “My Heart Will Go On”—for Dion and Angélil, Celine cried her eyes out.</p><h2>Ruling the Radio</h2>

		<p>Dion has claimed that she never recorded “My Heart Will Go On” again, but there’s some debate over whether this is true. When it came time to release the song as a radio single, Dion’s label enlisted producer Walter Afanasieff to transform the pared-down film version—Dion’s initial demo—into something bigger and bolder. “To be very honest, I didn’t really get it,” Afanasieff told <em>Billboard</em>. “I thought it was a very simple song that just meandered. It was a little dreary.”</p><p>Afanasieff arranged and produced the new version, adding strings, thundering drums, and electric guitar. He also claims to have re-recorded Celine’s vocals. “I can’t agree to all of these other cockamamie, one-take stories,” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/features/celine-dion-my-heart-will-go-on-oral-history-interview-7800213/" target="_blank">he said</a>. Dion’s longtime producer John Doelp maintains that the singer was in New York working on her album <em>Let’s Talk About Love</em> while Afanasieff was doing his thing, so she couldn’t have taken another vocal pass.</p><p>Either way, the souped-up “My Heart Will Go On” didn’t explode onto the radio straight away. It landed in early December 1997, before the movie came out, and it struck some Top 40 programmers as too “adult contemporary” for their playlists. The label even considered <em>not</em> releasing the song as a commercial single—a move that would have disqualified it from making the Billboard Hot 100, America’s premier pop chart. But when <em>Titanic</em> hit theaters and became a phenomenon, airplay went through the roof. </p><p>In February 1998, the song set a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Eg8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;dq=%22reaching+the+largest+radio+audience%22+and+%22my+heart+will+go+on%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s0y0bi1epg&amp;sig=ACfU3U3ZQB-xGmuqY_FljsxiNzVFFGc1PA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjBqaHx96_3AhVuj4kEHSLEAi0Q6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22reaching%20the%20largest%20radio%20audience%22%20and%20%22my%20heart%20will%20go%20on%22&amp;f=false" target="_blank">record</a> for &#34;reaching the largest radio audience&#34; up to that point—and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. By then, the <em>Titanic</em> soundtrack had already begun its 16-week run atop the Billboard 200 album chart. The LP has since been certified 11 times platinum in the U.S. and sold some 30 million copies worldwide. This was a major win for Sony, as the label had paid a mere $800,000 for the rights to the soundtrack back in 1996, before Dion was attached, and it was just going to be the film score.</p><p>“My Heart Will Go On” was also included on Dion’s album <em>Let’s Talk About Love</em>, so naturally, that LP reached No. 1, too. All told, “My Heart Will Go On” has sold more than 18 million copies globally. The song also dominated both the 1998 and 1999 award seasons, earning the Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Original Song, as well as four Grammys: Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. </p><p>At the Grammys, Afanasieff met Horner for the first time, even though both men are credited as producers on the song&#39;s blockbuster radio version. Afanasieff was miffed about sharing credit since, in his mind, he’d remade the track completely by himself. “I don’t wish to speak ill of someone who passed away,” <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/features/celine-dion-my-heart-will-go-on-oral-history-interview-7800213/" target="_blank">Afanasieff told <em>Billboard</em></a>, nearly two years after Horner’s untimely death, “but that was a very hard pill to swallow.”</p><h2>The Song Will Go On</h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fGU7NMxboNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>In the decades since, Dion has continued blowing minds and making audiences weep with her live renditions of “My Heart Will Go On.” In 2017, she marked the song’s 20th anniversary with a performance at the Billboard Music Awards. The song took on added significance shortly before her husband’s death in January 2019 after a long battle with cancer. As he lay in bed, nearing the end of his life, Angélil reportedly <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7718051/Celine-Dion-reveals-performed-Heart-fulfill-dying-husbands-wish.html" target="_blank">longed to see Dion sing</a> the <em>Titanic</em> song from the stage of her Las Vegas residency. Dion live-streamed the show to his room. “It wasn’t therapeutic for me,” she said. “It was therapeutic for René.”</p><p>As expected, YouTube is brimming with “My Heart Will Go On” covers—the most spectacular of which might be 9-year-old Celine Tam’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-2NWzdenFU" target="_blank">showstopping rendition</a> on <em>America’s Got Talent</em> in 2017. YouTube is also a good place to find a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c19Q9wB8v6Y" target="_blank">supercut of sports highlights</a> set to the part in the song where Celine changes key for the final chest-beating chorus. </p><p>The song’s legacy even extends to the suburbs of Auckland, New Zealand, where Pasifika youth in the <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/127665492/celine-dion-siren-battlers-return-to-west-auckland-locals-at-breaking-point" target="_blank">“siren kings” subculture</a> have taken to blasting “My Heart Will Go On” during battles to see who has the loudest, clearest homemade loudspeaker system. The song is perfectly suited to these sonic skirmishes because of its crisp, pure sound. It rings out near, far, wherever you are.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/my-heart-will-go-on-titanic-theme-complicated-history?utm_source=RSS">How Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On,' a Song No One Wanted, Became a Titanic Hit</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>For Christmas dinner in December 1870, the Paris restaurant Voisin publicized a <a href="https://www.ripleys.com/weird-news/zoo-feast-a-christmas-dinner-for-the-ages/" target="_blank">menu</a> that careened well past the limits of adventurous gastronomy. Among the entrées were kangaroo stew, elephant stock, stuffed donkey head, and bear chops roasted with pepper sauce.</p><p>The protein on Chef Alexandre Étienne Choron’s line-up was courtesy of the Jardin d’Acclimatation, a Paris zoo that had sold its menagerie to the restaurant. This unfortunate turn of events arose from wartime desperation, which had led to food supplies being cut off and residents turning to extreme measures.</p><p>In order to survive, Paris would have to eat its zoos.</p><h2><strong>An Unrestricted Diet</strong></h2>

		<p>The dark chapter in the city’s otherwise renowned food history <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/paris-siege-eating-zoo-animals" target="_blank">began</a> in September 1870, when German forces aligned with Prussia to seal off Paris during the Franco-Prussian War. When Emperor Napoleon III attempted to move against Prussia, he was captured—leaving Paris vulnerable. That&#39;s when the Germans decided the best way to take control of the city was to effectively starve its residents into submission by cutting off its supply lines. By the time the siege was complete, railroads and telegraph lines had been interrupted, turning Paris&#39;s occupants into unwitting prisoners.</p><p>Henry Labouchère, a French news liaison for England, was on location when the siege began and wound up becoming a  war correspondent. Of Paris’s mood, he <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=m8SIDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT67&amp;lpg=PT67&amp;dq=Yesterday,+I+had+a+slice+of+Pollux+for+dinner.+Pollux+and+his+brother+Castor+are+two+elephants,+which+have+been+killed.+It+was+tough,+coarse,+and+oily&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kLBAz7x6W3&amp;sig=ACfU3U0ydY9m_mdAXSFREGuQLIjIYII7iw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwix6vj3koD2AhXFUt8KHdAlAO4Q6AF6BAgnEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=Yesterday%2C%20I%20had%20a%20slice%20of%20Pollux%20for%20dinner.%20Pollux%20and%20his%20brother%20Castor%20are%20two%20elephants%2C%20which%20have%20been%20killed.%20It%20was%20tough%2C%20coarse%2C%20and%20oily&amp;f=false" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p><p><em>“Paris, once so gay, has become as dull as a small German capital. Its inhabitants are not in the depths of despair, but they are thoroughly bored. They are in a position of a company of actors shut up in a theatre night and day, and left to their own devices, without an audience to applaud them or to hiss at them.&#34;</em></p><p>The most pressing problem was not boredom but sustenance: The Germans hoped a starving Paris would be a compliant Paris. The Ministry of Agriculture had stocked up on livestock while they could, but the supply quickly dwindled.</p><p>Hoping to ration the remaining cattle, Parisian officials allowed food markets to begin selling the meat of domesticated cats and dogs as well as <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/horse-meat/529665/" target="_blank">horse meat</a>, a lean protein high in healthy fats that was a common source of food in the 19th century (though it’s generally never been part of  America&#39;s diet).</p><p>The city couldn’t afford to be selective with a horse’s byproducts, either. Horse blood was used to make pudding. The meat was braised, boiled, and turned into soup.</p>

			</figure>
		<p>Labouchère was one of the individuals sampling the equestrian eats. “I dine habitually at a bouillon,” he wrote. “There horseflesh is eaten in place of beef, and a cat is called <em>rabbit</em>. Both, however, are excellent, and the former is a little sweeter than beef, but in other respects much like it; the latter something between rabbit and squirrel, with a flavor all its own. It is delicious. I recommend those who have cats with philoprogenitive proclivities, instead of drowning the kittens, to eat them. Either smothered in onions or in a ragout they are excellent.”</p><p>Labouchère was, in fact, seemingly delighted in how events had revealed to him the pleasures of taboo dining, becoming something like the Guy Fieri of donkey soups.</p><p>“This siege will destroy many illusions, and among them the prejudice which has prevented many animals being used as food. I can most solemnly assert that I never wish to taste a better dinner than a joint of donkey or a ragout of cat—trust me.”</p><p>As many as 65,000 to 70,000 horses were consumed during the Siege of Paris. But that wasn’t enough to satisfy the collective appetite of a city walled off from food supplies.</p><p>In some ways, it was perhaps inevitable that eyes would turn toward a most plentiful supply of meat that could be found virtually everywhere in Paris: <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86940/11-beady-eyed-facts-about-rats">rats</a>. The animals were considered a bit of a delicacy—while some Parisians opted for cat or dog at 20 to 40 cents per pound, rat meat fetched 50 cents. </p><p>Despite the cost, there was a kind of stigma surrounding ingestion of the pets and rodents. “In the rue Blanche there is a butcher who sells dogs, cats and rats,” Labouchère wrote. “He has many customers, but it is amusing to see them sneak into the shop after carefully looking around to make sure that none of their acquaintances are near.”</p><p>Labouchère added that, of dog dishes, poodle was reputed to be best. Bulldogs, however, were “coarse and tasteless.”</p><h2><strong>Elephant in the Dining Room</strong></h2>

		<p>As the siege entered its fourth month and residents continued to become acclimated to alternative dietary choices, the zoos in the city were running low on feed for the elephants, donkeys, kangaroos, peacocks, and other animals that populated their grounds. So zoo animals that were no longer sustainable became a resource for the city’s few open restaurants.</p><p>This was how patrons were given menus like the one from Voisin, with its elaborate preparations of zoo attractions. (One could still, however, get the filet of mule or dog cutlets.) Not even Castor and Pollux, a famed elephant duo, were spared; their trunks commanded the highest prices.</p><p>Making the best of a horrific situation, Parisians seemed to consider the ingestion of these respected animals a kind of cultural milestone, though not much of a dining experience: The meat frequently had to be cooked over a lamp due to a lack of fuel.</p><p>“Yesterday, I had a slice of Pollux for dinner,&#34; Labouchère wrote. “Pollux and his brother Castor are two elephants from the zoological gardens, which have been killed. It was tough, coarse and oily, and I do not recommend English families to eat elephant as long as they can get beef and mutton.”</p><p>It’s <a href="http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2018/02/time-parisians-ate-zoo-elephants/" target="_blank">believed</a> that only lions, tigers, hippos, and monkeys were left alone, owing either to the difficulty in killing them or a guilt in the fact monkeys had qualities similar to humans.</p><p>The Prussians finally breached Paris in January 1871 by lobbing shells into the city, resulting in more than 400 casualties and, ultimately, Paris’s surrender. The Franco-Prussian War ended a few months later, though one imagines the memory of roast ostrich would linger for quite some time.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/paris-siege-eating-zoo-animals?utm_source=RSS">'I'll Have the Kangaroo Stew': When Paris Was Forced to Eat Its Zoos</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1979, the United States came the closest it’s ever been to a commercial nuclear catastrophe.</p><p>A malfunctioning valve led to a partial meltdown in one of the two reactors at the nuclear power plant on <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/27250/meltdown-three-mile-island-documentary">Three Mile Island</a>, a small island located in Lake Frederic, a reservoir in the Susquehanna River, just about 10 miles downriver from <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/73887/25-key-facts-about-pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>’s capital of Harrisburg. Fortunately, catastrophe was avoided.</p><p>The Three Mile Island accident has been overshadowed by more severe nuclear meltdowns at <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/55494/16-spooky-hell-photos-inside-chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> in 1986 and <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/611559/fukushima-nuclear-disaster-site-wildlife-thriving">Fukushima</a> in 2011, but the effects of Three Mile Island have reverberated for decades since, from <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html" target="_blank">changes</a> in U.S. energy policies to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/pop-culture">popular culture</a>. Now, a new four-part <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/541195/best-docuseries-you-can-stream-netflix">docuseries</a> about the incident, <em>Meltdown: Three Mile Island</em>, will <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81198239" target="_blank">premiere on Netflix</a> on May 4, 2022.</p><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nAOIH8HRdDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>With that in mind, here are some important facts to know about the Three Mile Island accident.</p><h2>1. There were two nuclear reactors on Three Mile Island. </h2><p>Construction began on Three Mile Island&#39;s first nuclear reactor, TMI-1, on <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/analysis/farewell-to-three-mile-island" target="_blank">May 18, 1968</a>—a full decade after America&#39;s first commercial nuclear plant, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Shippingport-Atomic-Power-Station" target="_blank">Shippingport Atomic Power Station</a>, opened in western Pennsylvania, just about 250 miles west of Three Mile Island. Construction on Three Mile Island&#39;s second nuclear reactor, TMI-2, began more than a year later, on <a href="https://middletownpubliclib.org/three-mile-island-accident/" target="_blank">November 1, 1969</a>.</p><p>TMI-1 went online in 1974; TMI-2 <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/info-finder/decommissioning/power-reactor/three-mile-island-unit-2.html" target="_blank">began operating in 1978</a>. Both units were pressurized water reactors, which rely on feedwater pumps to send pressurized water to a steam generator, which then acts as the reactor&#39;s primary coolant. From the very beginning, the TMI-2 reactor, where the accident would shortly occur, was problematic. It was subject to unscheduled shutdowns due to leaks, and following the accident it was revealed that managers had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/21/us/us-sees-questions-for-3-mile-island.html" target="_blank">deliberately falsified data</a> about the reactor in order to keep the plant operational.</p><h2>2. The disaster unfolded in a matter of seconds. </h2><p>At approximately 4 a.m. on <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html" target="_blank">March 28, 1979</a>, a relatively minor malfunction occurred in the non-nuclear part of the plant when a feedwater pump failed to send water to the steam generator, which prompted both the turbine generator and the TMI-2 reactor itself to automatically shut down as a built-in safety precaution—a process that occurred in about one second.</p><p>To reduce the pressure and heat building within the reactor, a valve was opened to vent steam, then closed once the temperature within the reactor returned to a safe level. Except the valve never did close, despite the instrumentation in the control room reporting otherwise. As a result, <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html" target="_blank">according to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a> (USNRC), &#34;the plant staff was unaware that cooling water in the form of steam was pouring out of the stuck-open valve. As alarms rang and warning lights flashed, the operators did not realize that the plant was experiencing a loss-of-coolant accident.&#34;</p><p>More water was pumped into the reactor, but because of the malfunctioning instrumentation, nobody knew the valve was still open, meaning the water was going right back out. So the reactor continued to heat up and, with no coolant available, the core was exposed, causing major damage.</p><h2>3. Later that day, radiation was vented into the air. </h2>

			</figure>
		<p>Contrary to popular belief, properly functioning nuclear power plants don&#39;t produce a lot of radiation (coal-based power plants actually produce about <a href="https://www.ne.anl.gov/pdfs/NuclearEnergyFAQ.pdf" target="_blank">three times as much</a>). <a href="https://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/radiation/related-info/faq.html#9" target="_blank">According to the USNRC</a>, &#34;most of an operating nuclear power plant&#39;s direct radiation is blocked by the plant&#39;s steel and concrete structures. The remainder dissipates in an area of controlled, uninhabited space around the plant, ensuring that it does not affect any member of the public.&#34;</p><p>Potentially 2 million people were exposed to excess radiation as a result of the Three Mile Island accident. While children and pregnant women were encouraged to evacuate, all told, an estimated 140,000 people left the area of their own volition. An 18-year study of those who lived within 5 miles of the plant—about 150,000 people in total—<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170329050250/https:/www.thebalance.com/three-mile-island-nuclear-accident-facts-impact-today-3306337" target="_blank">found no significant increase in mortality</a> attributable to the Three Mile Island accident, though it did find an increase in the relative risk of certain cancers. </p><h2>4. The Three Mile Island accident occurred less than two months into the term of newly elected Pennsylvania Governor Dick Thornburgh. </h2><p>Thornburgh, a <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67611/25-things-you-should-know-about-pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> native who’d unsuccessfully run for the U.S. House, served as U.S. Attorney for Western Pennsylvania, and gained local renown for prosecuting organized crime figures. He was elected governor in 1978, and had been in office for just 72 days when the crisis hit. He and then-President <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/540375/facts-about-jimmy-carter">Jimmy Carter</a> toured the facility, and his steady hand—he notably did not issue a general evacuation, and he himself stayed in central Pennsylvania—led him to be <a href="https://old.post-gazette.com/pg/09087/958975-85.stm" target="_blank">called the hero of the crisis</a>. Following two terms as governor, Thornburgh was appointed U.S. Attorney General by Ronald Reagan in 1988, and continued to serve in this role under George H.W. Bush until 1991. Thornburgh, who had a distinguished career in public service, passed away at age 88 on December 31, 2020.</p><h2>5. <em>The China Syndrome</em>, a movie that eerily foreshadowed the disaster, premiered less than two weeks before the Three Mile Island accident.</h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bIGH1AfIS18?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p><em>The China Syndrome</em>—which took its title taken from the idea (perhaps a little hyperbolic) that a full meltdown would lead the nuclear core to melt through its containment and burrow through the ground all the way to China—starred Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas as a television news crew who are present during a core accident, and features Jack Lemmon as the nuclear plant’s shift supervisor. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/03/18/archives/nuclear-experts-debate-the-china-syndrome-but-does-it-satisfy-the.html" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em> quoted Westinghouse executive John Taylor</a>, who called the film “an overall character assassination of an entire industry.”</p><h2>6. There were no human casualties.</h2><p>No casualties were reported from the incident at Three Mile Island—but it effectively killed any growth in the nuclear power industry. In the 1960s and 1970s, nuclear power was the leading source of non-carbon-emitting energy, and building nuclear power plants was a major source of revenue and innovation for Westinghouse. But after Three Mile Island, power plants under construction <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/2/29/11132930/nuclear-power-costs-us-france-korea" target="_blank">faced new roadblocks</a>, and orders for new ones dried up. Plans stopped for 39 plants that were being developed. The world belonged to coal and gas—and all their attendant emissions.</p><h2>7. The disaster had a major effect on Bruce Springsteen.</h2><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ypEmmZJXg10?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p>Among the artists inspired to action by the incident was <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/22830/60-springsteen-facts-bruces-60th-birthday">Bruce Springsteen</a>, who lived less than 100 miles from Three Mile Island. He wrote a song called “Roulette” <a href="https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bruce-springsteen/roulette" target="_blank">about the incident</a> and the ongoing debate at the time about whether the benefits of nuclear energy outweighed the potential environmental and health risks. The song, which says that &#34;I&#39;ve got a house full of things that I can&#39;t touch,&#34; <a href="https://genius.com/Bruce-springsteen-roulette-lyrics" target="_blank">opens with the lyrics</a>:</p><p><em>&#34;We left the toys out in the yard </em><br/><em>I took my wife and kids and I left my home unguarded </em><br/><em>We packed what we could into the car </em><br/><em>No one here knows how it started ...&#34;</em></p><p>Though Springsteen originally <a href="https://www.songfacts.com/facts/bruce-springsteen/roulette" target="_blank">recorded the song in 1979</a>, it remained generally unreleased (although available “<a href="https://ur.u1lib.org/book/2203628/59a413" target="_blank">through the miracle of bootlegging</a>,” as the Boss himself once said) until his <em>Tracks</em> box set in 1998. He also joined <a href="https://www.musiciansunited4safeenergy.com/" target="_blank">Musicians United for Safe Energy</a> (MUSE), and performed at their famed “No Nukes” concert. His version of the Detroit Medley was released on the No Nukes album, but Springsteen <a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/bruce-springsteen-to-release-legendary-1979-no-nukes-concert-film-and-album-1235071936/" target="_blank">released his full concert set in 2021</a>.</p><h2>8.

        <![CDATA[<p>Throughout history, sea travel in the name of exploration, trade, and research has provided a watery road to modern globalism. We have always wondered at the waves, finding ways to wade deeper and wander further: The world’s oldest known boat, the <a href="https://drentsmuseum.nl/en/in-the-spotlight-top-exhibits/pesse-canoe" target="_blank">Pesse canoe</a>, dates to around 8000 BCE; there is evidence <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/ship/History-of-ships" target="_blank">Egyptians began sailing around 4000 BCE</a>; and the Phoenicians are credited with ship-building expertise that allowed them to <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/897/the-phoenicians---master-mariners/" target="_blank">circumnavigate Africa</a> in 600 BCE. Here are 11 incredible sea voyages and voyagers that helped advance our understanding of the world.</p><h2>1. Leif Erikson’s Voyage to North America // c. 1000</h2><p>Born in 970, Norse explorer <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/532073/facts-about-leif-erikson">Leif Erikson</a> was the second son of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leif-Erikson" target="_blank">Erik the Red</a><u>,</u> a native of Iceland who colonized Greenland around 980. According to Viking sagas written a few centuries after the events, Erikson heard about an unfamiliar land to the west of Greenland and went to investigate it, eventually landing with a small crew on the northern peninsula of Newfoundland. Though the settlement didn&#39;t last long, archaeological evidence and the sagas suggest that Erikson’s <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/vikings">Vikings</a> were the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/exploration/leif-eriksson" target="_blank">first Europeans to set foot in North America</a>.</p><h2>2. Zheng He’s Seven Diplomatic Voyages // 1405-1433</h2><p>Beginning life as Ma Sanbao in 1371, Zheng He grew up in a prosperous Muslim family in China. When he was about 10, he was captured during Emperor Hong Wu’s attack on his city and made to serve as a court eunuch. He eventually rose up the ranks, becoming a valued diplomat and commander of the Ming Dynasty’s navy. He embarked on <a href="https://exploration.marinersmuseum.org/subject/zheng-he/" target="_blank">his first voyage in 1405</a>, commanding the emperor’s enormous fleet of “treasure ships.” Some of the hundreds of vessels were 400 feet in length, and the whole armada was crewed by 28,000 sailors. During his seven expeditions to lands surrounding the South China Sea and Indian Ocean, Zheng He <a href="https://www.britannica.com/summary/Zheng-Hes-Achievements" target="_blank">helped spread China’s culture</a> and political influence. Chinese emigration increased, as did <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Zheng-He" target="_blank">tributes to Chinese leaders</a>. Upon Zheng He’s death in 1433, and the establishment of a new emperor, the expeditions’ ships and logs were destroyed. This ended the “golden era” of Chinese sea exploration, <a href="https://www.cctv.com/english/special/C14181/20050617/101090.shtml" target="_blank">making room for Europeans</a>.</p><h2>3. Ferdinand Magellan’s Circumnavigation of the Globe // 1519-1522</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>Portuguese sailor Ferdinand Magellan’s voyage is credited with being first to circumnavigate the globe. In 1519, approximately <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/ferdinand-magellan" target="_blank">260 men and five ships</a> set sail from Spain, searching for a western route to the Spice Islands (in modern-day Indonesia). Magellan <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/ferdinand-magellan" target="_blank">named the Pacific Ocean</a> (<em>Pacific</em> means “peaceful”) and discovered the Strait of Magellan at the bottom of South America by accident (it&#39;s <a href="https://www.marineinsight.com/know-more/5-strait-of-magellan-facts-you-must-know/" target="_blank">still used to this day</a> for navigation between the Atlantic and Pacific). While Magellan deserves his due for masterminding the voyage, a <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/magellan-first-sail-around-world-think-again" target="_blank">poison arrow ended him in 1521</a> upon his arrival in the Philippines. According to some historians, <a href="https://www.history.com/news/was-magellan-the-first-person-to-circumnavigate-the-globe" target="_blank">Enrique</a>, an enslaved Malay man in Magellan’s crew, completed the circumnavigation first, albeit over more than one voyage, before Magellan’s remaining 18 crewmembers made it back to Spain in 1522.</p><h2>4. “Pirate Queen” Grace O’Malley’s Defense of Ireland // c. 1546-1586
</h2><p>Irish seafarer Gráinne Ní Mháille, a.k.a. Grace O’Malley, a.k.a. Ireland’s pirate queen, is considered one of the last Irish clan rulers to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/on-the-trail-of-ireland-legendary-pirate-queen" target="_blank">fight against English domination</a> in Ireland. Born in 1530, Grace began her high-stakes, high seas career at age 11, when Ireland was ruled by about 40 Gaelic clans (the <a href="https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/grace-o-malley-irish-female-pirate" target="_blank">O’Malley clan motto</a> was “powerful by land and by sea”). When her father died, it was Grace and not her elder brother who became clan leader, managing two galleys, 20 ships, and more than 200 men to plunder coastal strongholds and defend against English encroachment. When Grace negotiated the release of prisoners and seized land with Queen Elizabeth I, she <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/571511/grace-omalley-pirate-queen">demanded an audience as an equal</a>. A respected matriarch in her time, she was omitted from history for centuries. Today, she is celebrated for her leadership at sea.</p><h2>5. The Sea Venture’s Adventure // 1609-1610</h2><p>The <em>Sea Venture</em> has been dubbed “<a href="https://virginiahistory.org/learn/historical-media/shipwreck-saved-jamestown-sea-venture-castaways-and-fate-america" target="_blank">the shipwreck that saved Jamestown</a>” and inspired <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/558313/facts-about-william-shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> while he <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/sea-venture/" target="_blank">wrote <em>The Tempest</em>.</a> The ship, part of a convoy sent from England in 1609, was supposed to resupply the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/a-short-history-of-jamestown.htm" target="_blank">desperate Virginia colony</a>. But when it sailed straight into a hurricane and rammed a reef around then-uninhabited Bermuda, the <em>Sea Venture</em>’s adventure appeared to be over. However, all <a href="https://jyfmuseums.org/exhibitions/collections-and-exhibitions/special-exhibitions/virginia-company-colonies/sea-venture-essay/" target="_blank">150 souls aboard survived</a> by swimming to shore and set about building two new ships to take them the rest of the way. The castaways arrived in Jamestown about 10 months later. Their story of survival not only restored England’s desire to make its American colony a success; it also led to the <a href="https://encyclopediavirginia.org/entries/sea-venture/" target="_blank">second English colony</a> established in the Americas—not in New England, but in Bermuda.</p><h2>6. The Mayflower’s Arrival in North America // 1620</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>The <em>Mayflower</em>, a second-hand merchant ship carrying 102 passengers, left Plymouth, England, for North America in 1620. Forty of the passengers were Protestant separatists (later known as Pilgrims) who sought to establish a colony in America where they could practice their religion freely. They had <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/colonial-america/mayflower" target="_blank">permission to settle</a> anywhere on the coast between the Chesapeake Bay and New York Harbor. But two miserable months after launch, the <em>Mayflower</em> landed in New England, about one degree of latitude north of where it was meant to be. The colonists named the new settlement Plymouth, drafted a <a href="https://themayflowersociety.org/history/the-mayflower-compact/" target="_blank">document</a> to set guidelines for self-governance, and launched a historic experiment in democracy and religious freedom.</p><h2>7. The Three Voyages of James Cook // 1768-1780</h2><p>James Cook vowed to sail “<a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/whatson/makingamark/teaching-resources/objects/james-cook" target="_blank">as far as I think it possible for man to go</a>” and ended up mapping more territory than any other mariner of his era. He joined the British Royal Navy in his twenties, and in 1767 produced a chart of Newfoundland that was so accurate it was <a href="https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-captain-james-cook" target="_blank">still being used in the 20th century</a>. Cook led his first exploratory expedition in 1768, destined for the South Pacific to observe the transit of Venus and to chart New Zealand, Tasmania, and parts of Australia. He came quite close to spotting Antarctica during a second circumnavigation to explore and map <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/explorers-travelers-and-conquerors-biographies/james-cook" target="_blank">several South Pacific</a> islands. In 1776, on his third and last epic voyage, Cook <a href="https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-captain-james-cook" target="_blank">came within 50 miles</a> of the western entrance to the Northwest Passage in the Bering Strait. He was the first European commander to visit Hawaii, where friction increased between his crew and the local people; Cook was killed by Native Hawaiians in 1779 and the expedition concluded without him the following year. Among his countless observations and discoveries, Cook found that fresh fruits seemed to <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/654198/scurvy-facts">prevent scurvy</a>, without knowing just how the remedy worked.</p><h2>8. The Wreck of the Whaler Essex // 1820</h2><p>Another voyage serving up literary inspiration is the <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-true-life-horror-that-inspired-moby-dick-17576/" target="_blank">tale of the <em>Essex</em></a>. An 87-foot whaling ship, the <em>Essex</em> was built of incredibly strong white oak and fitted for a 2.5-year voyage. It left Nantucket in 1819, made its way around Cape Horn, and headed into the South Pacific. On November 20, 1820, an 85-foot sperm whale rammed the ship twice and caused it to sink, serving some small measure of justice on behalf of his species (numbering 300,000 today from an <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/Sperm-Whale" target="_blank">estimated 1.1 million</a> prior to whaling). While the 20 crewmembers initially survived, they drifted in boats across the open ocean for three months and eventually resorted to cannibalism. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Essex-whaling-ship" target="_blank">Only eight made it home</a>.<u></u> <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/503064/10-fascinating-facts-about-herman-melville">Herman Melville</a> based the climactic scene in <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/72100/11-things-you-might-not-know-about-moby-dick"><em>Moby-Dick</em></a> on the <em>Essex</em> tragedy.</p><h2>9. Charles Darwin’s Voyage on the HMS Beagle // 1831-1836</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_crop,w_1024,h_576,x_0,y_0/c_fill,w_912,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/images/voltaxMediaLibrary/mmsport/mentalfloss/01fxr8rk8b3esk3zydaj.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="The Print Collector/Getty Images" alt="Picture of the HMS Beagle lying on the beach for repairs">

			</figure>
		<p><a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/biographies/scientists/610411-charles-darwin-biography-facts-theory-evolution-and-books">Charles Darwin</a> said his education “<a href="https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/voyage-beagle" target="_blank">really began aboard the <em>Beagle</em></a>.” A fresh university graduate at age 22, Darwin paused his planned career as a clergyman and joined the <em>Beagle</em> as its naturalist. Setting sail in 1831, the <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/darwin/a-trip-around-the-world" target="_blank">ship’s mission</a> was to journey around the world, surveying the South American coast and conducting chronometric studies. Time spent in the Galápagos truly informed Darwin’s theories on evolution, providing an opportunity to observe species development in an isolated environment. Darwin also considered coral, recording geological observations about <a href="https://www.nhm.ac.uk/discover/charles-darwin-coral-conundrum.html" target="_blank">islands and coastlines</a>. And the <em>Beagle</em>, commanded by Lieutenant Robert FitzRoy, achieved its goal of accurately charting the coast of South America, including the Strait of Magellan&#39;s dangerous shoals.</p><h2>10. Ernest Shackleton’s Miraculous Endurance // 1914-1916</h2><p>Anglo-Irish mariner <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653242/sir-ernest-shackleton-explorer-facts">Ernest Shackleton</a> first sailed to Antarctica in 1901 on a mission to reach the South Pole, which ended with a bad case of scurvy. He would come within 97 nautical miles of the pole on his second expedition. But it was his third venture aboard the <em>Endurance</em> for which he is most famous. In 1914, he led a crew of 28 men intending to be the first to <a href="https://www.history.com/news/shackleton-endurance-survival" target="_blank">cross Antarctica</a> by land, but the ship became trapped in pack ice for 10 months and sank on November 21, 1915. The crew set up camp on ice floes, drifted on treacherous seas, and washed up on an uninhabited polar island. Shackleton and five men then sailed 800 miles across the planet’s most rambunctious seas for rescue. All hands succeeded in their revised mission: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernest-Henry-Shackleton" target="_blank">survival</a>. Shackleton’s story serves as a <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/news/articles/Pages/shackleton-anniversary.aspx" target="_blank">lesson in leadership</a> against all odds and overcoming outrageous obstacles.</p><h2>11. Thor Heyerdahl’s Maritime Experiment in the Kon-Tiki and More // 1947-1978</h2><p>Thor Heyerdahl, a Norwegian ethnologist, mounted several <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thor-Heyerdahl" target="_blank">transoceanic scientific expeditions</a>. His expeditions on the <em>Kon-Tiki,</em> a balsa-wood raft launched in 1947, and <em>Ra</em>, a copy of an Egyptian reed boat crewed in 1969, proved the possibility of ancient contact between distant civilizations. Leaving from Peru, <em>Kon-Tiki</em> reached the South Pacific three and a half months later, lending evidence to the theory that pre-Columbian sailors could have navigated across the Pacific. <em>Ra</em> sailed from Morocco to within 600 miles of Central America and hinted at the possibility that Egyptian mariners could have influenced pre-contact cultures. And in 1977-1978, sailing a reed boat named the <em>Tigris</em>, Heyerdahl <a href="https://www.kon-tiki.no/expeditions/kon-tiki-expedition/" target="_blank">suggested</a> that ancient Sumerians could well have reached southwest Asia. His thought-provoking theories are still being debated.</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/famous-sea-voyages-history?utm_source=RSS">11 of History’s Most Famous Sea Voyages</a>. </p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>In 1923, three years after women secured <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67422/19-facts-about-19th-amendment">the right to vote</a> in the U.S., suffragists Alice Paul and Crystal Eastman submitted a proposal for another amendment to the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/553604/facts-about-us-constitution">Constitution</a>, this one guaranteeing equal rights for women across the board. For nearly 50 years, lawmakers repeatedly <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/equal-rights-amendment-explained" target="_blank">introduced the proposal</a> to Congress, where it fizzled every time.</p><p>In March 1972, spurred by a re-energized feminist movement, both chambers finally passed the amendment. Congress then sent it to the states for ratification by a three-fourths majority, along with a seven-year deadline to do so. The <a href="https://www.equalrightsamendment.org/" target="_blank">Twenty-Eighth Amendment</a>, also known as the Equal Rights Amendment, guarantees that “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” </p><p>Another 50 years passed, and the bill has not been ratified. Although Virginia became the 38th state to ratify the bill in early 2020, giving it the three-quarters vote it needed, the amendment has since gotten hung up in debate over the deadline.</p><p>The proposed Equal Rights Amendment has had a long and fascinating history. Here are nine facts you should know.</p><h2>1. Supporters say the Equal Rights Amendment would firm up protections for women.</h2><p>Advocates <a href="https://time.com/5657997/equal-rights-amendment-history/" target="_blank">say the amendment could help</a> women in the workplace with securing maternity leave, in averting pregnancy discrimination and in combating violence against women. They say the constitution needs an explicit prohibition against sex discrimination for gender equality to truly exist. Without a constitutional amendment, rights would be left to the whims of the party and people in power and could fluctuate.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/equal-rights-amendment-need-know/" target="_blank">ERA supporters point out</a> that even though the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law, many conservatives argue that sex is not included. Ditto for Title IX and the Civil Rights Act, which are pieces of legislation that can be changed.</p><h2>2. Five states tried to rescind their vote to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment.</h2><p>Kentucky, Nebraska, Tennessee, South Dakota, and Idaho all voted to ratify the ERA and then voted to rescind their ratifications—all before the 1982 deadline. It’s unlikely that states can <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/will-congress-ever-ratify-equal-rights-amendment/580849/" target="_blank">rescind ratification</a>, yet no less than late Supreme Court Justice <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/76804/15-things-you-should-know-about-ruth-bader-ginsburg">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> questioned it. Ginsburg, a supporter of the ideals of the ERA, said that if states were allowed to ratify the ERA after the deadline, then &#34;how can you disregard states that say, &#39;We&#39;ve <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/02/13/805647054/house-votes-to-revive-equal-rights-amendment-removing-ratification-deadline" target="_blank">changed our minds</a>’?&#39;&#34;</p><h2>3. The original Equal Rights Amendment proposal was called the “Lucretia Mott Amendment.”</h2><p>Alice Paul, of the National Women’s Party, and pacifist lawyer Crystal Eastman <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/equal-rights-amendment-96-years-old-and-still-not-part-constitution-heres-why-180973548/" target="_blank">drafted the wording</a> of the original proposed amendment, naming it after the 19th-century women’s rights activist. The original amendment stated that “Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.”</p><h2>4. Eleanor Roosevelt initially opposed the Equal Rights Amendment.</h2><p>Because of her close ties with the labor movement, first lady <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/59326/11-facts-eleanor-roosevelts-130th-birthday">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> did not <a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/eleanor-roosevelt-and-women-s-rights.htm" target="_blank">endorse</a> the Equal Rights Amendment. Roosevelt felt, as did many opponents, that the amendment would negate protective legislation for women in the workplace.<br/><br/>As labor unions and collective bargaining agreements gained ground, Roosevelt’s opinion of the ERA began to change. In 1946, she publicly withdrew her opposition to it.<br/><br/>In addition to labor opponents like Roosevelt, the ERA also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/06/18/the-equal-rights-amendment-has-been-dead-for-36-years-why-it-might-be-on-the-verge-of-a-comeback/" target="_blank">faced criticism</a> from Black Americans, who urged white feminists to focus on securing the voting rights of Black women and people of color. Alice Paul and others refused to do so, creating a fissure in the suffrage movement.</p><h2>5. Most of the Southern states have opposed the Equal Rights Amendment all along.</h2><p>Three-fourths of state legislatures must ratify an amendment for it to be added to the constitution, and the ERA gained most of those within the first year. It was three votes shy of ratification by the original deadline and again by the extended deadline.<br/><br/>Illinois, Nevada, and Virginia all signed on in the past five years. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/map-of-states-for-and-against-the-equal-rights-amendment" target="_blank">Another 12 states</a> are holdouts: North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Missouri, Oklahoma, Utah, and Arizona.</p><h2>6. Phyllis Schlafly’s opposition to the Equal Rights Amendment launched the modern conservative movement. </h2><p>The ERA failed to be ratified by the original deadline owes largely due to conservative activist and attorney Phyllis Schlafly, whose arguments against it ultimately laid the groundwork for many of today’s conservative talking points.<br/><br/>Schlafly argued that the amendment would strip women of their real power and force upon them—and society—<a href="https://www.history.com/news/equal-rights-amendment-failure-phyllis-schlafly" target="_blank">a host of moral ills</a>. Chief among those: women in the draft, “abortion on demand,” same-sex marriage, and genderless bathrooms.<br/><br/>Schlafly organized grassroots movements to pressure state legislatures to reject ratification of the amendment and formed Stop ERA, for “Stop Taking Our Power,” in 1972. That group morphed into the religious right organization Eagle Forum, which is still active. Ironically, Schlafly argued adamantly for women to remain at home as dutiful wives and mothers while she worked as an attorney and traveled the country promoting her views.</p><h2>7. The last constitutional amendment took 203 years to ratify. </h2><p>The Twenty-Seventh Amendment, which prohibits Congress from changing its salary before an election, was ratified in May 1992—203 years after it was introduced. The amendment was the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Twenty-seventh-Amendment" target="_blank">second of 12 amendments</a> proposed by the first Congress in 1789, 10 of which were ratified and became the Bill of Rights. <br/><br/>The Twenty-Seventh Amendment didn’t include a deadline for ratification, and interest in it waxed and waned. After a resurgence of interest in the 1980s, the ratification effort picked up again and the remaining number of states necessary signed on. The archivist of the United States certified the amendment on May 18, 1992.</p><h2>8. More than 11,000 constitutional amendments have been proposed.</h2><p>The first 10 amendments to the Constitution formed the Bill of Rights and were ratified in 1791. Since then, <a href="https://www.archivesfoundation.org/amendments-u-s-constitution" target="_blank">more than 11,000 amendments</a> have been proposed, with just 27 making it through the entire process.<br/><br/>Congress has sent a total of 33 constitutional amendments to the states for ratification, meaning <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/24412/6-constitutional-amendments-just-missed-cut">six are left outstanding</a>. Three were introduced in the 20th century: the ERA, the Child Labor Amendment (rendered moot by the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938), and an amendment giving D.C. full voting rights. The others are relics, dealing with titles of nobility, representation in Congress, and slavery.</p><h2>9. The Equal Rights Amendment’s deadline is still being debated.</h2><p>Congress imposed a deadline of 1979 for ratification by three-quarters of the states, then extended that to 1982. Because the deadline came and went, some believe the amendment is dead. Others argue that because the deadline was in the preamble and not the actual text of the amendment, it can still be adopted.<br/><br/>The archivist of the United States is tasked with certifying newly ratified amendments to the Constitution. But when the current archivist asked the Trump administration’s Department of Justice for <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/02/equal-rights-amendment-constitution/621629/" target="_blank">an opinion</a> on the ERA’s validity, it issued a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opinions/attachments/2020/01/16/2020-01-06-ratif-era.pdf" target="_blank">38-page document</a> saying the amendment is invalid because ratification came after Congress&#39;s deadline. Thus, the National Archives has not published and certified the amendment.<br/><br/>Democrats have introduced legislation to remove the deadline or affirm that the amendment has met the necessary requirements. The final three states to ratify the amendment—Illinois, Nevada, and Virginia—sued to force the National Archives to formally certify it. In February 2022, Virginia’s newly elected Republican Attorney General <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/02/18/virginia-era-appeal-withdrawl/" target="_blank">withdrew</a> from the lawsuit.

        <![CDATA[<p>On the afternoon of July 6, 1907, an office messenger at <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie/history/" target="_blank">Dublin Castle</a> made an unsettling discovery in one of the site’s towers. He had been instructed to deposit a knight’s gold collar inside a safe containing the Irish Crown Jewels, a collection of dazzling insignia. But when the messenger, William Stivey, went to open the door of the safe, he found it was already unlocked.</p><p>Stivey rushed to inform Sir Arthur Vicars, who presided over the Office of Arms, a small bureau that, among other duties, was responsible for the maintenance of the jewels. Vicars possessed the only two keys to the safe. One, which he had temporarily given to Stivey, was <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/irish-crown-jewels-theft" target="_blank">normally kept in his pocket</a> or on a chain around his neck. The other was hidden at his house in Dublin. Vicars told Stivey that he was certain he had locked the safe after last opening it. He raced to the office’s library, where the safe was located, and peered inside. The Crown Jewels—along with <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=02oMAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA10-PA20&amp;lpg=RA10-PA20&amp;dq=arthur+vicars+mother%27s+diamonds&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zx-s1jnuJG&amp;sig=ACfU3U2y7QKYu1ehUc4HGwuLG9ylBA5N5A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiS7-S2kKj2AhXjGjQIHdQ3D6MQ6AF6BAgkEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=arthur%20vicars%20mother&#39;s%20diamonds&amp;f=true" target="_blank">his own mother’s diamonds</a>, which he had stashed in the safe—were gone.</p><p>The stolen jewels have never been found, and their disappearance remains one of <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/30263/fantastic-120-year-old-color-pictures-ireland">Ireland</a>’s most tantalizing mysteries. In the months following the <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/section/crime">theft</a>, astonishing revelations emerged about security breaches at Dublin Castle and shifty characters with links to the Office of Arms. The British king was accused of covering up details of the crime. The brother of a famous explorer was named as a suspect. And at the heart of the scandal were salacious allegations—first whispered, then shouted—about a secret, gay party scene within the castle walls.</p><p>“There is more to play for here than just the theft of the jewels,” <a href="https://mylesdungan.com/" target="_blank">Myles Dungan</a>, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealing-Irish-Crown-Jewels-Unsolved/dp/1860591825" target="_blank"><em>The Stealing of the Irish Crown Jewels: An Unsolved Crime</em></a>, tells Mental Floss. “There are reputations at risk.”</p><h2>A Reward for Loyalty to the Crown</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>A grand complex in the center of the city, Dublin Castle was, for some 700 years, the seat of English and British rule in Ireland. The turn of the 20th century was a relatively “quiescent” period in Irish history, according to Dungan, but the push for an independent domestic government was <a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/irish-crown-jewels-theft" target="_blank">underway</a>, setting nationalists in opposition to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ulster-Unionist-Party" target="_blank">unionists</a> loyal to the Crown. It was against this simmering political climate that the jewels—an enduring symbol of colonial rule in Ireland—disappeared from the castle. </p><p>Unlike their English counterparts, the Irish Crown Jewels were not used in coronations, but were instead the insignia of the Order of St. Patrick, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410113242/http:/homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/irhismys/jewels.htm" target="_blank">founded in 1783</a> to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090227015333/http:/www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Honours/OrderofStPatrick.aspx" target="_blank">reward Irish nobles and office-holders</a> with prestigious knighthoods. The jewels comprised several knights’ collars and a star and badge adorned with Brazilian diamonds, shamrocks made of emeralds, and ruby crosses. In 1907, the jewels were <a href="https://irishmediahistory.com/2016/12/13/the-curious-case-of-sherlock-holmes-and-the-irish-crown-jewels-or-not/" target="_blank">valued</a> at more than £30,000; today, according to <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie/the-theft-of-the-irish-crown-jewels/" target="_blank">Dublin Castle</a>, they would be worth “several million euro.”</p><p>Vicars, who held the centuries-old title “Ulster King of Arms,” was primarily responsible for tracing aristocratic genealogies and overseeing heraldry in Ireland. A pedantic fellow, he relished this niche work, but was less enthused about caring for the Crown Jewels—another important part of his job. He was at times bewilderingly cavalier about the insignia&#39;s security, an attitude that would come to haunt him until the end of his life. </p><h2>An Inside Job?</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>The trouble arguably started when the Office of Arms moved to new accommodations in Dublin Castle’s Bedford Tower. A strong room was built to house the Crown Jewels, but in a farcical turn of events, workers found that the safe holding the insignia didn’t fit through the door. In consultation with the castle’s Board of Works, Vicars decided to put the safe in the library, a high-traffic space that also functioned as the Office of Arms&#39;s waiting room. He never got around to acquiring a smaller safe, even after revising the Order’s statutes to stipulate that the jewels should be relocated to the strong room. </p><p>The insignia were last seen on June 11, 1907, when Vicars took them out of the safe to show them to a visitor. Then came a series of alarming incidents that pointed to nefarious goings-on at the Office of Arms. </p><p>On June 28, Vicars’s key to the front door of the tower went missing; it would <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.ie/topics/crown_jewels/" target="_blank">reappear</a> two days after the theft was discovered. On the morning of July 3, the office cleaner, Mrs. Farrell, arrived at work to find the door already unlocked. “Did she?” Vicars reportedly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410113242/http:/homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/irhismys/jewels.htm" target="_blank">responded</a> upon being informed of this concerning development. He similarly failed to act when, three days later, Mrs. Farrell noticed that the strong room’s outer door had been left ajar. </p><p>When the disappearance of the jewels came to light later that afternoon, Vicars finally summoned the Dublin Metropolitan Police. Investigators concluded that the locks to the front door, strong room, and safe had <em>not</em> been forced, indicating that the thief had the original keys or well-made copies. Chief Inspector John Kane of Scotland Yard was called in to help solve the crime, which he believed was an inside job.</p><h2>The Other Shackleton</h2>

			</figure>
		<p>Suspicion soon <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie/the-theft-of-the-irish-crown-jewels/" target="_blank">fell on Francis Shackleton</a>, the younger brother of famed Antarctic explorer <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/653242/sir-ernest-shackleton-explorer-facts">Ernest Shackleton</a>. The Shackletons were a middle-class Irish family living in England, where charming Francis rose in aristocratic circles, enjoying friendships with the likes of the 9th Duke of Argyll, brother-in-law of King Edward VII. In 1905, Vicars offered Shackleton the position of “Dublin Herald” in the Office of Arms; it was an unpaid, largely honorary title. </p><p>“He&#39;s on a path where, if he&#39;s a good boy—which he wasn&#39;t—he will probably get a knighthood or something,” Dungan says.</p><p>Shackleton had been trying to make his fortune through land speculation in Mexico, but police discovered that his finances were strained—a plausible motive for stealing the jewels. He also lived with Vicars during his visits to Dublin, which would have made it relatively easy for him to slip away with one of Vicars’s safe keys and procure a copy. </p><p>But building a case against Shackleton proved problematic. For one, he had an alibi; he had left Dublin for England on June 11 and returned after the theft was discovered.<strong> </strong>That didn’t rule out the possibility that Shackleton had orchestrated the crime with the help of an accomplice, but investigators may have been <a href="https://www.dublincastle.ie/the-theft-of-the-irish-crown-jewels/" target="_blank">reluctant</a> to press Shackleton on this theory. At a time when sex acts between men <a href="https://www.bl.uk/lgbtq-histories/articles/a-short-history-of-lgbt-rights-in-the-uk" target="_blank">were illegal in Britain</a>, Shackleton’s homosexuality was an <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/655299/antinous-gay-code-word-victorian-era">open secret</a>; police may have feared he’d reveal scandalous information about prominent aristocrats in his orbit—like his friend the Duke of Argyll, who was also <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/vaccine-hope-gaza-s-medical-system-citizen-cicada-scientists-shrek-at-20-libraries-adapt-to-covid-and-more-1.6035248/princess-louise-queen-victoria-s-daughter-was-known-for-causing-scandal-and-strong-ties-to-canada-author-1.6035257" target="_blank">rumored to be gay</a>, or the duke’s closest friend, the sculptor<a href="https://thehistoryofparliament.wordpress.com/2021/02/24/new-podcast-for-lgbt-history-month-lord-ronald-gower-1845-1916/" target="_blank">Lord Ronald Gower</a>.</p><p>“His life in London was totally documented by Scotland Yard,” Brian Lacey, author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Terrible-Queer-Creatures-Homosexuality-History/dp/1905569963" target="_blank"><em>Terrible Queer Creatures</em></a><em>: Homosexuality in Irish History</em>, tells Mental Floss. If Shackleton had nothing left to lose, he might spill the tea to save himself from prosecution.</p><p>There were other sensitive matters to consider. In his book, Dungan writes that police discovered Vicars was in the habit of hosting “soirées” at the castle, with “some of Dublin’s leading homosexuals” among his guests. The son of the Lord Lieutenant, who represented the king in Ireland, reportedly attended these parties—another aristocrat with potentially damaging connections to the heist. The king’s secretary was made aware of “scandalous conduct” at the castle, according to Dungan, and some have theorized that Edward VII <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/ireland-s-crown-jewels-the-case-of-the-king-the-courtiers-and-the-gay-coverup-77951.html" target="_blank">stepped in</a> to prevent any scurrilous revelations from becoming public. </p><p>A report written by Inspector Kane upon the conclusion of his investigation subsequently vanished—perhaps because it contained mention of “other stuff going on in the Office of Arms,” Dungan says. But someone had to pay for the theft of the jewels, which had caused considerable embarrassment to the administration. Vicars was asked to resign, but he refused, demanding a public inquiry. The Lord Lieutenant instead assembled a viceregal commission in January 1908, which<strong> </strong>sat in private, had no authority to compel witnesses to give evidence, and was primarily concerned with determining whether Vicars “exercised due vigilance … as the custodian” of the jewels.<strong> </strong>Not without justification, Vicars was found negligent and fired from his post. But the proceedings were essentially a “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410113242/http:/homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/irhismys/jewels.htm">whitewash</a>,” more concerned with scapegoating Vicars than uncovering the facts of the crime, writes historian Sean J. Murphy. </p><h2>“Abominations” Exposed</h2>

		<p>Officials may have hoped that heaping blame on Vicars would put the debacle at Dublin Castle to rest, and they were successful in keeping any <u></u><a href="https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/irish-crown-jewels-theft" target="_blank">whiff of a gay scandal</a> out of the Irish press. But across the pond, shocking allegations were percolating. On July 4, 1908, a damning headline blared across the front page of <em>The Gaelic American</em>, an Irish American newspaper: “ABOMINATIONS OF DUBLIN CASTLE EXPOSED.” </p><p>The <a href="https://digital.library.villanova.edu/Item/vudl:687422#?c=&amp;m=&amp;s=&amp;cv=&amp;xywh=41%2C1149%2C1731%2C930" target="_blank">article</a> proceeded to name Shackleton as “either the thief or a party to the theft of the jewels.” Since his appointment to the Office of Arms, the piece contended, “rumors began to circulate in Dublin that there were nightly orgies at the Castle, in which several prominent Government officials were mixed up.” Those “whispered stories,” the article asserted, were true, but had been “hushed up” under the direction of Edward VII.</p><p>The piece was published anonymously, but it is known to have been written by <a href="https://www.dib.ie/biography/hobson-john-bulmer-a4038" target="_blank">Bulmer Hobson</a>, a journalist and influential member of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/profiles/po17.shtml" target="_blank">Irish Republican Brotherhood</a>, which sought to establish an independent republican government. Hobson does not name his sources, but later revealed that the information came from <a href="https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-93746" target="_blank">Pierce O’Mahony</a>, a nationalist politician and Vicars’s half-brother. Hobson’s objectives in publishing the exposé were undoubtedly political. </p><p>“What he really was trying to show was that the British were evil and wicked,” Lacey says. </p><p>Lacey thus suspects that the “nightly orgies” Hobson describes with a sensational flourish were more likely “relatively nice drinks parties, in which [guests] may have camped it up a bit.” But Dungan is more inclined to accept Hobson’s allegations. </p><p>“I don&#39;t think they&#39;re outlandish at all,” he says, “because it wouldn&#39;t have been the first time.”</p><h2>A History of Scandal</h2>

		<p>In fact, the theft of the Crown Jewels marked the <em>third</em> gay controversy in two decades that embroiled high-ranking members of the British establishment. In the early 1880s, allegations made by an Irish nationalist journal led to the exposure of a “<a href="https://www.nationalarchives.ie/article/behind-the-scenes-weve-seen-the-pillars-tumble-the-fall-of-james-pillar/" target="_blank">network of gay men</a> who were active in the city’s gay underground,” writes historian Brian Crowley—among them the director of detectives with the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Secretary of the General Post Office of Ireland. The <a href="https://digpodcast.org/2018/07/22/dublin-castle-scandal/" target="_blank">Dublin Castle Scandal</a>—so called because it implicated Crown employees in Ireland—was followed by another salacious event in London. Known as the <a href="https://rictornorton.co.uk/eighteen/1889clev.htm" target="_blank">Cleveland Street Scandal</a>, the affair began in 1889, when police discovered that a cohort of “telegraph boys” from the post office were working at a male brothel catering to aristocratic men.</p><p>These incidents were the source of great “<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/44871105?seq=7#metadata_info_tab_contents" target="_blank">public anxiety</a>” and may explain why officials were eager to conceal even remote aristocratic connections to the theft of the Crown Jewels, according to Lacey. “Any investigation that would reveal God-knows-what ... would open up a can of worms which leads right up to the monarchy itself,” he says. “That couldn&#39;t be allowed.”</p><p>Because no one was ever arrested for stealing the jewels, theories about the heist have simmered over the past 115 years. Was it a nationalist plot, hatched to embarrass the Crown? Or perhaps unionists stole the insignia to <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=53hUVF5XxYAC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;lpg=PA134&amp;dq=crown+jewels+unionist+plot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1UigoK3utC&amp;sig=ACfU3U1i2Nzrm2n0_aRZta-xcz26uRVWXQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjMmseUyqX2AhWdjokEHX3nCRMQ6AF6BAgyEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=crown%20jewels%20unionist%20plot&amp;f=true" target="_blank">disrupt the push</a> for an autonomous Irish government? Suspicion has also been cast on Francis Bennett Goldney, a former mayor of Canterbury who, like Shackleton, held an honorary position at the Office of Arms. Goldney, it turns out, <em>was</em> a thief; after his death, it emerged that he had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210410113242/http:/homepage.eircom.net/~seanjmurphy/irhismys/jewels.htm" target="_blank">stolen ancient charters</a> belonging to the City of Canterbury and a painting belonging to a duke.</p><p>But many believe that cash-strapped Francis Shackleton remains the most plausible culprit, and likely enlisted an accomplice to break into the safe. That accomplice may have been Captain Richard Gorges, a military man with a notorious reputation; he was known to be gay and was reportedly <a href="https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1912/dec/20/crown-jewels-dublin" target="_blank">prone to violence</a>, eventually going to prison for killing a police officer. Gorges was acquainted with Shackleton, whose own propensity for criminal behavior became clear in the years after the jewels went missing. In 1913, having declared bankruptcy, he was <a href="https://www.dib.ie/biography/shackleton-francis-richard-frank-a7988" target="_blank">convicted of financial fraud</a> and sentenced to 15 months&#39; hard labor.</p><p>Vicars—woefully careless, but ruled out as a suspect by police—also met a sorry end. After being fired from the Office of Arms, he tried to establish his own genealogical practice in London, but was not successful and moved back to Ireland. In 1921, a mob claiming to be affiliated with the IRA <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/15/opinion/IHT-1921ira-murder-in-our-pages100-75-and-50-years-ago.html" target="_blank">shot Vicars to death</a> outside his house. To the end of his days, he remained deeply embittered over his treatment during the Crown Jewels scandal. </p><p>“I might have had more to dispose of had it not been for the outrageous way in which I was treated by the Irish [government] over the loss of the Irish Crown Jewels,” he wrote in his will, claiming Shackleton was the true culprit. “My whole life and work was ruined by this cruel misfortune.”</p><br><p>This article was originally published on mentalfloss.com as <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/posts/irish-crown-jewels-theft-gay-scandal?utm_source=RSS">A Very Irish Scandal: The Gay Rumors Behind the Unsolved Irish Crown Jewels Heist of 1907</a>. </p>]]>
