This holiday, we&#x2019;ll likely talk about Ukrainian families that went from living their lives to running for their lives.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">But as Passover approaches, I&#x2019;m replaying a conversation I had with Dov Linzer, an Orthodox rabbi with whom I used to co-host a <a href="https://www.tabletmag.com/podcasts/parsha-in-progress">podcast</a> about the Torah portion of the week. He told me that the key line about empathizing with the stranger isn&#x2019;t mentioned in his Haggadah at all<i>.</i> He was startled that the chief mandate I had absorbed is to think about who is in trouble now, because Jews once were in trouble ourselves.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="follow-cta"> <section> <h3>Follow The Atlantic</h3> </section> <section> <p><button href="https://apple.news/T3O-2yOUDRxe26-EzssiG_g?subscribe=1" data-role="link_button">follow</button></p> </section> </section><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">That wasn&#x2019;t the ethos of his boyhood seder. The line in his traditional Haggadah on which he focused, he told me, is &#x201C;In every generation our enemies rise up against us to destroy us, but God always delivers us out of their hands&#x201D;&#x2014;a reminder that anti-Semitism is inevitable and only God saves the day.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="custom-recirculation"> <section> <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/texas-synagogue-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theory/621286/">Yair Rosenberg: Why so many people still don&#x2019;t understand anti-Semitism</a></p> </section> </section><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">To be clear, the Haggadah is known to be a fluid document, unlike the Hebrew Bible. There have been countless iterations of the text, though the 15 steps of the seder, which translates to &#x201C;order,&#x201D; have remained fairly fixed. The main obligation of the ritual is to tell the Exodus story to your children.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">But this year, my usual orientation toward &#x201C;the stranger,&#x201D; or, in contemporary parlance, &#x201C;the other,&#x201D; feels oversimplified, insufficient, naive to the idea&#x2014;however hard to accept&#x2014;that the hated &#x201C;other&#x201D; is sometimes us. I&#x2019;m alert to the spike in anti-Semitic ugliness throughout the world. According to the Anti-Defamation League,<a href="https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/antisemitic-incidents-hit-all-time-high-in-2019"> 2019 saw more anti-Semitic incidents</a> than any other year since the organization began tracking such incidents four decades ago. This year and last, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/texas-synagogue-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theory/621286/">anti-Semitic hate crimes</a> were the most commonly <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/stats/reports-analysis/hate-crimes.page">reported</a> type of bias crimes in New York City. Hateful tweets about Jews increased by <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/ministry-report-highlights-backlash-against-world-jewry-over-2021-gaza-conflict/">31 percent</a> in 2021, according to an Israeli-government report.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Americans seem inured to finding <a href="https://www.thehofstraclocktower.com/news/hofstra-swastikas-found-third-year">swastikas in dorm rooms</a>, seeing Hasidic Jews <a href="https://m.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-691825">beaten</a> on sidewalks, and listening to Israel&#x2019;s existence be vilified. Crass Holocaust analogies are deployed from both sides of the political aisle.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">What hit closest to home for me, though, was the harrowing Sabbath in January when my rabbi, Angela Buchdahl of Central Synagogue in New York,<a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/in-captives-of-hope-sermon-rabbi-angela-buchdahl-describes-call-with-texas-gunman/"> fielded deranged calls</a> from a gunman, Malik Faisal Akram. He demanded that she use her &#x201C;influence&#x201D; to free a jailed terrorist while he held four hostages for 11 hours in a Colleyville, Texas, synagogue.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">One of Akram&#x2019;s hostages, Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker, exemplified not only the calm and courage of a true leader but the tension between different themes of the Haggadah: Do we welcome the stranger or treat him with suspicion? When Akram knocked on the locked synagogue&#x2019;s door, Cytron-Walker offered him not distrust but a cup of tea. Cytron-Walker was later deservedly lauded for that kindness, though at the same time synagogues everywhere rushed to increase their security.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">I don&#x2019;t subscribe to the fear, heard in some Jewish circles, that it&#x2019;s 1938 all over again. But I have also never in my lifetime watched Jews painted so starkly as master manipulators, oppressors, colonizers, even Nazis, excluded from progressive efforts for social justice. I never imagined that I&#x2019;d see signs blaring <small data-anf-textstyle="smallCapsStyle"><a href="https://www.adl.org/extremismblog">Zionism is terrorism</a></small>, or flyers left on doorsteps <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/antisemitic-flyers-found-in-san-franciscos-pacific-heights-neighborhood/2786732/">blaming the pandemic</a> on a Jewish plot. I find it mind-boggling that white supremacists have even found a way to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/white-supremacists-condemn-ukraine-conflict-as-a-brother-war-some-blame-jews/">blame the Jewish president of Ukraine</a> for engineering a war to get white Europeans killed.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">The ground has shifted, and Passover must too.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">I&#x2019;m struggling this year to reconcile the lessons I&#x2019;ve taken from the holiday: to help the world, but also to remember how often the world has turned on us. Maybe the seder needs to be a call not only for empathy but also for vigilance. And yet if I reorient my prayers, will the directive I&#x2019;ve always most valued&#x2014;to care and to act&#x2014;be applied chiefly to my family, so that we <i>forget</i> the stranger?</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="custom-recirculation"> <section> <p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/anti-semitism-new-normal-america/608017/">Gary Rosenblatt: Is it still safe to be a Jew in America?</a></p> </section> </section><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">I remain committed to my Haggadah&#x2019;s charge&#x2014;not just to recount our own oppression, but to resolve not to oppress others. I will hold my fellow Jews to that standard without equivocation. But I&#x2019;m wrestling now with Passover&#x2019;s other clarion call: to remember that we had enemies once, and that we have them still.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">At the end of the seder, we open the door for the prophet Elijah&#x2014;the harbinger of the Messiah&#x2014;yearning for a better world.</p><p class="ArticleParagraph_root__wy3UI">Two clashing explanations for the Elijah ritual reverberate this year&#x2014;one modern, one medieval. The first is that we open the door to symbolize that humans have a role to play in redemption. The other is that, in a time of hatred, Jews must remain on guard, opening the door to make sure the enemy is not waiting on the other side.</p><div class="ArticleBody_partialDivider__mhy5a" id="article-end" style="height:1px"></div><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="custom-author-bio"> <section> <h2><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/abigail-pogrebin/" class="author-link" data-label="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/abigail-pogrebin/" data-action="click author - name" >Abigail Pogrebin</a> is the author of <em><a href="https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9781941493205">My Jewish Year: 18 Holidays, One Wondering Jew</a>,</em> and a former president of Central Synagogue in New York.</h2> <h3></h3> </section> </section> ]]>
