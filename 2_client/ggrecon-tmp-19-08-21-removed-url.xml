        <![CDATA[<p>Check your tickets - the <a href="/articles/vanguard-nazi-imagery/"><em>Vanguard </em></a>hype train is about to roll into the station. The World War II-themed <a href="/call-of-duty/"><em>Call of Duty </em></a>adventure is gearing up for its announcement on August 19, and in the meantime, speculation and rumours are rife as to the shape that the game and its story will take. But one subsect of <em>Call of Duty </em>fans is worried about a specific mode’s future.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p><em>Zombies</em> has been a critical part of the series’ development, with a hugely dedicated fanbase rallying for the undead-slaying mode in particular. Some developers other than Treyarch have made attempts at the formula. With <em>Advanced Warfare</em>’s exo-zombies and <em>WWII</em>’s horror-centric take on zombies, new gameplay was established - but they never really replicated the magic of Treyarch’s timeless mode.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, it looks like we won’t have to miss out when <em>Vanguard </em>comes around.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Is Treyarch Working On Vanguard Zombies?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/mnjcckc0/mauer-zombies.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Treyarch Is Making Vanguard's Zombies Mode" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="Treyarch"></p>
<p>Rest easy, Zombies fans, because it looks like Treyarch isn’t finished with <em>Zombies</em> just yet. It was announced that a whole slew of legacy developers from the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise had been working on <em>Vanguard </em>and have been making their own additions to the game.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>This long list includes the likes of Activision, High Noon Studios, Beenox, Raven and Sledgehammer Games - but most importantly, Treyarch is on board with its own additions.</p>

</div>
<p>According to leaker Tom Henderson, Treyarch’s tinkerings on the game are much more focussed than that of the others - and has suggested that its sole responsibility for <em>Vanguard </em>is its <em>Zombies</em> mode.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>But, excitingly, it doesn’t end there.</p>
<h2>Is Zombies Chronicles 2 Coming To Vanguard?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/bdebo3ze/zombie.jpg?width=300&amp;height=168" alt="Treyarch Is Making Vanguard's Zombies Mode" width="300" height="168" data-caption="Treyarch"></p>
<p>It was also suggested by Henderson that <em><a rel="noopener" href="/articles/call-of-duty-zombies-chronicles-development/" target="_blank" title="Call Of Duty: Zombies Chronicles 2 Is ‘In Development’">Zombie Chronicles 2</a> - </em>the sequel to the anthology DLC pack for classic Zombies maps - could be coming straight to <em>Vanguard</em>. The leaker suggested in an article on <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/zombies-chronicles-2-is-in-development-but-it-might-not-release-this-year/">DualShockers</a> that if the pack will come at any time after its long development, it’ll coincide with <em>Vanguard</em>’s life cycle. This means it's especially likely that it’ll come to the WWII title.</p>
<p>Plus, with Treyarch now confirmed to be on the development team of <em>Vanguard</em>, if we can expect <em>Chronicles 2</em> any time soon, it’s almost guaranteed to make its debut in the newest <em>Call of Duty</em>. <em>Zombies</em> fans, you are now permitted to squeal with delight.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>For many people, <em>Vanguard</em>’s draw could well be its additions to the <em>Zombies</em> mythos. If we’re lucky, it’ll be exactly the mode we know, love, and fondly remember.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The <em><a href="/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty">Call of Duty</a> Vanguard </em>rumour mill has been heating up this week as we've learned it reportedly <a href="/ggrecon.com/articles/vanguard-nazi-imagery/">will contain Nazi imagery</a>, <a href="/articles/treyarch-working-on-zombies-mode-for-vanguard/">Treyarch is working on the Zombies mode</a>, and we even saw the first <a href="/articles/brand-new-call-of-duty-vanguard-teaser-trailer-drops/"><em>Vanguard </em></a><a href="/articles/brand-new-call-of-duty-vanguard-teaser-trailer-drops/">teaser trailer</a>. The latest news coming out of Verdansk however, is that the in-game <em>Warzone </em>event will feature PvE gameplay, as opposed to the usual PvP action.</p>

<p>For those of you who don't know, PvE stands for Player vs Environment. This essentially means that you won't be fighting other players, because that would be PvP: Player vs Player. "Environment" is a vague term in this case though, because it could mean anything from incoming WWII soldiers who have been transported to the future in Verdansk, to the previous zombies event, or something else entirely.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Those zombies we saw when Verdansk was taken back in time was the first PvE event in <em>Warzone</em>, which means this isn't completely out of the ordinary for the hit battle royale. Since this is a reveal event for the next title in the prestigious franchise though, expect things to pop <em>off</em>. This will undoubtedly be on a scale like we've never seen before.</p>
<p>Going by the fictional propaganda posters tweeted out by the official <em>Call of Duty </em>account, we'd recommend you get some pals online to take on the event with. Each one mentions something about your team or squadding up, so taking it on solo seems like a poor idea.</p>
<p>You can find the <em>Warzone </em>reveal event for <em>Call of Duty Vanguard </em>in-game via the Care Package event, which kicks off at 10:30am PT/1:30pm ET/6:30pm BST tomorrow, August 19. If you needed any more motivation for jumping into the event, you can also <a href="/articles/heres-what-you-can-win-in-warzones-vanguard-event/">win some sweet rewards</a>. Who knows what the PvE element will be, but as long as it's not zombies again, everybody wins.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>After eight months and five stages of regular-season competition, the <em><a href="/call-of-duty/" title="Call of Duty">Call of Duty</a> League</em>’s (<a href="/cdl/" title="CDL">CDL</a>) second season is coming to an end. Eight of the 12 teams have secured their place in a double-elimination bracket and a chance to win the lion’s share of $2.5 million in prize money.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Over the course of the <em>Black Ops Cold War season</em>, there have been a number of teams that have achieved victory at Majors as well as springing some shock surprises against the more established front-runners, ensuring that the 2021 Championship Weekend will be the most competitive tournament of the entire season.</p>
<p>With every single team competing at the Galen Center capable of defeating each other, there are several contenders that could be walking away with the trophy on Sunday evening, much to the excitement of fans in attendance and the viewers watching from home. With that said, we take a look at which teams we think will be in the running at the final <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> tournament of the season.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Minnesota RØKKR</h2>
<p><img src="/media/wlgotljd/minnesota-rokkr-stage-5-major-winners.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>A few weeks ago, many wouldn’t have even considered Røkkr as a championship contender but after completing the <a href="/articles/attach-standy-minnesota-rokkr-fans/" title="Attach And Standy Praise The Minnesota Fans At The 'RØKKR Resurrection'">greatest comeback ever seen</a> in a competitive <em>Call of Duty</em> match, it’s hard not to mention the team in the conversation. Armed with a formidable SMG duo in the form of Dillon “<strong>Attach</strong>” Price and Eli “<strong>Standy</strong>” Bentz, Røkkr has already proven that it can contend with the teams that finished the regular season at the top of the table and if the team is firing on all cylinders, then a repeat performance of what occurred at the Stage 5 Major could well happen on the main stage once again.</p>
<p>The first hurdle standing in the way of Røkkr is reigning CDL champions the Dallas Empire, another team that has managed to find a recent upturn in form after a fourth-place finish at the last Major. It won’t be an easy task to topple the Empire, but Røkkr has managed to defeat them. The match has all the makings of a five-game thriller and thanks to their incredible composure, Røkkr is more than capable of advancing to the next round.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Dallas Empire</h2>
<p><img src="/media/qmllzndw/dallas-empire-stage-5-major.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.33333333333337" alt="" width="500" height="333.33333333333337" data-caption=""></p>
<p>It’s fair to say that the 2021 season hasn’t been the smoothest of sailing for the defending CDL champions. A number of <a href="/articles/huke-opens-up-about-adderall/" title="Huke Opens Up About Adderall Use During World Championship Run">roster changes</a> combined with a surprisingly uncharacteristic downturn in form during the regular season led many to wonder whether the Dallas Empire had what it took to become back-to-back champions. Under the tutelage of coach Ray “<strong>Rambo</strong>” Lussier and three-time world champ Ian “<a href="/players/crimsix/" title="Crimsix"><strong>Crimsix</strong></a>” Porter, the Empire has managed to reverse its fortunes heading into <em>Black Ops Cold War’</em>s grand finale.</p>
<p>After several questioned the addition of Reece “<strong>Vivid</strong>” Drost to the roster, the submachine gunner has managed to find his feet alongside some of the most mechanically gifted players <em>Call of Duty</em> esports has ever seen and with Minnesota Røkkr standing in the way of the next round, will the Empire crumble under the pressure of the Stage 5 Major winners or dispatch them in a timely fashion?</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Atlanta FaZe</h2>
<p><img src="/media/d1bh2upe/atlanta-faze-major-4.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.0078125" alt="" width="500" height="333.0078125" data-caption=""></p>
<p>As the top seed heading into Champs, it’s impossible to avoid mentioning the juggernaut of the Atlanta FaZe. The 2020 Champs runners-up have dominated the majority of <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>, picking up three Major victories during the regular season. With an AK-74u in hand, the tiny terrors of Chris “<strong>Simp</strong>” Lehr and Tyler “<strong>aBeZy</strong>” Pharris have cemented themselves as one of the greatest SMG partnerships in the history of the esport, with very few able to match their unrelenting levels of aggression and movement on the map.</p>
<p>Often overshadowed is McArthur “<strong>Cellium</strong>” Jovel, FaZe’s flex player. When he’s playing well, it’s very difficult to stop Atlanta from achieving anything less than a place on the top step of the podium.</p>
<p>In their opening match, Atlanta faces off against either the New York Subliners or OpTic Chicago, both extremely difficult matches with both teams looking to end the season on a high. If they can defeat their opponents, there’s the potential of a showdown against the Toronto Ultra in round three, which could be one of the most competitive matches of the entire season.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Toronto Ultra</h2>
<p><img src="/media/4kvhosax/toronto-ultra-cdl-champs-juan-valero.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=333.3333333333333" alt="" width="500" height="333.3333333333333" data-caption=""></p>
<p>During the<em> Black Ops Cold War</em> season, the Toronto Ultra has been the only team successful in breaking away from the hectic mid-table scrap and into the upper echelon of teams alongside the likes of Atlanta. Fans were quick to dismiss the Ultra as a serious title contender after fielding an all-European roster, especially with the addition of Jamie “<strong>Insight</strong>” Craven. However, since his arrival, the flex player has had an incredible rookie season, showcasing that there’s plenty of talent within the European scene.</p>
<p>Despite taking the win at the Stage 2 Major and rarely placing outside of the top four, confidence within the Toronto camp may have taken a hit prior to Champs after falling victim to Minnesota Røkkr’s incredible reverse-sweep in the grand final of the Stage 5 Major. Awaiting Toronto in the second round will either be a Røkkr rematch or a battle against Dallas. Considering the Ultra’s incredible execution of in-game strategies, there is every chance that the team makes a deep run in the tournament, but it certainly won’t be easy.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>OpTic Chicago</h2>
<p><img src="/media/s5kazgek/optic-chicago-cdl-champs-juan-valero.jpeg?width=500&amp;height=333.3984375" alt="" width="500" height="333.3984375" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Last and by no means least is <a href="/teams/optic-chicago/" title="OpTic Chicago">OpTic Chicago</a>, a team that has been on the verge of securing a victory. It’s been a hugely turbulent season for the Green Wall, with dips in form causing many fans that a <a href="/articles/does-optic-chicago-need-new-blood-to-rediscover-success/" title="Does OpTic Chicago Need New Blood To Rediscover Success?">roster change</a> needs to take place. Despite this, the team has withstood the storm and has placed no lower than fourth since the end of Stage 3.</p>
<p>Seth “<a href="/players/scump/" title="Scump"><strong>Scump</strong></a>” Abner has proved that he still has what it takes to compete with the new generation of players breaking into the CDL with sublime displays of submachine slaying often turning the tide of a match in the favour of his team. To kick off Champs, OpTic plays a New York Subliners team <a href="/articles/saintt-claims-subliners-will-win-champs-after-clayster-announces-return/" title="Saintt Claims Subliners Will Win Champs After Clayster Announces Return">featuring a returning</a> James “<a href="/players/clayster/" title="Clayster"><strong>Clayster</strong></a>” Eubanks, a player that has competed at every single world championship since 2011. Can the Green Wall stand strong against one of the potential dark horses of the tournament? If they can, OpTic will move on to face Atlanta in another chapter of the storied rivalry between the biggest names in <em>Call of Duty</em>. The potential to go far is certainly there, but whether the Green Wall can defeat the top seed is another matter.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The best <em>Apex Legends </em>players are hotly contested right now, as the <a href="/guides/apex-legends-player-count-how-many-people-play/"><em>Apex Legends </em>player count</a> continues to surge in popularity and the competition gets fiercer. The best of the best in <a href="/apex-legends/" title="Apex Legends"><em>Apex Legends </em></a>is tough to discern, as watching them all play the game is like watching a mad blur of colours and gunfire - but it certainly doesn’t keep it from being entertaining. But who are the top players in <em>Apex </em>right now, the absolute best of the best?</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Here are the very best <em>Apex Legends </em>players the game has to offer, and who to be keeping an eye out for…</p>
<h2>Best Apex Legends Players: ImperialHal</h2>
<p><img src="/media/tlenijyd/imperialhal.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.33333333333337" alt="The Best Apex Legends Players" width="500" height="333.33333333333337" data-caption="TSM"></p>
<p>ImperialHal, ever since joining <a href="/articles/tsm-signs-chess-grandmaster-hikaru-nakamura-solidifying-chess-as-an-esport/">TSM</a>, has proven himself to be a force to be reckoned with. He has all the know-how that makes up an Apex pro, and is an excellent coordinator in the field, making his lethal with a team.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>22-year-old Phillip Dosen is a behemoth when put to use at <a href="/articles/apex-legends-announce-5million-prize-pool-for-algs-season-2/">ALGS</a>, known mostly for playing as Wraith and Octane. He’s a strict and efficient leader who won’t take a loss so easily, but when his orders are followed, he’ll carry his team to victory with ease.</p>
<h2>Best Apex Legends Players: ShivFPS</h2>
<p><img src="/media/urnies1c/shivfps.png?width=449&amp;height=331" alt="The Best Apex Legends Players" width="449" height="331" data-caption="ShivFPS on Twitter"></p>
<p>Shivam Patel, better known by his online alias ShivFPS, hasn’t half made a name for himself. He’s immensely popular on Twitch, and for good reason - the <a href="/articles/twitch-streamer-xqc-signs-with-luminosity-gaming/">Luminosity Gaming</a> streamer is ruthless and aggressive, and can take care of even the most broken aimbotters.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>If at any point you’re desperate to see some impeccable <em>Apex </em>plays, chances are, he’ll already be live on stream for you to tune in and bear witness.</p>
<h2>Best Apex Legends Players: Hardecki</h2>
<p><img src="/media/lylpt03o/hardecki.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.33333333333337" alt="The Best Apex Legends Players" width="500" height="333.33333333333337" data-caption="Gambit Esports"></p>
<p>Hardecki might be restricted for now to the European leagues, but once the seal is broken, he is on track to be known as a serious all-timer. An iconic member of <a href="/articles/cologne-preview-why-gambit-are-the-best-in-the-world-part-1/">Gambit Esports</a>, Konstantin ‘Hardecki’ is a slick and speedy adversary, and one of the very best Valkyries playing right now.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Be grateful you’ve never run into him in-game, because he’d run rings around even the most seasoned predator.</p>
<h2>Best Apex Legends Players: NRG Ace</h2>
<p><img src="/media/lxrflp5p/ace.jpg?width=450&amp;height=300" alt="The Best Apex Legends Players" width="450" height="300" data-caption="NRG"></p>
<p>He might be retired from professional play now, but Ace is arguably one of the best to ever play <em>Apex Legends</em>. The Wraith main who carried <a href="/articles/shaquille-oneal-esports/">NRG</a> to glory on more than one occasion, Brandon Winn can pull off some immaculate long-shots and is an ace with his snipers and pistols.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>He’s sticking to the streams after his pro career has come to an end, but that only means you’re in more danger of running into him in-game. Good luck to you if you do.</p>

<p>When it comes to players with god-like agility, Song ‘Ras’ Hong-gyun is among the slipperiest. Crazy Racoons’ Ras is great at <em>Apex </em>mostly due to his sheer movement skills, not taking much damage simply because he doesn’t give their adversaries a chance.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>A nightmare for sniper players and even more deadly up close and personal, Ras is a demon in <em>Apex Legends</em> and doesn’t go down without a fight - in fact, they don’t go down often at all.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>These <em>Pokemon UNITE </em>Lucario builds will come in handy for anyone wanting to use one of the most popular <em><a href="/pokemon/" title="Pokemon">Pokemon</a> </em>in the entire franchise, especially from the second generation onwards. Its powerful moves and heroic persona have made it a fan favourite, which may make it a popular choice again in <a href="/pokemon-unite/" title="Pokemon UNITE"><em>Pokemon UNITE</em></a>. However, picking Lucario without full knowledge of how <em>UNITE</em> works is a dangerous gambit, as the Aura assassin has a steep learning curve that beginners will not be expecting. Getting over that curve is worth it though, as Lucario is an absolute beast in the right hands. Here are the best <em>Pokemon UNITE </em>Lucario builds.</p>

<h2><strong>POKEMON UNITE LUCARIO BUILDS: STATS AND MOVESET</strong></h2>

<p>First, let's lay out what Lucario has to offer:</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: All-Rounder<br><strong>Style</strong>: Melee<br><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Expert</p>
<h3><strong>STATS</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Offense</strong> - 6</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Endurance</strong> - 5</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Mobility</strong> - 7</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Scoring</strong> - 6</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Support</strong> - 1</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>EVOLUTION LEVELS</strong></h3>
<p>None</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h3><strong>SPECIAL MOVES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Passive Skill: </strong><strong>Steadfast</strong> - Lucario moves faster and gains a shield whenever its HP is low.</p>
<p><strong>Unite Move: </strong><strong>Aura Cannon</strong> - Lucario launches a massive energy blast that inflicts area-of-effect damage. If Power-Up Punch was chosen as a special move, its next use has increased damage.</p>
<p><strong>Quick Attack</strong> - A quick lunge forward for good damage. Cooldown is 6 seconds. Upgrades at Lvl. 5 to one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Extreme Speed</strong> - Lucario performs a speedy dash attack. If used directly next to an opponent, the move restores HP and resets cooldown. 9 second cooldown. At Lvl. 11 Lucario's basic attack power is increased temporarily after use.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Power-Up Punch</strong> - Lucario charges and releases a punch that damages opponents, knocking them back. Lucario's next basic attack will be boosted. 7 second cooldown. At Lvl. 11 Lucario will not be stunned, knocked back, or launched while charging the move.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Meteor Smash</strong> - Lucario dashes ahead and punches, pushing opponents back while dealing damage. Cooldown is 7 seconds. Upgrades at Lvl. 7 to one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Bone Rush</strong> - Lucario uses a bone for a multi-hit attack that can stun opponents. The last use sends the bone into the air, and Lucario immediately rushes to where it lands before the final blow. 10 second cooldown. At Lvl. 13 all of Lucario's moves have cooldowns reset after it rushes to where the bone lands.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Close Combat</strong> - Lucario performs a multi-hit combo that pushes opponents back while dealing damage. 9 second cooldown. At Lvl. 13 Lucario cannot be stunned, knocked back, or launched while attacking, and gains a shield after use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we know what we're working with, let's see the best options for making your Lucario's aura assault the strongest it can be.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2><strong>POKEMON UNITE LUCARIO BUILDS: AURA ASSIST</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img src="/media/5y2ofix4/unitelucario1.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25?width=500&amp;height=281" alt="Pokemon Unite Lucario builds: Aura Assist" width="500" height="281" data-caption=""></strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus: Attacker Support</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Area: Middle of Map (switching lanes)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 1 Upgrade: Power-Up Punch</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 2 Upgrade: Bone Rush</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Battle Item: Eject Button</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Held Items</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Float Stone</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Muscle Band</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Rocky Helmet</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>As an all-rounder Lucario can serve many different purposes, but it's at its best hovering around the middle of the map, powering up by defeating wild Pokemon, and then supporting its teammates in whichever lane they need help. It may encounter the occasional opponent while jungling in the middle lane, but with enough leveling up an one-on-one encounter shouldn't be a problem.</p>
<p>Use Bone Rush on isolated opponents in a skirmish and have your teammates funnel the other enemies to wherever the bone lands on its final hit. Once enough enemies surround the bone, use Bone Rush again to damage them all and immediately follow up with Power-Up Punch to separate the pack. It's a tough combo to pull off--Lucario is "expert" skill level for a reason--but if you can do it you'll be tearing through enemy teams with ease. </p>
<p>The major issue with this build is the constant movement, anticipating where your team might need assistance and joining them immediately. Lucario has decent speed, but outside of Speedsters movement isn't ideal for anyone in <em>Pokemon UNITE</em>. Float Stone will increase Lucario's speed a bit, while the Eject Button can give a quick zip toward a teamfight in progress...or out of one as the case may need.</p>

<h2>POKEMON UNITE LUCARIO BUILDS: ONE-ON-ONE ASSAULT</h2>
<p><img src="/media/21enzfhx/unitelucario2.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25?width=500&amp;height=281" alt="Pokemon Unite Lucario builds: One-on-One Assault" width="500" height="281" data-caption=""></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus: One-on-One Attacking</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Area: Middle of Map (switching lanes)</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 1 Upgrade: ExtremeSpeed</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 2 Upgrade: Bone Rush</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Battle Item: Eject Button</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Held Items</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Muscle Band</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Rocky Helmet</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Scope Lens</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>You'll notice this build isn't much different than the previous one, the majority of choices being the same. However there are two key elements to this build that turn Lucario from a supporting attacker to a sniper assassin: ExtremeSpeed and Scope Lens.</p>
<p>ExtremeSpeed's strategy is similar to the Bone Rush/Power-Up Punch combo from before: Bone Rush until the bone falls to the ground, get an enemy near it, use Bone Rush again immediately followed by ExtremeSpeed. The difference here is the extra buffs to ExtremeSpeed when used directly next to an enemy, healing Lucario and immediately letting it use the attack again. This creates an insurmountable barrage that few enemies can withstand, and the combo of Muscle Band's attack boost and Scope Lens enhancing Critical Hit rate will only make this combo more potent.</p>
<p>The problem lies in Lucario targeting single enemies in the field; if they're not truly alone, Lucario is hanging itself out to dry. It's not a great feeling to see a target, approach, then watch two of the target's teammates walk out of the tall grass in support. Rocky Helmet's defense boost and damage trading can help a little bit, but nothing really counters being ganged up on by enemies hiding in the reeds. Use that Eject Button in a pinch if you see multiple enemies descending on you; you do not want to end up in that disadvantage.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>These <em>Pokemon UNITE </em>Zeraora builds are exactly what you need to master one of the most overpowered Pokemon in the meta, and also one of the most controversial. This makes sense considering it's fast even for a Speedster in <em><a href="/pokemon-unite/" title="Pokemon UNITE">Pokemon UNITE</a></em>, and it can hit like a truck with the right items equipped. A leveled-up Zeraora is an absolute nightmare in the late game thanks to some extremely powerful moves - something Zeraora fans are no stranger to in <a href="/pokemon/" title="Pokemon"><em>Pokemon</em></a> - but its low endurance means it can be beaten. If you want to see what this shockingly powerful Pokemon is all about, check out these best <em>Pokemon UNITE </em>Zeraora builds.</p>

<p>First, let's check out Zeraora's moves and stats:</p>
<p><strong>Role</strong>: Speedster<br><strong>Style</strong>: Melee<br><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Expert</p>
<h3><strong>STATS</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Offense</strong> - 7</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Endurance</strong> - 3</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Mobility</strong> - 8</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Scoring</strong> - 6</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Support</strong> - 1</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>EVOLUTION LEVELS</strong></h3>
<p>None</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h3><strong>SPECIAL MOVES</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Passive Skill: </strong><strong>Volt Absorb</strong> - Zeraora's Attack power increases every time it is damaged.</p>
<p><strong>Unite Move: </strong><strong>Plasma Gale</strong> - Zeraora generates a blast of electricity that deals initial damage, but also leaves a lightning field that deals additional damage over time.</p>
<p><strong>Agility</strong> - Zeraora quickly dashes forward to deal melee damage. This attack also raises Zeraora's movement speed. Cooldown is 6 seconds. Upgrades at Lvl. 6 to one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Volt Switch</strong> - Zeraora launches a quick and powerful dash attack that also increases basic attack speed. If the move activates again within a certain timeframe, Zeraora will return to the spot of the first use. 8 second cooldown. At Lvl. 12 the move deals more damage and the basic attack speed buff lasts longer.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Spark</strong> - Zeraora jumps towards a nearby opponent and uses an electric attack. By pressing the basic attack button in-air, Zeraora will switch targets and attack the next closest opponent. This move can be used three times before cooldown. 10 second cooldown. At Lvl. 12 changing direction in-air will heal Zeraora.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Slash</strong> - Zeraora pounces with a slashing combo, the last hit of which throws opponents back. Cooldown is 8.5 seconds. Upgrades at Lvl. 8 to one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Discharge</strong> - Zeraora discharges electrical energy, damaging opponents and giving Zeraora a temporary shield. If a damaged opponent was previously paralyzed the move pulls that enemy to Zeraora's position, dealing more damage and stunning the enemy. 8.5 second cooldown. At Lvl. 14 a successful Discharge will also lower an opponent's movement speed.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Wild Charge</strong> - Zeraora charges forward, launching a combo upon contact. Zeraora takes recoil damage with every use. If Volt Switch, Spark, or a boosted basic attack was used before Wild Charge activates, the combo at the end hits more times. 8.5 second cooldown. At Lvl. 14 while the combo is active the move also deals area-of-effect damage to nearby enemies.</li>
</ul>
<p>With Zeraora's electrifying abilities now laid out, let's take a look at how to maximize its potential.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2><strong>POKEMON UNITE ZERAORA BUILDS: RUNNING WILD</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><img src="/media/ayyj4y3m/unitezeraora1.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25?width=500&amp;height=281" alt="Best Pokemon UNITE Zeraora builds" width="500" height="281" data-caption=""><br></strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus: Jungling/Attack Support</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Area: Mid Lane</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 1 Upgrade: Volt Switch</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 2 Upgrade: Wild Charge</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Battle Item: Fluffy Tail</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Held Items</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Attack Weight</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Muscle Band</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Scope Lens</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>It's like the old song goes, "in the jungle, the mighty jungle, Zeraora ganks toniiiiiight." Okay, maybe there's some paraphrasing, but this Zeraora build is an absolute terror to any Wild Pokemon on the board. This also makes Zeraora a scoring machine, so expect to be running back and forth scoring goals while rumbling in the jungle.</p>
<p>Engage every wild Pokemon you see in this build, leveling up as much as you possibly can in the early and mid stages of the game. There's a key reason for this: Wild Charge's enhanced version is one of the best options in the game for taking out multiple opponents at once, so getting to Lvl. 14 is essential. By the time the final two minutes hits, Zeraora will not only be powerful enough to take Zapdos, but it will be able to clear any opponent off the board in no time. </p>
<p>The problem with this build--and with Zeraora in general--is that pesky "3" next to its Endurance stat. It's not going to be able to take a ton of damage before succumbing, and focusing on wild Pokemon with Fluffy Tail means sacrificing the ever-helpful Eject Button. Zeraora has a built-in escape option in Volt Switch, but it's still risky if it finds itself alone. </p>

<h2><strong>POKEMON UNITE ZERAORA BUILDS: ELECTRIC ASSISTANCE</strong></h2>
<p><img src="/media/35if4ws5/unitezeraora2.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25?width=500&amp;height=281" alt="Best Pokemon Unite Zeraora builds" width="500" height="281" data-caption=""></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Focus: Attack Support</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Area: Mid Lane</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 1 Upgrade: Spark</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Move 2 Upgrade: Discharge</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Battle Item: Eject Button</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1">Held Items</li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Attack Weight</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Muscle Band</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2">Score Shield</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>This build still specializes in jungling--Zeraora is a Speedster after all--but this build is more focused on both goal-scoring and teamfights in the later stages of the match. Score Shield will protect Zeraora while trying to score, while Attack Weight will boost its power after a slam dunk.</p>
<p>Both Spark and Discharge are fundamental to this build, as they both can target multiple enemies at a time. Spark's misdirection abilities could even save it when it's outnumbered, switching targets to whichever Pokemon is furthest from the group and staging an escape after the attack hits. Discharge on the other hand is a great way to prevent escape, pulling in Pokemon suffering paralysis and making them vulnerable. </p>
<p>The main problems again center around Zeraora's endurance--or lack thereof. No matter how powerful Zeraora becomes, it will not be able to survive if left alone against multiple enemies. Make sure you always have a teammate with you, and if your friends start to fall, use that Eject Button and live to teamfight another day. Zeraora is meant to score goals, not give free energy to the opponents.</p>

Whether it be through rattling other streamers through strong opinions, or crossing the <a href="/articles/twitch-has-suspended-advertising-on-amouranth-s-channel/" title="Twitch Has Suspended Advertising On Amouranth's Channel">borderlines of Twitch's guidelines</a> with Hot Tub streams, Amouranth has the knack for entertainment, although the drama that often follows has made her a target for internet trolls.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Despite being one of the more popular streamers on the platform, Amouranth is often met with <a href="/articles/amouranth-gets-bizarre-request-from-another-twitch-streamer/" title="Amouranth Gets Bizarre Request From Another Twitch Streamer">many strange requests</a> and messages on stream. However, the ASMR content creator has now had her offline life targeted, as a 'suspected arson attack' broke out at her house.</p>
<p>According to Amouranth, a fire had broken out next to her house, with police investigations pointing towards the reason behind the blaze being arson.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Taking to Twitter, Amouranth said: "Late in the evening there was a fire along the side of my home originating from the area where my trashcan is kept. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, but investigators strongly suspect arson,</p>
<p>"They are reviewing surveillance footage, neighbours surveillance footage and possibly other videos adjacent to the area to try and catch the potential suspect."</p>

</div>
<p>The streamer also added that this isn't the first time her personal life has been attacked. Amouranth continued to suggest like-minded people should get a password/safeword set up with the emergency services after she was hit with multiple fake "swattings" in 2020. A person even used the ruse of July 4 to shoot a firework at the streamer's house.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Amouranth isn't the only high-profile streamer to be targeted away from the screens. Recently, Felix "<a href="/streamers/xqc/" title="XQC"><strong>xQc</strong></a>" and his former partner "<strong>Adept</strong>" were <a href="/articles/xqc-move-out/" title="xQc Forced To Move Out Over ‘Daily Police Swattings’">forced to move out of their apartments following the same swatting reports</a>.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Amouranth was unharmed in the fire, which was contained. She also added that her "fur babies are all okay too."</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The fan remake of <a href="/resident-evil/" title="Resident Evil"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a> is nearly complete, with the person behind it just working on the Separate Ways content. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>In case you're unaware, Separate Ways tells the story of the main game from Ada Wong's POV. Capcom decided to add this particular content for the PlayStation 2 version, that was then added to PC and Wii.</p>
<p>Given the legacy of Ms. Wong in the long-running shooter series, it's great that she got her time to shine after a rather fleeting appearance in the main campaign of <em>RE4</em>. </p>

<h2>When Will The Resident Evil 4 Remake Be Ready?</h2>

<p>The person behind the fan remake, 'albert', has shared an update regarding the struggles he has faced bringing the project to completion. Posting on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.re4hd.com/?p=9203" target="_blank" data-anchor="?p=9203"><em>Reisdent Evil 4</em> HD Project site</a>, they wrote: "Keep in mind, this remastered cutscenes won’t be implemented until some coder finds the way to force the game to load these video files instead of the original 512 x 336 pixel low resolution pre-rendered videos.</p>
<p>"The coder that was working for me almost got it, so it’s a matter of time some other coder (or maybe the same one when she has the time) polish her work and the videos can be used."</p>

</div>
<h2>How Does The Fan Remake Of Resident Evil 4 Look?</h2>
<p>This is pretty straight-forward, it looks amazing. A lot of time and effort has clearly gone into this remake, and it shows. Sharing the comparison shots, albert wrote how he has been achieving the brilliant quality, and it really is something else.</p>
<p><img src="/media/ghxdst5z/re4.jpg?width=444.44444444444446&amp;height=500" alt="" width="444.44444444444446" height="500" data-caption=""></p>
<p>He added: "There are countless remaster methods used, most times several of them used in the same camera angle: From a simple AI upscale to a complete re-creation. Sometimes several AI methods are used in the same camera angle, because some portions of the image look better using certain AI upscale parameters while other portions look better using another configuration.</p>
<p>"And, of course, most background stages use the HD textures from the HD project (remember the camera data for the SW cutscenes is still there). But most times I need to adjust lights and effects to make them match the original lighting of the low-res pre-rendered videos before capturing the backgrounds, and sometimes I need to adjust lights and effects for just for one camera angle…! Well, I could do an entire series of videos explaining the process…"</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you didn't think the ruthless and untamed plains of the Wild West were brutal enough inside the world of <a rel="noopener" href="/red-dead/" target="_blank" title="Red Dead"><em>Red Dead</em></a>, players have discovered a gruesome new aspect of <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. Taking a leaf out of Thomas Harris' Hannibal Lecter book series, someone's discovered cannibalistic pigs inside 2018's game.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>With a title that's very much aimed at adults, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> was the prequel to 2010's <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>. We once again picked up the story of the Van der Linde gang, and while Arthur Morgan replaced John Marston, the protagonist of the original <em>Red Dead Redemption </em>still had a big part to play. It turns out we were too busy robbing stagecoaches and wrangling rustlers to notice cannibalistic pics. </p>
<h2>Where are the cannibalistic pics in Red Dead Redemption 2?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/otrp55/i_didnt_know_pigs_actually_ate_people_pretty/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_name=713c54473add470f84a5e87fb57f1304&amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;utm_term=otrp55" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<div class="artPost artReddit">
<blockquote class="reddit-card"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/otrp55/i_didnt_know_pigs_actually_ate_people_pretty/?ref_source=embed&amp;ref=share">I didn't know pigs actually ate people, pretty crazy stuff</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/">reddeadredemption</a></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Posting on Reddit, u/Technical-Win2277 showed off their first-person experience of these <em>Hannibal</em>-inspired pigs. In the gruesome clip, five pigs are seen eating on the body of an unknown NPC - who has met their tragic demise and ended up as pig food. </p>
<p>Others pointed out that the poignant piece of pig trivia is relatively commonplace among the die-hard community. You can pick up a small mission in Valentine, where a shady lady asks for your help getting rid of a dead man. Whether you complete the mission or not, dead bodies are gnawed on if they're left nearby a group of hungry pigs. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Still, the Reddit post picked up plenty of traction. One fan wrote, "They will go through bone like butter. Hence the term as greedy as a pig. You know, Hannibal kinda did the whole feed to the 'pigs thing' first, but Snatch did it cooler". Another added, "That mission is 100% a<span> </span>Deadwood<span> reference too" - as a homage to HBO's hit cowboy series.</span></p>
<p>A morbid player then gave us nightmares as they concluded, "I sometimes find a little farm that I like. Take out who ever lives there. Feed them to their pigs to hide the evidence. Then pretend I live there for weeks to come. So far no one's suspects anything." </p>

</div>
<p>Even some three years after <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> rode into town, we're still uncovering plenty of details, Easter eggs, and strange mysteries.

Reports claim the success of a <em>GTA </em>trilogy could lead to a <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> remaster, so we're sure to find some more tantalising trivia. </p>

<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Rockstar Games are known for their realism - with each generation creating a more authentic experience. Still, cannibalistic pigs that behave just like pigs do in real life are even more horrific than the zombies of <em>Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare</em>. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Since joining the <a href="/apex-legends/" title="Apex Legends"><em>Apex Legends</em></a> line-up, the ominous <a href="/guides/apex-legends-seer-abilities-lore/" title="Apex Legends Seer Abilities Guide: How To Use Seer">Seer</a> has been a meddlesome maniac in the battle royale, with many believing his stun and wallhack-esque ultimate ability is "game-breaking".</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p><em>Apex Legends</em> developers have been quick to acknowledge the overpowering nature of the recon operative, admitting that a nerf is pending, although there is some bad news.</p>
<p>Respawn Entertainment's team have confirmed that the upcoming nerfs to Seer's kit have been delayed, due to a problem with the hotfix programme.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>Respawn Admit Seer Nerf Has Been Delayed</h2>
<p>After releasing Season 10, the developers were quick to balance the likes of the L-Star and Prowler, with the pair of weapons being too menacing up-close. At the end of a social media post detailing the changes, Respawn said "A balance pass on Seer is planned for next week!"</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1425140785197027335?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360">
<p dir="ltr">Later today we'll also ship a quick balance patch that:<br /><br />⬇️ Reduces Prowler damage from 15&gt;14<br />🔫 Reduces speed while ADSing with the L-Star<br />🧊 Fixes a map hole near Climatizer<br />💰 Raises prices for the Prowler and L-Star in Arenas<br /><br />A balance pass on Seer is planned for next week!</p>
— Respawn (@Respawn) <a href="https://twitter.com/Respawn/status/1425140785197027335?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 10, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div>
<p>However, with a week passing, players have yet to see any changes to Seer's abilities, allowing him and Bloodhound to run riot through Olympus.</p>
<p>Now, <em>Apex Legends</em> Producer Josh Medina has relayed that the team "Ran into issues with the hotfix build that had seer nerfs so we gotta fix those issues before you get a seer nerf."</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/lowkeydbjosh/status/1427746464407556098?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>As to what is expected to be in the balance is unclear. Many believe that Seer's ultimate ability has too wide of a diameter.</p>
<p>The developers previously admitted that he has an unintended flash within his tactical stun, which will also likely be removed, minimising the blindness of his move.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2>When Will The Seer Nerf Be Implemented?</h2>
<p>Ryan Rigney, Director of Communications at Respawn Entertainment, has Tweeted that the nerf will now be coming next week (commencing August 23, 2021). </p>
<p><em>Apex Legends</em> <a href="/guides/apex-legends-patch-notes/" title="Apex Legends Season 10 Patch Notes Detailed">Season 10</a> has so far been dominated by Seer, although the game is quickly expanding and becoming increasingly popular. The brand-new LMG '<a href="/articles/apex-legends-rampage-lmg/" title="Apex Legends Is Getting A New Weapon - The Rampage LMG">Rampage</a>', has been a fair addition to the game, replacing the Spitfire (which is now in rare care packages).</p>
<p>With just a Seer nerf away from having a near-perfect balance to the game, Apex Legends is set to continue its upwards trajectory to being one of the best battle royales out there.</p>

      <description>Knowing the Splitgate ranks is important if you&#39;re in the process of grinding the new&#160;Halo meets Portal shooter</description>

        <![CDATA[<p>Knowing the <em>Splitgate </em>ranks is important if you're in the process of grinding the new <a href="/halo/" title="Halo"><em>Halo</em></a> meets <em>Portal </em>shooter. The <em>Splitgate </em>ranking system is similar to a lot of ranked modes out there, but once you unlock ranked in <a href="/splitgate/" title="Splitgate"><em>Splitgate</em></a>, you'll need to know how it all works. Any game with ranked in it always feels a bit daunting at first, but once you know how everything actually works, you'll be able to climb that ladder faster than you can triple portal your way across the map, and that's literally faster than light. What are the <em>Splitgate </em>rank symbols and icons? How many <em>Splitgate </em>ranks are in the ranking system? We've got everything you need to know.</p>
<h2>Splitgate Ranks: How does the Splitgate ranking system work?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/dcznb1a5/splitgate-ranking-system-2.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>First of all, you need to actually gain access to the competitive playlist, and you can only do this once you've reached level ten. It doesn't take a huge amount of time to hit level 10 in <em>Splitgate</em>, but if you're not there already, now you know what you're going to need to do to get there. There's no special trick here whatsoever; you just need to keep playing and doing as well as you can until you've hit that level.</p>
<p>Once that's done, you then need to do your five placement matches, which is the beginning of how the <em>Splitgate</em> ranking system works. The more you win in these, the higher your rank will be, so it's in your best interests to play as well as you can in these. We generally recommend trying to play your placements with a team you can trust, but if you're good enough, you can probably solo carry those you get matched with. After those, you'll be plopped into one of the potential ranks, which you can see below.</p>
<p>You'll also want to try and rank up, not just because it gives you bragging rights, which are obviously great, but because you'll get special loot at the end of the season. Much like <a href="/rocket-league/" title="RL"><em>Rocket League</em></a>, <em>Splitgate</em> doles out items at the end of the season based on the rank you achieved, but only if you managed to get ten wins at that rank. That means you'll need to prove you belong there to get the rewards, so keep playing until you've gotten those wins.</p>
<h2>Splitgate Ranks: Icons And Ladder Explained</h2>
<p><img src="/media/q5bhumgy/splitgate-ranks-symbols-icons-ranking-system.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Splitgate ranks: Symbols/icons for every rank" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>As with any ranked game, you've got a fair few steps to climb to get to the top. At the end of each match, you'll gain or lose rank score depending on a few factors. The main thing that counts is your performance and whether or not your win or lose. However, if you beat an under-ranked team or one with fewer members, you may not gain any points, and the opposite is true if you lose against one far better than you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Unranked</li>
<li>Brass (0-999)</li>
<li>Bronze I (1000-1249)<br>
<ul>
<li>Bronze II (1250 – 1499)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Silver I (1500 – 1749)<br>
<ul>
<li>Silver II (1750 – 1999)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Gold I (2000 – 2249)<br>
<ul>
<li>Gold II (2250 – 2499)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Platinum I (2500-2749)<br>
<ul>
<li>Platinum II (2750-2999)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Diamond I (3000-3249)<br>
<ul>
<li>Diamond II (3250-3499)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Master I (3500-3749)<br>
<ul>
<li>Master II (3750-3999)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Champion (4000-5000)</li>
</ul>
<p>If this works like other ranked systems, then these numbers will ebb and flow based on the number of players at any given time, and they could even change dramatically as the season's end, but this is how things are for now.</p>

        <![CDATA[<div>Need an Among Us beginners guide to help you find the impostor? <a href="/among-us/" title="Among Us"><em>Among Us</em></a> is a game that took over the gamingsphere, seemingly out of nowhere. However, now it's several months past its peak. If you didn't get into the game at the time, don't worry. We've got a comprehensive <em>Among Us</em> beginners guide that will tell you exactly how to play <em>Among Us</em>. The PC and Mobile Game <em>Among Us</em> by InnerSloth took over Twitch.tv, and later the entire gaming world. The mafia-style game is the perfect social game, especially if you haven’t got into a fight with your friends recently but are craving a good argument. Hence, why this Among Us beginners guide is so important. It's available on <a href="/steam/" title="Steam">Steam</a>, iOS, <a href="/articles/among-us-switch/" title="Among Us Sold Over 3 Million Copies On Switch In A Month">Nintendo Switch</a>, and Android, the best experience has proven to be whatever platform allows you to communicate with your friends (and soon to be foes) via voice call.</div>

<h2 class="editorH2">Among Us Beginners Guide - How To Play Among Us</h2>
<p><em>Among Us</em> is a five-ten player game, though “the more, the merrier” most definitely applies. At the start of a round, players will be randomly assigned a role, either becoming Imposters or Crewmates. While the latter’s goal is to either finish their tasks or to find all Imposters, the former has to kill Crewmates until only the same amount of good and bad guys are left, or to have the timer on a Sabotage run out - more on that in a moment. </p>
<p>Imposters receive special abilities to accomplish that task, as they are allowed to use the ventilation system to travel between exits and rooms, as well as trigger Sabotages. Depending on the map you are playing, “vents” have different power levels, as some maps have incredibly interconnected systems, while maps like “The Skeld” only allow you to travel between two or three exits. </p>
<p>There are several Sabotages ranging from win conditions like Reactor and Oxygen, to information disrupting ones like Communications and Lights. Moreover, Imposters can close doors of different rooms. On some maps, Crewmates can open these doors by solving a puzzle, on others they will have to wait out the duration.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Crewmates apply pressure to the Imposters by doing tasks which fill the top left taskbar. Once completely filled - the Crew wins. The Crew can also win by voting out the imposter during each voting segment, which can either be trigger via pressing the red button in the spawning room, or finding a corpse and hitting the horn on their bottom right UI. A powerful tool to find out if someone isn’t an Imposter is to have them do “visual tasks.” Tasks such as shooting the asteroids in weapons will trigger an animation that only Crewmen can activate. If you want this to be part of your game, you have to switch them on in the settings. We will show you how.</p>
<h2 class="editorH2">Among Us Beginners Guide - What Are The Rules</h2>
<p>The first step to a fun experience will be to set house rules, as each group tends to play <em>Among Us</em> a little differently. Proven and universally accepted rules are as follows:<br><br>- Do not talk outside the voting times. Try to mute yourself</p>
<p>- Don’t stack on top of each other too much (it makes winning as Imposter impossible)</p>
<p>- Do not stream snipe the people you are playing with</p>
<p>- Avoid screaming over each other</p>
<p>Other points of discussion will be whether you allow “metagaming”, that is if someone can accuse another based on the sound of their voice, or finding their in-game behaviour out of the ordinary. In our experience, meta-gaming gives a great flavour to the game experience and makes every group unique. Some also like to discuss if it is okay to slack on tasks, or if players should be allowed to slack on them based on their ability to play “sheriff” for the town.</p>

<p>Example settings for a lobby of 10 advanced players</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<h2 class="editorH2">Among Us Beginners Guide - Settings</h2>
<p>Once you have decided on your house rules, the host of the lobby has to create a game. Here, the rules are once again highly flexible, though the goal of them should generally be to maintain an Imposter to Crew win rate of 50%. Therefore, the optimal settings don’t exist and have to be adjusted based on your group size and the metagame state that your group is under.</p>
<p>The recommended settings are a good start, but generally play very slowly. You will soon find out what works best for your group, but the most effective values to play around with are discussion time, kill cooldown, vision range, and the number of tasks the crew have to solve. Be aware of what the different values do to the communication of your group. Less discussion time will mean that people will get more frustrated in not having had an opportunity to share their information - but too much information also shuts down Imposters too hard if the crew can keep on top of it.</p>
<p>The most important value will be to find the right ratio of Imposters to Crewmates. We recommend having one Imposter up to seven Crewmates. Only at eight have we found two Imposters to start being fair. At ten players, two Imposters are generally considered enough. </p>
<p>For a fun time, the most important aspect is to have someone, or a couple of people, who keep track of the flow of the game, and adjust values as they come, who should preferably be the lobby leader. A lot of fights can be minimised by de-escalating in-game values and simply starting the next game, so players can’t fight in between matches. A lobby host that has the finger on the pulse of the players will contribute a lot to the enjoyment everyone will be getting out of <em>Among Us</em>.</p>

      <description>Fortnite has revealed its new Limited Time Mode, Imposters, to a chorus of sighs</description>

        <![CDATA[<p><a href="/fortnite/"><em>Fortnite</em></a> has revealed its new Limited Time Mode, Imposters, to a chorus of sighs. We should have expected an <a href="/among-us/"><em>Among Us</em></a> mode in <em>Fortnite</em>, frankly, what with the game’s capital dominance of intellectual properties everywhere and vice-grip on gaming culture. But, the game has fallen flat for many.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>It simply doesn’t square up to the simplicity of the original <em>Among Us</em>, and overcomplicates the formula to such a degree that the mode doesn’t feel much like the game it’s trying to replicate - or even <em>Fortnite </em>for that measure.</p>
<p>And now, it seems like fans of the game aren’t the only ones disappointed by the way that Imposters has turned out.</p>
<h2>Among Us Developer Is Upset By Fortnite’s Imposters Mode</h2>
<p><img src="/media/xjzj5zwk/imposter.jpg?width=500&amp;height=333.33333333333337" alt="Among Us Devs Hurt By Fortnite's Imposter Mode" width="500" height="333.33333333333337" data-caption="Epic Games"></p>
<p>The lack of contact between Epic Games and InnerSloth has clearly made an impact on one of the developers behind <em>Among Us</em>, as they’ve tweeted about how upset they are about the way Imposters has rolled out.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>“It would’ve been really, really cool to collab haha”, says Victoria Tran, Community Director of the game. “Like game mechanics fine, those shouldn’t be gatekept, but at the very least even different themes or terminology makes things more interesting?”</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/TheVTran/status/1427725916994682887?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="360">
<p dir="ltr">like game mechanics fine, those shouldn't be gatekept, but at the very least even different themes or terminology makes things more interesting? 😕</p>
— Victoria Tran 🧋 (@TheVTran) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheVTran/status/1427725916994682887?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 17, 2021</a></blockquote>
</div>
<p>It’s clear that more communication would have drastically improved the process of making Imposters, and even a full-on collab could have truly made it special. Instead, it seems like Epic thought themselves masters of all, and have sadly left InnerSloth on the outside.</p>

<h2>Among Us Devs Slam Epic Games For Taking Undue Credit</h2>
<p><img src="/media/clmjxfol/imposter-fella.jpg?width=500&amp;height=250" alt="Among Us Devs Hurt By Fortnite's Imposter Mode" width="500" height="250" data-caption="Epic Games"></p>
<p>Another member of the <em>Among Us </em>team has stepped forward to express their disappointment in Epic Games, with Adriel Wallick sharing a comic depicting someone stealing credit for someone else’s work. The sentiment is clearly that Epic has done the same.</p>
<p>“Anyway - just feeling pretty bummed today”, she continueD. “Everything in the world was already feeling insurmountable, so this was just another fun reminder of how tiny we all really are.”</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://twitter.com/MsMinotaur/status/1427737592175472641?s=20" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

<p>It’s sad that even the developers of <em>Among Us </em>- one of the biggest games in the world that emerged from last year's pandemic - are made to feel small by <em>Fortnite</em>’s actions. Fingers crossed that Epic Games can come around with some kind of statement, because to be honest, these devoted developers deserve better.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s official - <em>Call of Duty: <a rel="noopener" href="/guides/cod-vanguard-release-date-leaks-setting-weapons-maps/" target="_blank" title="Call of Duty: Vanguard Release Date, Leaks, Setting, Weapons, Maps, And More">Vanguard</a></em>’s reveal is <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/verdansk-warzone/" target="_blank" title="Vanguard Warzone 'Will Completely Replace Verdansk'">coming directly to <em>Warzone </em></a>and making no stops along the way. Our next official look at the upcoming World War II shooter is parachuting down in the form of an in-game event, that will see an armoured vehicle roll into Verdansk for players to destroy.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>We're suitably hyped for the <em>Vanguard</em> x <em>Warzone</em> event, however, it doesn’t look like things are ending here.<a href="/call-of-duty/"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>’s official social media channels are teasing a new event that will take place in <em>Warzone </em>AND give players a veritable treasure trove of goodies.</p>
<h2>What Is Warzone’s ‘Care Package’ Event?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/xblpryjv/care-package.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="What To Unlock In Warzone's Verdansk Event" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="Raven Software"></p>
<p>A new teaser has appeared on <em>Call of Duty</em>’s Twitter page that suggests the appearance of a care package. “Command has sent a care package, but you’ve got to be at the #BattleofVerdansk to claim it” the tweet reads, offering some more images for extra insight.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>“Intel from Command indicates you will be rewarded for taking part in the #BattleofVerdansk. New weapon and knife blueprints, bike skin, timepiece and more. Join the fight, defeat the target, get to the exfil and earn rewards”, the images say.</p>

</div>
<p>An official <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/08/warzone-special-joint-operation-august-19-2021" target="_blank">blog post</a> reveals what you'll win. Participants can unlock "new weapon and knife blueprints, a bike skin, a timepiece, and more" by taking part. If that wasn't enough, there's "a new kind of weapon" that's "bigger than anything we've seen before". Couple this with the train tracks on the teaser images, and we're guessing squads will have to take on some sort of armoured train - similar to battling Galactus on-rails in <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>When Is The Battle Of Verdansk Taking Place?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/l4qnbcit/verdansk.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="What To Unlock In Warzone's Verdansk Event" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="Raven Software"></p>
<p>This fight might be a big one as you’ll be competing with every other squad in the game for the care package, so you’d be wise to bring your pals along for the ride. But you’re going to know when exactly the event is taking place, first.</p>
<p>According to the tweet, the Battle Of Verdansk is taking place on August 19, beginning at 6:30 BST. This aligns with the date of the official <em>Vanguard </em>reveal too, so at least now we have a solid time to gravitate to.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>The <em>Vanguard </em>event is looking like an exciting one, and when paired with the excitement of the reveal for a new <em>Call of Duty </em>game, it could be one of the biggest events that <em>Warzone </em>has seen yet. Bring it on.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Sony is once again embroiled in the argument of backward compatibility, but this time, it's been pushed out of the market by its biggest competition. Although <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/playstation-5-10-million/" target="_blank" title="Sony Has Sold Over 10 Million PlayStation 5 Consoles">Sony seems to be winning the next-gen console war</a> in terms of sales, the Xbox Series just got a major boost.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">

</div>
<p>While the famed House that PlayStation built has done its best to improve complaints with the PlayStation 5, you can now emulate your old PlayStation games on the Xbox Series before you can on the PS5. That's right, <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and Lara Croft's triangle breasts never looked so good.</p>
<h2>How has Xbox added PS1 emulation?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU5Cs1tz66Q" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
<p>We already knew the <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/emulate-playstation-2-xbox-series/" target="_blank" title="You Can Now Emulate PlayStation 2 Games On The Xbox Series">Xbox Series S would have some great emulation potential</a>, however, the added bonus of running the classic PlayStation console is another reason to part with your cash. If you own the Xbox Series X or Series S, you'll be able to play any game from any generation of Xbox. From <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> through to <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>, they're all here.</p>

<p>If you'd ever wondered what a 4K version of <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> or <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> that used to run on PS1 would look like, you don't need to wonder any more. The PS1 is one of the most popular emulation trends in living memory, and now, YouTube's Modern Vintage Gamer has shown us how to do it on Xbox Series. In his latest video, Dimitris Giannakis explains how he's used the 2020 emulator called Duckstation to run them on Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>According to Duckstation's developer, the aim of the emulator is for "playability, speed and long-term maintainability. The goal is to be as accurate as possible while maintaining performance suitable for low-end devices”. Modern Vintage Gamer's video shows off games playing at native 4K resolution while locked to 60 FPS.</p>

<p>Giannakis admits that although PlayStation emulators can be found everywhere these days, he said Duckstation is unparalleled when running on the Xbox Series S. He claims Duckstation has the added ability to upscale titles beyond 4K. Remembering that the PS5 will only play <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/the-best-ps4-games-on-the-ps5/" target="_blank" title="The Best PS4 Games On The PS5 ">its own games and "most" PS4 games</a>, Microsoft just pipped Sony to the post.</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough, there's True Colour Rendering and Texture Filtering - which gets rid of some of that blockiness that dogged the PlayStation's early days. Finally, Duckstation fixes texture warping, which was a prominent issue with old PS1 games. Even though this takes up a tonne of processing power, the Xbox Series S takes it in its stride. </p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Remembering that PS1 games didn't run at 60fps, they'll still run at their original frame rate. Still, Duckstation has the ability to overclock, which means some can run at 60fps. For example, <em>PowerSlave</em> has a 60fps frame cap that can be fully explored via Duckstation. Other game like <em>Chrono Cross</em><span> and </span><em>Gran Turismo</em><em> </em>run with ease.</p>
<p>As with any emulator, Duckstation isn't officially on the Xbox store. You'll have to put your Xbox Series into Developer Mode (and pay Microsoft for the privilege), then install it manually. We've seen Developer Mode run emulators like RetroArch, but according to Modern Vintage Gamer, Duckstation is the pinnacle of emulation. We can't wait to go back to Raccoon City for a dose of '90s nostalgia in 2021.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>There could be a flash of red in <em>Marvel's Avengers</em>, and no, it's not Iron Man zooming across the sky. While Crystal Dynamics' superhero spectacular has had its ups and downs, there are hopes that a bright future will keep the content coming. </p>

<p>We're only just getting to grips with the long-delayed Black Panther update and the <em>War for Wakanda</em> DLC, but if you look close enough, you might spot the future of game hiding in plain sight. Preparing to cast a spell over us all, a Scarlet Witch DLC could be somewhere on the horizon.</p>
<h2>Why do players think Scarlet Witch is coming to Marvel's Avengers?</h2>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem" data-embed-url="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayAvengers/comments/p6auny/wanda_who_because_i_only_know_one/?utm_term=1522238398&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_source=embed&amp;utm_name=&amp;utm_content=header" data-embed-height="240" data-embed-width="360" data-embed-constrain="true">

</div>
</div>
<p>Following the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman last year, Square Enix made the decision to delay the Black Panther DLC. Since the main game's release in August, we've seen the roster of Earth's Mightiest heroes be joined by new faces including <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/marvels-avengers-new-superhero-and-villain/" target="_blank" title="Marvel's Avengers Is Getting A New Superhero And Villain">Hawkeye and Kate Bishop</a>. There's also confirmation that <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/avengers-devs-promise-spider-man-is-still-coming/" target="_blank" title="Avengers Devs Promise Spider-Man Is Still Coming">Spider-Man is still on the way</a>, however, what about Wanda Maximoff using her witchy ways on the game's fanbase?</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Posting on Reddit, u/FWM_Carlton showed off a tiny moment in <em>War for Wakanda</em> that teases the title's future. During the scene, players come across the Wakandan mystic called Zawavari and interrupt his conversation with "Wanda". We don't know about you, but there's only one Wanda that jumps to mind.</p>
<p>Fans loved the idea of a potential Scarlet Witch DLC. Someone wrote, "F**k spiderman! give me Wanda Maximoff!, while another added, "God I hope we get Wanda soon. She's my number 1 most anticipated her. Not everyone was convinced though.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>A sceptic concluded: "Anyone who thinks this confirms scarlet witch as soon is going to be disappointed. Usually voice actors like this will record thousands of lines of dialogue so they don’t have to be recalled in on the project. This just confirms at time of recording CD has a thought they may include her)". </p>
<h2>When could we see Scarlet Witch in Marvel's Avengers?</h2>

</div>
<p>Speculating about when we could get a Scarlet Witch - or dare we wish <em>WandaVision</em> - DLC is all well and good, but until the development team confirm her, there's no point. Remembering that <em>Marvel's Avengers</em> has been out for a full year, Black Panther is only the third new playable hero. We'd also probably lump Hawkeye and Kate Bishop in the same boat.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>There have been obvious delays when it comes to the <em>Avengers</em> roadmap, but we're moving at a snail's pace. Added to this, there have been <a rel="noopener" href="/articles/marvels-avengers-game-breaking/" target="_blank" title="Marvel's Avengers Update Includes A Game-Breaking Glitch">plenty of complaints</a>, meaning critics aren't sure we'll ever get through the leaked list of heroes that have been doing the rounds. Although the list shrinks and grows every month, an impressive lineup includes She-Hulk, the Winter Soldier, Captain Marvel, and more.</p>
<p>Crossbones also makes his mark on <em>War for Wakanda</em>, but with the DLC being so fresh out of the box, we'll have to dig a little deeper to see if there are any more Easter eggs. Interestingly, Zawavari has also made a nod toward Doctor Strange and Loki, so any (or all) of the above could be primed for DLCs. Why not stick them all together and introduce the Multiverse of Madness?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Fortnite</em> Alien Parasites are a big addition in <em>Fortnite </em>Chapter 2 - Season 7. These baby aliens are the offspring of the advanced alien civilization that has invaded the <em><a href="/fortnite/">Fortnite</a></em> world. Week 11’s Epic Quests are all about <em>Fortnite</em> Alien Parasites and will require players to mark an Alien Parasite; dance with an Alien Parasite at Believer Beach, Lazy Lake, or Pleasant Park; and go for a swim with an Alien Parasite.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleVideoBanner"></div>
</div>
<p>Players that know <a href="/guides/how-to-unlock-superman-in-fortnite/">how to unlock Superman in <em>Fortnite</em></a> know that completing Epic Quests is the only way to acquire the Shadow Superman style variant. This guide will not only teach you all about <em>Fortnite</em> Alien Parasites, but it’ll help you knock out three Epic Quests in one go.</p>
<h2><em>Fortnite</em> Alien Parasites: Mark an Alien Parasite </h2>
<p><img src="/media/5iaa1wp1/fortnite-alien-parasite-on-head.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="alien-parasite-on-head" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption=""></p>
<p>Alien Parasites can appear pretty much anywhere on the <em>Fortnite</em> island. They're called parasites, but the relationship isn’t entirely one-sided. In exchange for one’s health, Alien Parasites offer increased movement speed and jump height - plus protection from headshots. </p>
<p>These bloodsucking creatures hatch throughout the match from Alien Parasite eggs. Once born, a<em> Fortnite</em> Alien Parasite will search for a host. That’s usually a chicken, boar, wolf (more on those in our <a href="/guides/fortnite-how-to-tame-animals/" title="Fortnite - How To Tame Animals And Wildlife Locations">how to tame animals in <em>Fortnite</em></a> guide), enemy player — or you.</p>
<p>Search locations like Hydro 16, Lazy Lake, Weeping Woods, and Holly Hatchery for Alien Parasites. Places where wildlife spawns are prime breeding grounds for Alien Parasites.</p>
<p>Find a loose Alien Parasite or pry it off an animal’s head by eliminating its host. Finally, mark/ping the free Alien Parasite before it finds a new host. Controller players can mark by pressing left on the D-pad by default while the mark key is bound to the middle mouse button when using a mouse and keyboard.</p>

<p>Whether you like it or not, Week 11’s Epic Quests have set you up on a date with a <em>Fortnite</em> Alien Parasite. One of these lovely critters has requested you for a dance.</p>
<p>Players will need to search Believer Beach, Lazy Lake, or Pleasant Park for Alien Parasites. It’s possible there won’t be any around, and in that case, you’ll need to expand your search to the surrounding area. However, in the end, you’ll need to travel back to one of these three main locations with an Alien Parasite on your head.</p>
<p>With your newfound partner in tow, perform any emote. This relationship just got a little more symbiotic.</p>

<h2>Fortnite Alien Parasites: Go for a swim with an Alien Parasite</h2>

<p>This fina<em>l Fortnite</em> Alien Parasite challenge sounds like a fun bonding experience, but it’s actually the end of your journey with this new friend. You must now go for a swim with the Alien Parasite on your head.</p>
<p>If you are at Believer Beach or Lazy Lake from the previous challenge, there should already be a large body of water near you. Enter the lake at Lazy Lake or the ocean at Believer Beach to complete this Week 11 Epic Quest. Pleasant Park is surrounded by water on all sides, so just head straight in any direction until you reach a river or the ocean.</p>
<p>Alien Parasites are allergic to water, so the moment you go under, the parasite will detach from your head. It’s time to let your parasite buddy roam free in search of a new living organism to feed on.</p>

<p>This <a href="/guides/fortnite-chapter-2-season-7-challenge-guide-week-5/">isn’t the first</a> or the last time you’ll need to deal with<em> Fortnite</em> Alien Parasites. So, it’s best to get familiar with these buffed-up leeches and learn how to use them to your advantage.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The <em>FIFA 22 </em>Weekend League has some changes coming to it compared to last year, offering a new spin on the classic FUT Champions experience. The elite <a href="/fifa/" title="FIFA"><em>FIFA</em></a> Ultimate Team tournament, in which the best cards in the game are offered up as rewards alongside a mass of coins and consumables, is turning into a two-tiered event in <em>FIFA 22</em>. We've got everything you need to know about the <em>FIFA 22 </em>Weekend League FUT Champions mode right here, including all the changes and how to qualify.</p>

<h2>FIFA 22 Weekend League: FUT Champions Changes</h2>

</div>
<p>Instead of having to grind through Division Rivals every week with your newly-found <a href="/guides/fifa-22-fut-heroes-list/" title="FIFA 22 FUT Heroes List: All FUT Heroes Ratings"><em>FIFA 22 </em>FUT Heroes</a>, players will have to qualify for the <em>FIFA 22</em> Weekend League through the FUT Champs playoffs. Division Rivals points will still have to be notched up in order to qualify for Playoffs, although the assumption is that this will be a reduced rate.</p>
<p>The Playoffs will allow you to compete at your own pace, with an entrance cup on offer throughout the week. Once you have qualified for the FUT Champions Weekend League, or the 'Champions Finals', you will be on track to get those invaluable star rewards (pack and coin rewards will still be on offer through the Playoffs).</p>
<h2>FIFA 22 Weekend League: What Is The FUT Weekend League?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/iswbteeh/fut-champs.jpg?width=500&amp;height=260.14957264957263" alt="" width="500" height="260.14957264957263" data-caption=""></p>
<p>The FUT Weekend League is where all the <em>FIFA 22 </em>big dogs are at. The best of the best qualify for the Weekend League and attempt to hit a higher reward barrier with a certain number of wins.</p>
<p>The untradeable 'Red Cards' gifted through the FUT Weekend League are often a good indication of just how experienced your opponent is, and a keen eye can tell how far your rival has gone through the ranks.</p>
<p>With either the TOTW or any special promotion players up for grabs through the rewards, the FUT Weekend League is one of the best ways to pull in top-tier players without spending a penny - just playing.</p>
<p>Akin to previous years, FIFA 22's rewards for the FUT Weekend League will increase depending on how many wins you get, although this year it appears to be on a points-based system, rather than the number of wins. Through the attached trailer video, you can see 6/10 points are needed, indicating that three points could be on offer per win, and one for a draw, just like real-life football.</p>
<p>So, if you fancy decking out your squad and have your opponents trembling in their gaming chairs before kick-off, the FIFA 22 FUT Weekend League is where you'll need to be.</p>
<p>You can read more about <em>FIFA 22 </em>FUT Heroes on the <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-22/news/pitch-notes-fifa-22-ultimate-team-deep-dive" target="_blank">official website</a>, and keep your eyes peeled on GGRecon for more <em>FIFA 22 </em>guides. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Supergiant Games’ <a href="/articles/next-gen-hades-just-made-pet-the-dog-even-better/"><em>Hades</em></a> hasn’t even been officially out for a year yet, but already, there are games gunning for its throne. The roguelike took the gaming world by storm last year, securing a slew of Game of the Year awards and stunning gaming fans - whether they were interested in the game’s genre or not.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p>Hades has already revolutionised the roguelike genre, and stands as proof that indie games can truly have some serious AAA polish. The best games aren’t always £60, and <em>Hades </em>stands as one of 2020’s greatest proofs.</p>
<p>But, as the game makes its arrival on <a href="/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-now-available-to-all-game-pass-ultimate-owners/">Xbox Game Pass</a> to reach a whole new audience, there are rumblings of a new afterlife-set demon-slayer title that could come for <em>Hades</em>’ title of ultimate aetherial murder simulator.</p>
<h2>Why is Neon White Turning Heads?</h2>
<p><img src="/media/h2gmzldi/clock-tower.jpg?width=500&amp;height=281.25" alt="Neon White Is 'The New Hades' - But Not Really" width="500" height="281.25" data-caption="Annapurna Interactive"></p>
<p>Annapurna Interactive has garnered a name for themselves publishing indie titles that snap up the gaming world, if only for a moment. <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, <em>Outer Wilds </em>and <em>Ashen </em>have all had their time in the sun, and after publishing Ben Esposito’s quirky and wholesome abyss simulator <em>Donut County</em>, they’re gearing up to release his next game - and it’s a hell of a change in atmosphere.</p>
<div class="mceNonEditable embeditem">
<div class="articleBannerPlaceHolder" data-id="articleBanner300x250"></div>
</div>
<p><em>Neon White </em>is set for release later this year, and is adding to the ever-growing list of high-concept battlers. The game seems to be doing a lot, balancing elements of first-person shooters, RPGs, and parkour platformers with a dense card-collecting simulator. It might seem like too much, but the game’s sleek visuals that naturally come with a game set in Heaven itself help to balance the experience a little.</p>
<p>In Neon White, you play as White, an assassin sent from Hell to purge Heaven of a demonic infestation, using your hectic parkour moves and arsenal of weapons to take care of your adversaries. It’s understandable why many have drawn comparison to <em>Hades</em> - after all, slashing through the underworld and blasting through the pearly gates at least have some thematic similarities - but <em>Neon White </em>isn’t adding ‘roguelike’ to the mad cocktail of its influences.</p>

<p>Ben Esposito puts the game perfectly when introducing the game for its gameplay walkthrough. “In 2018, I released <em>Donut County</em>, a wholesome game designed for kids and adults alike. After that, I decided that my next game will not be for kids or adults. It’ll be a game for freaks.”</p>

<p>It’s an accurate description, as the game’s creatures, slightly gothic presentation and the overall atmosphere is so dense and layered that it might take some getting used to - but once you’re in, you’ll be in for good.</p>
<h2>When Is Neon White Coming Out?</h2>

<p><em>Neon White </em>is set to come to Nintendo Switch and Steam in winter 2021, and even though there isn’t a specific date set yet, that’s more than enough to get excited about the game’s release.</p>

<p>While the game might not be locking horns with <em>Hades</em>, there's every chance that <em>Neon White </em>could be something entirely different - and maybe even better. Roll on the Winter!</p>
