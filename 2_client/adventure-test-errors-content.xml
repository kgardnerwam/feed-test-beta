        <![CDATA[ <div class="content ps-gallery"> <section class="row article-intro"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-3"> </article> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 end"> <p><strong>With sales of e-bikes soaring, and previously inaccessible off-road spots now easier for casual riders to access, Jim Cherrington, Senior Lecturer of Sport Sociology at Sheffield Hallam University, dives into the pros and cons. </strong></p> <p>Sales of electric bikes have increased dramatically recently. In 2020, 4.6 million e-bikes were sold in the EU and UK, a <a href="https://cyclingindustry.news/cycling-market-now-worth-e18-3bn-localised-e-bike-production-hits-80/#:%7E:text=E%2DBike%20sales%20leapt%20to,that%20has%20been%20gathering%20pace.">52% rise</a> year on year. In the UK, nearly one in three adult bikes sold are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/08/electric-bike-and-scooter-sales-boom-pushes-halford-back-to-growth-covid-19">now electric</a>.</p> <p>But they are also the subject of much controversy, as e-bikes allow riders to go much further and faster in the countryside. This has led to an intense debate between cyclists, horse riders and walkers about what constitutes acceptable levels of <a href="https://www.imba.com/press-release/early-data-released-impacts-emtb-use-trails">speed, noise and erosion</a> from this new technology.</p> <p>Indeed, on social networking sites and various internet forums, there is also a widespread perception that e-mountain bike riders are <a href="https://www.singletracks.com/mtb-columns/over-a-beer-why-ebikes-are-the-spawn-of-satan-mostly/">selfish, lazy and anti-social</a>. These riders are also accused of being overly reliant on the motor and of travelling at speeds that are unsafe for other users of the countryside &#x2013; which is said to result in damage to biking trails and the wider environment.</p> <h2>Environmental implications</h2> <p>The introduction of a motor and a battery to an all-terrain bicycle may create the potential for many more cyclists to access the great outdoors. But the heavier components, wider tyres and added torque raise <a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/outdoors/a470260/are-electric-mountain-bikes-legal/">concern among</a> many riders about the potential environmental impact.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02604027.2019.1698234">Our research</a> shows that traditional mountain-biking involves a <a href="https://theconversation.com/mountain-bikers-can-strengthen-the-connection-between-humans-nature-and-recreational-space-137206">complex relationship</a> between riders, bikes and terrain. Through careful experimentation and progression, riders learn to be attentive to the limits and abilities of their body and their bike. And in doing so, they gain a deep appreciation for both the feel of the trail and the topography of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213078016300391">the landscape</a>.</p> <p>This has been shown to influence their encounters with other user groups, as mountain bikers make concessions for walkers and horse riders based on a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718514000955">mutual understanding</a> of the terrain. Riders will often give way to walkers travelling uphill and may choose to wait before passing horses on rugged trails to avoid dislodging objects that may strike or startle the animal.</p> <p>The fear with e-bikes is that the addition of a motor makes users complacent about the demands of the terrain, and the needs of other people &#x2013; with riders prioritising getting uphill as quickly as possible, or going as far as they can on a single battery.</p> <p>But while a lot of these fears and complaints may well be valid, most are based on anecdotal evidence rather than any actual research. So as part of our <a href="https://www.ridesheffield.org.uk/sheffield-hallam-university-e-bike-study-volunteers-wanted/">latest project</a>, that hasn&#x2019;t yet been published, we&#x2019;ve spoken with 30 e-bike riders in England to find out more about why people choose e-bikes and how they actually ride them. What our findings indicate so far is that electric mountain bike users are often more responsible than perceptions might suggest.</p> <h2>The benefits</h2> <p>Participants we have spoken to so far have told us how they constantly ask other (non-e-bike) riders how tired they are or how difficult the terrain is to ride, to accommodate the pace and energy levels of the group.</p> <p>When cycling with non-e-bikers, participants also told us that they position themselves at the back to avoid &#x201C;rubbing other people&#x2019;s noses in it&#x201D;, while some have said that they have swapped bikes with others when they are too tired to go on.</p> <p>E-bikes also seem to have a wider social role in relation to crime, ill-health and social exclusion. One participant &#x2013; a disabled former soldier &#x2013; said his e-bike has been the springboard for a new social enterprise that tackles youth offending through cycling. We&#x2019;ve also heard from several older participants who said purchasing an e-bike has led to vast improvements in their physical and mental well-being.</p> <h2>Risks and gains</h2> <p>On the other hand, we&#x2019;ve also had reports of riders barging through groups of walkers. And one of our participants, who works in the bike industry, was aware of two instances where e-mountain bike riders had gone too far into the wilderness, run out of battery, and needed to call the air ambulance.</p> <p>This concern is further illustrated by some of the riders&#x2019; relationships with the battery and on-board computer. Even though our research is still ongoing, numerous participants have described how the Bluetooth link between their bikes and GPS tracking apps such as Strava allowed them to &#x201C;compete&#x201D; more effectively against their friends.</p> <p>These are isolated incidents, but they reinforce <a href="https://www.irma-international.org/viewtitle/210443/?isxn=9781522543480">existing studies</a> that illustrate how tracking devices can be enrolled with other forms of technology in sport and physical activity to enable immoral, disrespectful and irresponsible forms of behaviour. The use of Strava to encourage fast and competitive riding has <a href="https://enduro-mtb.com/en/strava-opinion/">also been linked</a> with increased trail damage and surface erosion.</p> <p>To quote the popular mountain bike commentator Rob Warner, &#x201C;electric mountain bikes represent the most significant thing to happen to mountain biking since mountain biking&#x201D;. They allow people to overcome a range of social and physical barriers and engage in more outdoor exercise.</p> <p>But questions remain as to whether the risk to the environment outweighs the potential gains for culture, health and society. <a href="https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/mtbleadership/article/20210429-mtb-leadership-news-Major-new-research-project-launched--into-E-mountain-bike-use-in-Britain-0">More research</a> is needed to ensure that future conversations are informed by evidence, rather than anecdotes.</p> <p><strong>This article is republished from <a href="https://theconversation.com">The Conversation</a> under a Creative Commons license.

Rome-based reporter Silvia Marchetti investigates. </strong></p> <p>How many times have you had risotto? Chances are, it was a counterfeit. Because the one and only <em>real</em> risotto is made in Milan and the Milanese affectionately call it r<em>isotto alla milanese&#xA0;(</em>cooked the Milanese-way<em>)</em> or&#xA0;<em>risotto allo zafferano</em> (cooked with saffron). In local dialect, it&#x2019;s simply <em>risott giad</em> (aka &#x2018;yellow rice&#x2019;).</p> <p>They&#x2019;re all the same thing. Essentially, a plateful of locally grown rice cooked with a few key ingredients including saffron (the spice that gives it its distinctive yellow color) and veal or vegetable broth to help the flavors amalgamate and create a creamy, gold-colored risotto with a soft texture.</p> <p>But watch out. Milan&#x2019;s dining scene is facing a metamorphosis with thousands of fancy concoctions and twists. In order to taste the original recipe in all its glory, there&#x2019;s only one place you should head to: Ratan&#xE0;, the restaurant of chef Cesare Battisti. A chic 1800s Liberty-style villa overlooking a park, it used to be the lair of a shaman priest (who used the building to run a small tavern) back in the 1930s.</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse medium-uncollapse"><div class="columns medium-6 medium-offset-3 end featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg 1048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-334x500.jpg 334w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-scaled.jpg 1708w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> Milanese chef Cesare Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine. <span class="photographer override">Photo courtesy of Ratan&#xE0;</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Ratan&#xE0; is cozy and chic, and a place in which the old very much meets the new. The restaurant, which enjoyed another former life as railway storage facility, reflects what Battisti calls &#x201C;industrial archaeology&#x201D;. The tables are made with old melted steel from railway tracks, while the view from the restaurant takes in Milan&#x2019;s futuristic modern skyscrapers.</p> <p>Ratan&#xE0; is the temple of <em>risotto alla milanese</em>, and locals who are crazy for this iconic dish flock here. Battisti serves it old-style: With bone marrow, <em>gremolata</em> (a lemon zest, parsley and garlic sauce) and roasted meat sauce. He also makes risotto with <em>ossobuco</em>; that&#x2019;s risotto served with a succulent braised veal shank placed on top that enhances the flavor and melts in the mouth.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/tijuana-food-drink-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How did Tijuana become Mexico&#x2019;s go-to foodie city?&#xA0;</a></strong></p> <p><em>Ossobuco</em> is a delicious, ancient ingredient that was ditched in the early 1900s as it was considered too greasy and subsequently substituted with &#x2018;lighter&#x2019; ones such as extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese.</p> <p>&#x201C;At the beginning, risotto was made with a simple broth. Bone marrow was added at a later stage when families could afford a more nutritive, expensive meal,&#x201D; says Battisti. &#x201C;Then healthy habits kicked in, vegetable broth and so on, but I still like to add <em>ossobuco</em>. It&#x2019;s my signature.&#x201D;</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-500x375.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-768x575.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1536x1150.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Milan&apos;s Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Milan&#x2019;s Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Ouael Ben Salah</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Milan born-and-bred, Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine.

Michelin-starred experiments are mere culinary pornography. Those chefs see their own ego reflected in their dishes. Their cooking is a narcissistic, snob act meant to confuse and intimidate eaters.&#x201D;</p> <p>Considered an authority when it comes to risotto, Battisti is down-to-earth but can be provocative.
