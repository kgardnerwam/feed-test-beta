Rome-based reporter Silvia Marchetti investigates. </strong></p> <p>How many times have you had risotto? Chances are, it was a counterfeit. Because the one and only <em>real</em> risotto is made in Milan and the Milanese affectionately call it r<em>isotto alla milanese&#xA0;(</em>cooked the Milanese-way<em>)</em> or&#xA0;<em>risotto allo zafferano</em> (cooked with saffron). In local dialect, it&#x2019;s simply <em>risott giad</em> (aka &#x2018;yellow rice&#x2019;).</p> <p>They&#x2019;re all the same thing. Essentially, a plateful of locally grown rice cooked with a few key ingredients including saffron (the spice that gives it its distinctive yellow color) and veal or vegetable broth to help the flavors amalgamate and create a creamy, gold-colored risotto with a soft texture.</p> <p>But watch out. Milan&#x2019;s dining scene is facing a metamorphosis with thousands of fancy concoctions and twists. In order to taste the original recipe in all its glory, there&#x2019;s only one place you should head to: Ratan&#xE0;, the restaurant of chef Cesare Battisti. A chic 1800s Liberty-style villa overlooking a park, it used to be the lair of a shaman priest (who used the building to run a small tavern) back in the 1930s.</p> </article> </section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse medium-uncollapse"><div class="columns medium-6 medium-offset-3 end featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Battisti_fo-1048x1570.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1048x1570.jpg 1048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-334x500.jpg 334w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-768x1151.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1025x1536.jpg 1025w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Cesare-Battisti_foto-scaled.jpg 1708w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> Milanese chef Cesare Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine. <span class="photographer override">Photo courtesy of Ratan&#xE0;</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Ratan&#xE0; is cozy and chic, and a place in which the old very much meets the new. The restaurant, which enjoyed another former life as railway storage facility, reflects what Battisti calls &#x201C;industrial archaeology&#x201D;. The tables are made with old melted steel from railway tracks, while the view from the restaurant takes in Milan&#x2019;s futuristic modern skyscrapers.</p> <p>Ratan&#xE0; is the temple of <em>risotto alla milanese</em>, and locals who are crazy for this iconic dish flock here. Battisti serves it old-style: With bone marrow, <em>gremolata</em> (a lemon zest, parsley and garlic sauce) and roasted meat sauce. He also makes risotto with <em>ossobuco</em>; that&#x2019;s risotto served with a succulent braised veal shank placed on top that enhances the flavor and melts in the mouth.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>RELATED: <a href="https://adventure.com/tijuana-food-drink-mexico/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How did Tijuana become Mexico&#x2019;s go-to foodie city?&#xA0;</a></strong></p> <p><em>Ossobuco</em> is a delicious, ancient ingredient that was ditched in the early 1900s as it was considered too greasy and subsequently substituted with &#x2018;lighter&#x2019; ones such as extra virgin olive oil and Grana Padano cheese.</p> <p>&#x201C;At the beginning, risotto was made with a simple broth. Bone marrow was added at a later stage when families could afford a more nutritive, expensive meal,&#x201D; says Battisti. &#x201C;Then healthy habits kicked in, vegetable broth and so on, but I still like to add <em>ossobuco</em>. It&#x2019;s my signature.&#x201D;</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1180x884.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-500x375.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-768x575.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-1536x1150.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-2048x1534.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ouael-ben-salah-0xe2FGo7Vc0-unsplash-2-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Milan&apos;s Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary."></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Milan&#x2019;s Metropolitan Cathedral-Basilica of the Nativity of Saint Mary. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Ouael Ben Salah</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Milan born-and-bred, Battisti is on a mission to defend traditional Milanese recipes from the extravagance and &#x201C;contamination&#x201D; of Michelin-starred cuisine. When it comes to traditions, he&#x2019;s dead serious about protecting his ancestors&#x2019; legacy. &#x201C;Risotto is sacrosanct, it&#x2019;s embedded in the Milanese soul,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;We eat it year-round so we&#x2019;re quite fittingly called <em>risottari</em> [&#x2018;those who eat risotto&#x2019;], and that&#x2019;s a source of pride.&#x201D;</p> <p>He believes the roots of <em>risottari </em>are deeply anchored in Milan&#x2019;s culinary heritage and can&#x2019;t be removed.</p> <blockquote> <p>&#x201C;I was so intrigued by the stories on how risotto came to be that I wanted to draw a line between legend and history.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x2013; Cesare Battisti</p> </blockquote> <p>&#x201C;Old-style risotto can only be made in a specific way, and that way hasn&#x2019;t changed across centuries,&#x201D; Battisti explains. &#x201C;Peasants, bourgeois and aristocrats have been handing down the recipe across generations. Michelin-starred experiments are mere culinary pornography. Those chefs see their own ego reflected in their dishes. Their cooking is a narcissistic, snob act meant to confuse and intimidate eaters.&#x201D;</p> <p>Considered an authority when it comes to risotto, Battisti is down-to-earth but can be provocative. Fueled by a passion for Milan&#x2019;s culinary history, he embarked on an academic quest to trace the real origins of risotto.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse small-up-1 medium-uncollapse"><div class="column featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--1180x854.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--1180x854.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--1180x854.jpg 1180w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--500x362.jpg 500w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--768x556.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--1536x1112.jpg 1536w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--2048x1483.jpg 2048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Ratana&#x300;_Old-style-Milanese-risotto--scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">Using local ingredients is also key to making a great risotto.

Back then, groups of painters were divided by color: There was the blue team, the green, red and so on. Valerio led the yellow team, and saffron was used to create the color yellow. He saw the white rice as a blank canvas to paint.&#x201D;</p> <p>Exotic spices were all the rage during the Renaissance and used to paint garments, carpets and curtains. So why not risotto? And so, to impress the diners at the banquet, the painter sprinkled some saffron powder on the rice, transforming it into a fancy, gold-colored dish.</p> </article></section> <figure> <div class="row small-collapse medium-uncollapse"><div class="columns medium-6 medium-offset-3 end featured-image"><img class="featured-image " data-lazy-src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-1048x1570.jpg" src="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-1048x1570.jpg" srcset="https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-1048x1570.jpg 1048w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-334x500.jpg 334w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-768x1150.jpg 768w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-1026x1536.jpg 1026w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-1367x2048.jpg 1367w, https://adventure.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/vera-de-hTE438DvDgg-unsplash-2-scaled.jpg 1709w" sizes="(max-width: 1180) 100vw, 1180" alt="Saffron"></div> </div> <figcaption class="row"><div class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3">According to Battisti, Sardinian saffron is the best in the world, thanks to its well-shaped bulbs. <span class="photographer override">Photo: Vera De</span></div></figcaption> </figure> <section class="row "> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> <p>Thanks to Battisti, I also learned that a type of saffron is now produced in Italy too, cultivated both in the central region of Marche and on the island of Sardinia, where entire meadows are dotted red.

Battisti buys only indigenous rice such as Carnaroli, which best absorbs the other flavors. It&#x2019;s grown around Milan, ensuring zero food miles.</p> <p>The Milanese have a love affair with saffron, which explains why it had to pair well with their risotto. &#x201C;In the past rich families had a knack for adding saffron to food sauces, even to tea, as a remedy against depression,&#x201D; says Battisti. &#x201C;Try old-style risotto, and you&#x2019;ll see what I mean&#x201D;.</p> <p>According to other origin tales (based less on historical facts, says Battisti), the saffron addition was either a joke or a mistake. A painter colleague of Valerio might have added the spice to his rice meal at lunch break, or Valerio himself accidentally dropped the saffron into his dish&#x2014;and then marveled at the taste.</p> <p>Regardless, Battisti is proud of the discovery he made at L&#x2019;Ambrosiana and believes it supports his culinary doctrine that <em>risotto alla milanese</em> is the perfect balance between innovation and tradition.</p> </article></section> <section class="row article-base"> <article class="columns small-12 medium-6 medium-offset-3"> </article> </section> <section class="row"> <article class="columns small-12"> </article> </section> </div> ]]>

We don&#x2019;t even need to take a deep dive into the latest catastrophe to start spiraling with existential dread and anxiety&#x2014;just skimming headlines and hearing things word-of-mouth can do the trick.</p> <p>Last month, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10410236.2022.2106086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a study</a> in <em>Health Communications </em>confirmed what a lot of us probably suspected: Consuming too much news is bad for our mental and physical wellbeing.&#xA0;</p> <p>By &#x201C;consuming too much news,&#x201D; we don&#x2019;t mean reading the paper or scrolling through a news app with our morning coffee. We&#x2019;re talking about compulsively checking the news and being unable to think about anything else, to the point that it&#x2019;s interfering with other aspects of your life. The study focused on the one out of six respondents whose news habits had reached this degree of severity, but anyone who has gone on a news binge in the last few years knows that the news takes a toll long before it reaches the point of an addiction.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p> <p>News addictions are different from many other forms of addiction when it comes to treatment, where the goal is often complete abstinence. There are real and important benefits for staying up-to-date on current events&#x2014;the question is how to get the positives without suffering the side effects.</p> </article> </div> <div> <article class="columns small-12 medium-8 medium-offset-2"> </article> </div> <div> <article class="columns small-12 medium-8 medium-offset-2"> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#x201C;Not only does tuning out come at the expense of an individual&#x2019;s access to important information for their health and safety, it also undermines the existence of an informed citizenry, which has implications for maintaining a healthy democracy,&#x201D; says Bryan McLaughlin, a professor of advertising at Texas Tech University and one of the study&#x2019;s co-authors, in a story with</span> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2022/08/220824102936.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Science Daily</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#x201C;This is why a healthy relationship with news consumption is an ideal situation.&#x201D;</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This study raises as many questions as it answers&#x2014;importantly, it doesn&#x2019;t look into whether changing one&#x2019;s news consumption habits has a measurable effect on that individual&#x2019;s mental health.
