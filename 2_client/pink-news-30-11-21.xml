<h2>Rihanna is declared a national hero in Barbados</h2>
<p>The singer was recently declared a national hero by Barbadian prime minister Mia Mottley as the country became a republic.</p>
<p>She was <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/30/rihanna-barbados-national-hero/">awarded the national honour</a> from her homeland in a televised ceremony swearing-in of the country’s first president.</p>
<p>The historic ceremony broke Barbados’ ties with the British monarchy – the country was first colonised by English settlers in the 1600s – and swore in president Sandra Mason, ending the Queen’s role as head of state.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, the prime minister quoted the singer’s own lyrics, telling Rihanna: “May you continue to shine like a diamond and bring honour to your nation by your words, by your actions and to do credit wherever you shall go.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The shows will take place ahead of her <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/26/adele-tickets-hyde-park-london-presale-prices/">hometown shows</a> at London’s Hyde Park next summer.</p>
<p>The singer is headlining two nights on 1-2 July, with tickets selling out in minutes earlier this year.</p>
<p>You can find out how to sign up for presale access, show dates and more for her Las Vegas residency below.</p>
<h2>What is Ticketmaster Verified Fan Presale?</h2>
<p>To get the chance to buy Adele presale tickets, fans can sign up to Ticketmaster Verified Fan for free.</p>
<p>Just head to <a href="https://verifiedfan.ticketmaster.com/adele">verifiedfan.ticketmaster.com/adele</a> and sign in with your Ticketmaster account or create one if you don’t already have one.</p>
<p>You can then register for presale access until 11:59pm PST (7:59am UK time) on 2 December. You’ll receive a confirmation email and a unique code for the chance to purchase tickets.</p>
<p>The Verified Fan Presale will then begin on 7 December at 10am PST (6pm UK time).</p>
<p>Ticketmaster say it “makes ticket buying safe and fair for all fans. By keeping bots and other suspicious activity out of the ticket buying process, more fans who want to attend the show will have the opportunity to find and buy tickets.</p>
<p>“While it does not guarantee that everyone will get a ticket, it does level the playing field so a fan is only up against another fan – without racing against bots – for the same ticket.”</p>
<h2>When is the general sale for Adele tickets?</h2>
<p>Following Ticketmaster’s Verified Fan Presale, the tickets will be released in a general sale on 7 December at 10am.</p>
<p>These tickets will also be available from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=1643X538054&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ticketmaster.com%2Fadele-tickets%2Fartist%2F1159272%2F">ticketmaster.com/adele-tickets</a>.</p>
<p>Demand is expected to be high on this date, so try and be flexible with your preferred show for a better chance at securing tickets.</p>
<h2>How much are tickets?</h2>
<p>According to an Adele fan page, “ticket prices for Adele’s residency #WeekendsWithAdele may fluctuate, based on demand, at any time.”</p>
<p>This has been the case for previous Las Vegas residencies including Lady Gaga’s.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>On Tuesday (30 November), Hungary’s parliament gave the green light to prime minister Viktor Orbán’s horrific national referendum on “LGBT+ propaganda”.</h3>
<p>Orbán <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/21/hungary-referendum-lgbt-trans-eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed the referendum</a> in July, in response to criticism of the country’s “<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/06/15/hungary-anti-lgbt-homophobia-propaganda-law-ban-fidesz-viktor-orban-section-28/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-schema-attribute="">LGBT+ propaganda</a>” ban, doubling down on his crusade against the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/queer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">queer</a> community in Hungary.</p>
<p>The prime minister has now received parliament’s approval, and the referendum can go ahead.</p>
<p>Parliament voted on each question individually, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/hungary-parliament-clears-way-governments-lgbt-referendum-election-nears-2021-11-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a>, and they were easily approved with the ruling majority of Orbán’s Fidesz party.</p>
<p>Balazs Orbán, deputy minister and no relation to the prime minister, told parliament: “The Hungarian government proposes that citizens should have a chance to express their stance on the issues of gender propaganda.</p>
<p>“We are committed. We believe that we… have to say no to LGBTQ propaganda in schools carried out with the help of NGOs and media, without parental consent.”</p>
<p>It is not clear when the referendum will take place, but the deputy minister suggested holding it on the same day as the parliamentary election next spring to save money.</p>
<h2>Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán plans to include damaging, anti-LGBT+ questions in the referendum</h2>
<p>When he announced his planned referendum earlier this year, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/26/viktor-orban-maria-walsh-hungary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viktor Orbán</a> also outlined some of the questions he would include, clearly chosen to deepen anti-<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/lgbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LGBT</a>+ hatred in Hungary.</p>
<p>He said he would ask Hungarians whether they support “sexual orientation workshops” in schools without parental consent, and whether content that could “affect” the sexual orientation of children should be shown without restrictions.</p>
<p>Orbán also said he planned to ask the nation whether they believe gender affirming surgeries should be performed on children.</p>
<p>“Our children’s future is at stake and we cannot make concessions in this case,” Orban said at the time, insisting that “when pressure on our country is this strong, Hungary could only be protected by the common will of the people.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Trans <em>Jeopardy!</em> champ Amy Schneider has been praised for both her skill and for increasing LGBT+ visibility after winning her ninth game in a row – with one fan suggesting she could one day host the show.</h3>
<p>She appeared on <em>Jeopardy!</em> for the first time on November 17, and her <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/29/trans-jeopardy-amy-schneider/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressive winning streak</a> has secured her place in the show’s Tournament of Champions, making her the first ever <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/topic/transgender/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trans</a> contestant to qualify. Her wins have earned her more than $300,000 to date.</p>
<p>Schneider is a life-long J<em>eopardy!</em> fan and had dreamed of appearing on the game show for years.</p>
<p>“I did the interview three times, and the third one finally worked,” she told <a href="https://abc7news.com/jeopardy-champion-amy-transgender-winner-today-schneider-on/11283265/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ABC7</em></a>.</p>
<p>While competing is a dream come true for Schneider, she also wants to use her platform to advocate for trans rights and increase LGBT+ visibility.</p>
<p>“Seeing trans people anywhere in society that you haven’t seen them before is so valuable,” she said.</p>
<p>“Kids right now, they’re seeing it… I am so grateful that I am giving some nerdy little trans kid somewhere the realisation that this is something that they could do too.”</p>
<h2>Amy Schneider has been hailed as a ‘trans icon’</h2>
<p>Since she began wiping the floor with every <em>Jeopardy!</em> contestant she came up against, Amy Schneider has earned a loyal following, and has become a verified “trans icon” who appears to be “absolutely unbeatable”.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>On the first day of Jussie Smollett’s trial for allegedly staging a hate crime against himself, his lawyer told the court he “is a real victim” of a “real crime”.</h3>
<p>On Monday (29 November), Smollett’s trial began at the Leighton Criminal Court in Chicago, Illinois. He is accused of <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/02/12/jussie-smollett-empire-indictment-staged-homophobic-racist-attack-hoax-chicago-illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six felony disorderly conduct charges</a> over the alleged hoax, which could carry a prison sentence of three years, but the former <em>Empire</em> actor is sticking with his story.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/nov/29/jussie-smollett-trial-racist-attack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Independent</em></a>, His defence attorney Nenye Uche told the court in his opening statement that there was not a “shred” of evidence against the actor, and declared: “Jussie Smollett is a real victim.”</p>
<p>Smollett claims that he was attacked in January 2019 by two white Donald Trump supporters in ski masks, who used homophobic and racist slurs, poured bleach on him, and looped a noose around his neck.</p>
<p>Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, brothers who had worked on <em>Empire</em> as extras and who are both Black, were later arrested after they were seen on surveillance footage purchasing a ski masks, gloves and a red hat ahead of the alleged attack.</p>
<p>But the brothers later claimed that Smollett paid them $3,500 to stage the attack.</p>
<p>In court, Smollett’s defence said that he had paid the brothers the money, but that it had been for personal training services while he prepared for a music video. Uche painted the brothers as unreliable and insisted it didn’t add up that Smollett would pay by cheque for the allegedly staged attack.</p>
<p>He said: “At the end of the day they want you to believe Jussie was stupid enough to pay for a hoax with a cheque but was smart enough to pay [for supplies] with a $100 bill.”</p>
<p>Uche also said that in the hundreds of pages of police reports was a witness statement from a local resident, who said they had seen a white man with “reddish brown hair” in the area that night, and “could see hanging out from underneath his jacket what appeared to be a rope”.</p>
<h2>The prosecution accused Jussie Smollett of ‘devising a fake hate crime’</h2>
<p>Special prosecutor Dan Webb, who was instated after initial charges against Smollett in 2019, told the court: “When he reported the fake hate crime that was a real crime.”</p>
<p>Webb said that Smollett had “devised this fake crime” because he was unsatisfied with his studio’s response to a threatening letter he had received around a week before.</p>
<p>Smollett received the “poison pen” style letter at the studio where <em>Empire</em> was filming, and it included a death threat and a drawing of a man hanging from a tree. The return address was listed simply as “MAGA”.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Webb told the court that police had not determined who wrote the letter.</p>
<p>The special prosecutor accused Smollett of holding a “dress rehearsal” of the attack with brothers Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, and said he gave them cash to buy supplies.</p>
<p>He added that surveillance footage showed the actor walking back to his apartment with a clothes line around his neck after the “attack”, still holding a sandwich he bought earlier.</p>
<p>The trial is expected to last one week, although it is not clear if Smollett will testify. On Tuesday (30 November), a Chicago Police Department officer will take the stand.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Footballers, rugby players, jockeys and more have united for LGBT+ inclusion in sport for Stonewall’s annual Rainbow Laces campaign.</h3>
<p>Over the weekend, players up and down the country donned rainbow laces and armbands to highlight LGBT+ inclusion.</p>
<p>Liverpool men’s manager Jurgen Klopp and women’s player Meikayla Moore discussed the Rainbow Laces campaign in a video for the teams’ LFC TV.</p>
<p>Moore said that as an “out and proud” footballer, she wanted to encourage others to speak out if they need help</p>
<p>“In women’s football, I’ve been very fortunate that being LGBTQ+ is not as unusual as in the men’s game. It’s very accepted and the community is very strong,” she said.</p>

<p>Klopp called himself a “perfect example” of how Rainbow Laces encourage awareness of LGBT+ rights in sports.</p>
<p>“I’m 54, I’ve been through a lot of periods in my life but a lot of problems I’ve never had,” he said.</p>
<p>He continued:”I have so many gay friends but I never thought about how it was when they had to say, ‘by the way, mum, dad’ – and to everyone else – ‘I’m not exactly how you expected, maybe’.</p>
<p>“That’s a challenge we shouldn’t face, in the way we face it in our life.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the Rainbow Laces campaign launched in 2013, it has been adopted by sports from women’s basketball to wheelchair rugby, encouraging sports teams to show their support for LGBT+ equality, and to make sports more inclusive. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stonewall’s campaign began on Thursday (25 November) and will run until 12 December, this year with a Lace Up and Speak Up theme, encouraging athletes to support LGBT+ issues. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stonewall said in a statement: “Our iconic rainbow laces have become a symbol of inclusion across sport and fitness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Over a million of you have already worn the laces in support of LGBT+ inclusion.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The England Rugby team has also come out in support of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> campaign. </span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Michael Urie has explained why he was so adamant that gay actors be cast as gay characters in Netflix’s new queer Christmas film <em>Single All The Way</em>.</h3>
<p>The actor, who rose to fame playing Marc on <em>Ugly Betty</em>, plays <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/11/10/jennifer-coolidge-single-all-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a perpetually single gay man</a> called Peter in <i>Single All The Way</i>. Peter lives in Los Angeles with his best friend Nick (Philemon Chambers) – and romance quickly blossoms when the pair return to Peter’s family home for the Christmas season.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCQxxqdowOg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three major gay characters</a> in <i>Single All The Way </i>– Peter, Nick and James, who is played by Luke Macfarlane. All three roles are played by openly gay actors.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any real power, but I was very clear that we need to make sure the other guys are really gay,” Michael told <em>PinkNews</em>.</p>
<p>“I was like, it’s gonna be a lot easier in a year when I’m on Zoom doing junkets if we can speak authentically about our gay experience. It’s going to be a lot easier than tiptoeing around the fact that my co-star, who I spend the entire movie falling in love with, doesn’t know what it’s like to be in love with a man.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Single All The Way | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kCQxxqdowOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>“Those are conversations we had early when looking for the roles – and everybody was on the same page, by the way. But I was very clear – I wanted to make sure everyone knew how much harder my job would be if I was doing interviews with a straight person talking about gay love.”</p>
<h2><em>Single All The Way </em>star Michael Urie is tired of seeing straight actors playing gay roles</h2>
<p>Michael points out that <em>Single All The Way </em>is a film about two gay men falling in love with each other – it made sense that those roles should be played by gay actors.</p>
<p>“If I’m talking about that with some straight guy, and then the narrative is all like, ‘You were <em>so </em>convincing!’ – like, come on, give me a break. We’ve done that, we’re tired of that, we don’t need that anymore.</p>
<p>“And maybe the pendulum will swing back. Maybe I’ll be doing a junket where everyone’s talking about how believable I was playing the heterosexual love interest in a holiday rom-com, wouldn’t that be interesting? And maybe that will happen, but for now, we all needed to be pioneering what we do. So it was important to me that in this movie, we represent ourselves.”</p>
<p>Philemon Chambers, who plays Peter’s best friend Nick in <i>Single All The Way</i>, agrees. He thinks the film wouldn’t have been as impactful if the gay characters were played by straight actors.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“My character Nick, he’s just himself – and it made me just be myself,” Philemon told <em>PinkNews</em>.</p>
<p>“Who I am is who I am. It would not have been the movie it is now if we had straight actors playing gay characters. They would have never known our experience – not at all.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Caitlyn Jenner <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/06/01/meet-caitlyn-jenner-former-olympian-reveals-new-name-on-vanity-fair-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out</a> as trans in 2015 and has, for the last six years, enjoyed the unenviable position of being both the most famous trans woman in the world and one of the least liked by the rest of the LGBT+ community.</h3>
<p>As many others have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/caitlyn-jenner-california-policies-views-b1843106.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a>, it’s unsurprising that Jenner, 71, is broadly disliked: she’s a rich, Trump-supporting Republican whose daily life is a far cry from the realities faced by other trans and non-binary people. Plus, she plays golf.</p>
<p>And unlike other famous trans celebrities, such as <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/04/17/elliot-page-anti-trans-bills-us-sports-ban-healthcare-puberty-blockers-instagram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elliot Page</a> and <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/07/29/laverne-cox-dababy-hiv-homophobia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laverne Cox</a>, Jenner has not used her huge platform to advocate for trans and non-binary people who are less privileged than her. Instead, she’s done the opposite: Railing against trans girls playing school sports, upset lesbian hero and vocal trans ally Megan Rapinoe, and defended Dave “transphobic jokes” Chappelle.</p>
<p>Her fame and wealth mean she could be a useful ally in the struggle against transphobic violence and discrimination, but because of her terrible politics she’s instead chosen, several times, to throw her trans siblings under the bus.</p>
<p>When it comes to representation, we know that one person can never represent “the trans community” – there are as many different experiences of being trans as there are trans people. We also know that visibility politics, promoted through awareness-raising calendar events like Trans Awareness Week and Trans Day of Visibility, often achieve little in terms of improving trans people’s lives. The concepts of visibility and awareness are often criticised for failing to tackle the barriers to housing, healthcare, employment and safety that so many trans people suffer, and representation is the third prong of that useless trio.</p>
<p>Trans celebrities, just like other celebrities, are sometimes looked to as the leaders of a movement. But in the case of Caitlyn Jenner, it’s been made crystal clear that the only interests she’s promoting are her own. Here are six of the times that the most famous trans woman in the world showed us that representation truly isn’t everything.</p>
<h2>1. The time Caitlyn Jenner said ‘it isn’t fair’ for trans girls to play sports at school</h2>
<p>In May 2021, former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner said that trans inclusion in sport is “<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/05/02/caitlyn-jenner-trans-girls-womens-sports-republican-ban/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a question of fairness</a>” and added: “That’s why I oppose biological boys who are trans competing in girls’ sports in school. It just isn’t fair and we have to protect girls’ sports in our schools.”</p>
<p>But the internet’s memory is long: In 2016, Jenner had <a href="https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2016/03/30/caitlyn-jenner-dazzles-in-first-golf-tournament-as-a-woman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">competed in a women’s golf tournament</a> at a fancy country club in California.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I didn’t expect to get asked this on my Saturday morning coffee run, but I’m clear about where I stand. It’s an issue of fairness and we need to protect girls’ sports in our schools.<a href="https://t.co/YODLDQ3csP">https://t.co/YODLDQ3csP</a></p>
<p>— Caitlyn Jenner (@Caitlyn_Jenner) <a href="https://twitter.com/Caitlyn_Jenner/status/1388585005199228928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2021</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>2. Backing Texas’ internationally reviled abortion ban</h2>
<p>Ahead of the California gubernatorial recall election on 14 September, Caitlyn Jenner continued her campaign strategy of <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/06/24/caitlyn-jenner-critical-race-theory-racism-trans-sports-california-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying the worst things possible</a>.</p>
<p>Addressing the new law in Texas that makes it illegal for people to terminate pregnancies beyond six weeks, which is well before many even know they are pregnant, Jenner <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/09/08/caitlyn-jenner-texas-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that although she supports “a woman’s right to choose” she also “supports Texas in that decision”.</p>
<h2>3. Defending Dave Chappelle, a poor victim of ‘woke cancel culture’</h2>
<p>Dave Chappelle’s Netflix special <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/07/dave-chapelle-netflix-the-closer-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Closer</em></a> has been widely condemned for homophobic and transphobic jokes, with LGBT+ activists supporting trans Netflix employees in organising a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/21/netflix-trans-chappelle-protest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company-wide walkout</a> in protest at how the streaming giant handled the whole sorry situation.</p>
<p>Jenner, meanwhile, was busy defending Chappelle by reposting a clip of the comedy show on Twitter and adding that Chappelle is “100 per cent right”. She went on to explain that for her, the controversy isn’t about the “LGBTQ movement” but really about “woke cancel culture run amok, trying to silence free speech”.</p>
<p>“We must never yield or bow to those who wish to stop us from speaking our minds,” Jenner said.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h2>4. Saying she’ll fight against the teaching of critical race theory</h2>
<p>Critical race theory is essentially an academic framework that considers how racism is embedded within legal systems, policies and society rather than just being an issue of individual prejudice. But in June, when Caitlyn Jenner was <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/06/24/caitlyn-jenner-critical-race-theory-racism-trans-sports-california-governor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked for her thoughts on critical race theory</a>, she declared: “I will do everything to fight critical race theory being taught to our children.”</p>
<p>She added, somewhat confusingly: “This generation coming up is probably the least racist generation, the most open-minded generation in the history of our country, we don’t need to set them back and try to teach them racism.</p>
<p>“So I am totally 100 per cent against [critical race theory].”</p>
<h2>5. Caitlyn Jenner upsetting Megan Rapinoe</h2>
<p>Megan Rapinoe, the lesbian darling of US soccer and an outspoken trans ally, was unimpressed by Caitlyn Jenner’s statements about it not being “fair” for trans girls to play sports at school.</p>
<p>“You were an exceptional athlete. You’re not an exceptional politician,” Rapinoe said of Jenner on an episode of the Fubo Sports Network show <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9ZldAZJOrI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Cooligans.</a></em></p>
<h2>6. Complaining about people who are homeless</h2>
<p>When she announced her (dramatically unsuccessful) bid to become the governor of California from her private aeroplane hangar, Caitlyn Jenner had already set some people’s hackles on edge. But in an interview with <em>Fox News </em>to promote her political campaign, Jenner managed to go even further – by complaining about homeless people.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“My friends are leaving California,” Jenner said. “My hangar, the guy right across, he was packing up his hangar and I said: ‘Where are you going?’</p>
<p>“And he says: ‘I’m moving to Sedona, Arizona, I can’t take it anymore. I can’t walk down the streets and see the homeless’.” Her comments quickly became a lightning rod for criticism on Twitter, with countless users incensed at how “<a href="https://twitter.com/chuerta1/status/1390178241927794692" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out of touch”</a> the plane-owning millionaire is.</p>
<p>One in five trans people in the US will be homeless at least once in their lifetime, <a href="https://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to</a> the National Center for Transgender Equality.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The historic ceremony broke Barbados’ ties with the British monarchy – the country was first colonised by English settlers in the 1600s – and swore in president Sandra Mason, ending the Queen’s role as head of state. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mottley announced during the ceremony that Rihanna, also known by her full name Robyn Rihanna Fenty, would be made a member of the Order of National Heroes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prime minister quoted the singer’s own lyrics at the ceremony, telling Rihanna: “May you continue to shine like a diamond and bring honour to your nation by your words, by your actions and to do credit wherever you shall go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rihanna appeared moved by the honour, touching her heart and laughing behind her face mask when she was brought to the stage to accept the order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The singer was previously named </span><a href="https://gisbarbados.gov.bb/blog/rihanna-ambassador-extraordinary-and-plenipotentiary/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ambassador to Barbados</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in 2018.</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>After a painfully long wait, <em>Euphoria</em> season two has a confirmed release date and a thrilling first trailer. Here’s everything we know about the new episodes.</h3>
<p>Euphoria won plaudits and awards (including a Best Actress Emmy for its lead, Zendaya) following its first run back in 2019.</p>
<p>The series follows a group teenagers who struggle with difficult issues, including toxic relationships, drug addiction and mental illness.</p>
<p>At its core are Rue (Zendaya) and Jules (<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/01/10/hunter-schafer-trans-euphoria-zendaya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hunter Schafer</a>), who grapple with an on-off relationship while Rue tries to overcome drug addiction and Jules, who is trans, settles into town as a newcomer.</p>
<p>The first season ended with plenty of unanswered questions, with a pair of special “bridge episodes” which aired last year providing few answers. Here’s everything we know so far about <em>Euphoria</em> season two.</p>
<h2><em>Euphoria</em> season two trailer teases trouble for Rue</h2>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="EUPHORIA | SEASON 2 | OFFICIAL TEASE | HBO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RPz_XktsEFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>On 23 November, HBO dropped the first trailer for the new episodes. It begins in Rue’s bedroom, where she is dancing and singing along to Frank Sinatra’s “Call Me Irresponsible”.</p>
<p>A quick montage of scenes follows, depicting parties, violence and chaos. Rue appears to be struggling with addiction once again, and is seen running from a police car.</p>
<h2><strong>What happened in the ‘bridge’ episodes?</strong></h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced many TV shows to shut down production, and <em>Euphoria </em>was no exception. <a href="https://collider.com/euphoria-special-episode-2-interview-hunter-schafer/">According to Hunter Schafer</a>, season two was forced to halt only three days before the start of production.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to film the new season amid lockdown, the producers of <em>Euphoria</em> opted to create two special episodes focusing on Rue and Jules’ relationships and the characters’ state of mind.</p>
<p>The first episode, titled “Trouble Don’t Last Always”, followed Rue as she reflected on her recent relapse while spending Christmas Eve with Ali, her Narcotics Anonymous mentor, who shared his own experiences with drug addiction and how it disrupted his relationship with his family.</p>
<p>The second episode, titled “F*** Anyone Who’s Not a Sea Blob”, centred on Jules’ first therapy session after she abandoned Rue at the end of the first season.</p>
<p>Jules opened up about the pressure of dating somebody with a drug addiction, and explored how her mother’s own addiction impacted her growing up.</p>
<p>At the end of the second special episode, Rue paid a surprise visit to Jules. Jules attempted to apologise for skipping town, but Rue departed abruptly and Jules was left crying alone in her room, leaving fans on another cliffhanger.</p>
<h2><strong>Will Rue and Jules get back together?</strong></h2>
<p>Back in June 2021, Zendaya posted a short but cryptic teaser video on her Instagram, featuring Rue and Jules smiling at each other from across the school corridor, suggesting a possible reunion.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://collider.com/euphoria-special-episode-2-interview-hunter-schafer/">interview with <em>Collider</em></a>, Hunter Schafer said that season one left her with countless questions about what will be next for Jules and her relationship with Rue.</p>
<p>“I wanted to know, how long Jules was planning on running away for? Is she severing ties with everyone and just running free? Is this all gonna collapse in on itself and she’s gonna come back? Is she OK? I definitely had a multitude of questions and wondered what that meant for Rue and Jules. Can their relationship, whatever it is, withstand something more dramatic and intense like that? Also, how will Rue’s relapse affect them?”</p>
<p>Schafer hopes Jules and Rue will be able to “find a happy frequency together” despite the tragedy and turbulence that has so far defined their relationship.</p>
<p>Schafer also expressed her joy at being able to portray a nuanced trans character: “As a queer trans person, I’m really excited to be exploring queerness as a trans person with Jules, as well,” she told <em>Collider</em>.</p>
<h2>Euphoria season two will be ‘tough’ and ‘grown-up’</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://www.etonline.com/zendaya-on-being-so-close-with-tom-holland-and-her-spider-man-3-co-stars-exclusive-168629">an interview with <em>ET Online</em></a>, Zendaya said “it’s a tough season”, especially for her character, Rue. “It’s brutal, but a character like that I think really deserves that time and deserves those moments. I’m in the middle of it right now. Like, I had a night shoot ’til 2:30 last night,” she told the outlet.</p>
<p>Sydney Sweeney, who plays Cassie on the show and recently starred in <em>The White Lotus</em>, has also commented on the new season while remaining tight-lipped.</p>
<p>“It’s darker; it’s more intense,” she told <em><a href="https://www.etonline.com/sydney-sweeney-talks-white-lotus-finale-and-euphoria-season-2-170616" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ET Online</a>.</em> “I don’t want to say much more without giving too much away.”</p>
<p>She added: “I am so beyond excited and proud of the season, so I cannot wait for everyone to see it and all the hard work everyone’s been putting into it.”</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Doniella Davy, the make-up artist responsible for <em>Euphoria’s</em> eye-catching looks, has revealed that the second season will have a “more grown-up” atmosphere. “A lot of time has gone by. Everyone’s grown up a bit. We’re picking up in the same place, but the world has shifted a little bit. The <em>Euphoria </em>world, just as our world has as well,” she told <em>CNN</em>.</p>
<h2>Tackling important social issues</h2>
<p>Colman Domingo, who plays Ali, Rue’s sponsor from Narcotics Anonymous, shared his own theories on future seasons in <a href="https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a34881565/euphoria-season-2-colman-domingo/">an interview with <em>Digital Spy</em></a>.</p>
<p>Domingo suggested that <em>Euphoria</em> could explore the Black Lives Matter movement and the COVID-19 pandemic, as he believes showrunner Sam Levison is keen to explore important social issues. “Sam is very astute and interested in the world, and letting the show hold a mirror up to society, and deconstruct it, and smash it over the head with a hammer,” said Domingo.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>This week, the US Supreme Court will hear Mississippi’s case for overturning the <em>Roe v Wade</em> decision that federally guaranteed the right to an abortion.</h3>
<p>Mississippi is asking the Supreme Court to uphold the state’s ban on most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy by overturning<em> Roe v Wade,</em> potentially devastating reproductive rights across the US.</p>
<p>It is also looking for the courts to overrule the <em>Planned Parenthood v Casey</em> decision, in 1992, which prevents states from banning termination before the point of viability (a foetus is only viable outside of the womb when a pregnancy has reached around 24 weeks).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has never ruled in favour of an abortion ban before viability.</p>
<p>Although it heard arguments relating to <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/09/21/jonathan-mitchell-texas-abortion-lgbt-rights-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Texas SB 8 ban on abortion after six weeks</a>, before most people are aware they are pregnant, it did not rule on the constitutionality of the ban. Instead, it declined to intervene while a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2021/10/09/texas-abortion-ban-take-effect-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">court challenge</a> goes ahead.</p>
<p>But advocates for reproductive rights are nervous.</p>
<p>The Mississippi case marks the most serious challenge to <em>Roe v Wade</em> in decades, and the court hearing the arguments, beginning on 1 December, has a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/10/27/amy-coney-barrett-supreme-court-confirmed-sworn-in-senate-vote-lgbt-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6-3 conservative majority thanks to Donald Trump. </a></p>
<p>Shannon Brewer, Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only abortion clinic in the whole of Mississippi, told <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/mississippi-state-texas-abortion-law-clinic-planned-parenthood/11277484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ABC</em></a>: “This is the most worried I’ve ever been.”</p>
<h2>Supreme Court abortion case could ‘diminish’ the 14th amendment</h2>
<p>The granting of abortion rights across America relied on the Supreme Court’s interpretation of the fifth and 14th amendments of the US constitution.</p>
<p>Both amendments guarantee that no one shall be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law”. According to the court’s interpretation, the right to privacy falls under “liberty”, and therefore so does the right to an abortion.</p>
<p>But other rights relating to bodily autonomy, including contraception and same-sex marriage, also rest on this interpretation, and are classed as “due process rights”.</p>
<p>Marshall Martinez, executive director of Equality New Mexico, told the non-profit news organisation <i><a href="https://nmpoliticalreport.com/2021/11/29/how-the-supreme-courts-ruling-on-abortion-rights-this-term-could-affect-lgbtq-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Mexico Political Report</a>: </i>“There is a real possibility that if this court said <em>Roe</em> was wrongly decided, it never gave us the right to privacy, then there could be other challenges.”</p>
<p>Lawyer Laura Schauer added: “Generally, any diminishment of the 14th amendment could have a ripple effect but it depends on how they do it.”</p>
<p>The potential “diminishment of the 14th amendment”, which would result in a diminishment of the right to privacy and bodily autonomy, could topple a multitude of LGBT+ rights, from marriage equality, to gender-affirming healthcare, to sex itself.</p>
<p>For example, in the 2001 case <em>Lawrence v Texas, </em>the Supreme Court ruled that state sodomy bans were unconstitutional, and based this decision on the 14th amendment.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>But Justice Clarence Thomas, who still sits on the Supreme Court today and is currently in the company of five other conservative justices, dissented at the time.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/539/558/case.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>: “I can find, neither in the Bill of Rights nor any other part of the Constitution, a general right of privacy.”</p>
<p>Technically, the Supreme Court could uphold Mississippi’s abortion ban without overturning <em>Roe v Wade, </em>but the outcome would be similar and would still undermine the long-held concept that the 14th amendment protects Americans’ right to privacy.</p>
<p>Julie Rikelman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who will argue against Mississippi, told <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/mississippi-state-texas-abortion-law-clinic-planned-parenthood/11277484/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>ABC</em></a>: “A decision upholding this ban is tantamount to overruling <em>Roe</em>.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The duo, who have been playing music together for a decade, performed two concerts in New York in August, the last of which was aired on CBS on Sunday (28 November).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final concerts come as Bennett, 95, announced that he has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in an <a href="https://www.aarp.org/entertainment/celebrities/info-2021/tony-bennett-alzheimers.html">interview with <em>AARP</em></a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The real ‘lady’ of the hour is Susan Benedetto, Tony’s remarkable wife,” Lady Gaga said on Instagram when the concert was aired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you Susan for how you love Tony Bennett. I love you and Tony and the whole family so much. I’ll cry about tonight forever.”</span></p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>With temperatures sitting comfortably in the late teens, Malta makes for a great autumn and winter destination for queer travellers.</h3>
<p>The small archipelago has been ranked number one on <a href="https://rainbow-europe.org/country-ranking#">the Rainbow Europe</a> list of LGBT-friendly destinations for five years running, and with its progressive social attitudes and legal rights, much of the island — and its activities — are inherently inclusive.</p>
<p>What’s more, Malta has some of Europe’s lowest COVID-19 rates, with new cases in the low double digits and <a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/malta/">more than 80 per cent</a> of the population fully vaccinated. There’s plenty to see and do on the island during the milder months including an exclusive Cirque du Soleil show, making it ideal for a festive getaway.</p>
<h2> Let Cirque du Soleil transport you to FIERI</h2>

<p>Malta’s historic capital, Valletta, will play host to the famed Canadian troupe from 25 November to 19 December. Returning to the Mediterranean for the first time since lockdown began, <a href="https://www.visitmalta.com/en/events-in-malta-and-gozo/event/fieri-by-cirque-du-soleil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cirque du Soleil will be running 28 exclusive 75-minute performances on the island.</a> While the new show will include all the signature acrobatics and visual artistry that Cirque du Soleil is known for, <a href="https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/fieri">FIERI has been created with Malta</a> specifically in mind and is inspired by the cultural roots of the archipelago. Cirque du Soleil has always stood with the LGBT+ community, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2016/04/15/cirque-du-soleil-cancels-north-carolina-gigs-over-hb2/comments/">cancelling a string of North Carolina</a> shows in 2016 to protest an anti-LGBT+ law.</p>

<p>Seafood is at the centrepoint of Maltese cuisine, with the archipelago having year-round access to an abundance of fresh fish. <a href="https://www.visitmalta.com/en/category/michelin-restaurants-malta/">Malta’s restaurants</a> have been widely acknowledged for their food — five have been awarded Michelin Stars, three have a Bib Gourmand award and 23 others have been accredited with a Michelin Plate Award. Head to 59 Republic in Valletta for Mediterranean and French notes, to the 500-year-old The Medina Restaurant in Mdina, or to Ta’ Frenc’ for a more intimate yet rustic setting, situated on the road between Victoria and Marsalforn.</p>

<p>Three-hundred days of sunlight kiss the Maltese land each year — paired with a light sea breeze that enriches the soil, this creates an ideal temperature and <a href="https://www.visitmalta.com/en/category/wine-in-malta/">environment for wine-making. </a>Locally-produced full-bodied red, refreshing white and unique rosé are all available. Many local wineries and vineyards are open to visitors in what is the world’s smallest winemaking country: Emmanuel Delicata Wineries, for example, has an impressive portfolio of over 90 wine awards — visitors can visit the 17th century cellars and join a weekly wine-tasting tour run by in-house experts.</p>

<p>For history fans, <a href="https://theknightsofmalta.com/">Knights of Malta</a> is a captivating experience based in the silent City of Mdina that tells the tale of those who ruled the Maltese islands for centuries. With a backdrop of the Casa Magazzini, which was built by the knights, visitors can witness the 3D audio-visual show: a realistic series of 34 tableaux hidden deep inside the bastion walls. Various buildings and monuments created by the knights remain scattered across the archipelago, while the fortified city of Mdina, which was once the capital, holds other impressive historical sites, like St Paul’s Catacombs and the Roman ruins of Domvs Romana.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of places to experience Maltese culture, both traditional and modern. On the island of Gozo, there’s Ta’ Dbiegi, the oldest crafts village, with some of the finest handmade items available to purchase on the island. The former capital, Mdina, meanwhile, is the hub of old culture and history. In the modern capital, Valletta, visitors can head to MUŻA, the national museum of art and heritage. For LGBT+ families interested in more modern culture, it’s worth visiting <a href="https://www.visitmalta.com/en/events-in-malta-and-gozo/event/fairyland-santas-city/">Fairyland Santa’s City</a> in Valletta this time of year — an adaptation of Santa’s story, complete with a grotto, ice rink and mulled wine.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A bisexual teacher has resigned after being told to remove his Pride flag by a school board in Michigan, US.</h3>
<p>On November 22, an email instructing teachers to remove any Pride flags from their classrooms was sent to multiple staff across a school district in Three Rivers, Michigan.</p>
<p>The email ordered teachers to take down their Pride flags at the beginning of the day, before students arrived, and not to reinstall them until further notice.</p>
<p>The decision was reportedly prompted by an “external challenge” which had “reached the board level”,<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/michigan-teachers-told-take-pride-flags-external-challenge-rcna6630"><em> NBC News</em> reported.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/life/bisexual-teacher-resigns-after-school-board-enforces-pride-flag-removals/">Shortly after receiving the email, bisexual teacher Russell Ball resigned from his position</a> as physical education teacher at Three Rivers Middle School.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">I resigned today after 12 years in education when the district demanded I remove my pride flag from my classroom. I refuse to be an active part of the oppression and suppression of an already marginalized student population.

<p>— Russell Ball (@coach_lardie) <a href="https://twitter.com/coach_lardie/status/1462817667342077959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2021</a></p></blockquote>

<p>He <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@russellballer/video/7033458091912121606?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lgbtqnation.com%2F&referer_video_id=7033458091912121606&refer=embed">took to TikTok</a> to explain that after being instructed to remove the flag, he refused to comply.</p>
<p>“I was not going to be an active participant in the suppression and oppression of an already marginalised group that I’m part of,” Ball said, explaining that he was already suffering from burnout at the time.</p>
<p>“The Pride flag stands for love, inclusion and equality… By removing it, I feel like I am being told that I am invalidated, that I don’t belong, and that’s not a message I want to send to myself or any of my students.”</p>
<p>He emphasised that it is important to him for his students to feel that they matter and belong, regardless of their sexual orientation.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Eight-time <em>Jeopardy!</em> winner Amy Schneider has explained her moving gesture of trans solidarity.</h3>
<p>Schneider made her <em>Jeopardy!</em> debut on November 17, in the middle of Transgender Awareness Week. Since then, she has won the game eight times, earning $295,200 (£222,000) from her stunning victories.</p>
<p>She’ll soon compete in the annual Tournament of Champions, which sees the 15 top contestants of the year go head-to-head. A contestant must clock five consecutive wins to qualify.</p>
<p>Schneider works as <a href="https://pridesource.com/article/amy-schneider-becomes-the-first-trans-person-to-qualify-for-the-jeopardy-tournament-of-champions/">an engineering manager and is based in Oakland, California</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview with <em>Newsweek</em>, Schneider revealed she had been trying to get on the gameshow for more than a decade. She was finally accepted by the show last year, but her appearance was delayed by the pandemic.</p>
<p>After her fifth win, Schneider penned <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/jeopardy-champion-transgender-woman-tournament-champions-1652910">an op-ed in the outlet</a> to mark her becoming the first trans person to qualify for the Tournament of Champions.</p>
<p>As well as elaborating on her strategy and admitting her surprise at her winning streak, Schneider wrote about the importance of transgender representation on TV.</p>
<p>“It was inspirational for me to see transgender contestants on the show before I became a contestant and I hope that I am now doing that same thing for all the other trans <em>Jeopardy!</em> fans out there,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“I hope I have given them the opportunity to see a trans person succeed. Until very recently trans people didn’t see themselves doing much out in the world, so to actually see something like this happen really opens your mind up to possibilities.”</p>

<p>For the Thanksgiving episode of <em>Jeopardy!, </em>which aired on 25 November, Schneider wore a Trans Pride flag pin.</p>
<p>Explaining her decision to wear it, she wrote on Twitter: <span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“Thanksgiving is a holiday that is all about family. And that can be hard for anybody who has been ostracised or otherwise cut off from their family, a group which, sadly, still includes a disproportionately high number of trans people, especially trans youth and trans people of colour. </span></p>
<p><span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">“So, it felt like a good time to show my membership in, and support of, a community that might be having a hard time right now.”</span></p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>The 25-year-old activist previously gained prominence when she was <a href="https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2021/11/chile-elects-first-transgender-official-national-legislature/">elected to represent over 42,000 students as the president of the University of Chile Student Federation</a>, where she led students to take part in Chile’s ‘Estallido Social’ (social outburst) protests between 2019 and 2021.</p>
<p>Schneider received over 26,000 votes in the nationwide election, and she will represent District 10 of Santiago de Chile. <a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2021/11/24/chile-s-first-transgender-deputy-elect-says-lgbt-community-afraid-of-kast">She will be sworn into the Chamber of Deputies in March 2022</a>, where she hopes to “expand rights in a stable and dialoguing manner”.</p>

<p>Despite her historic victory, Schneider admitted having mixed feelings as Chile prepares to elect a new president. She fears<a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2021/11/24/chile-s-first-transgender-deputy-elect-says-lgbt-community-afraid-of-kast"> a potential far-right victory </a>that could harm the LGBT+ community.</p>
<p>“The security, dignity and integrity of the rights of the LGBTI community and women are at stake,” she said, according to <a href="https://en.mercopress.com/2021/11/24/chile-s-first-transgender-deputy-elect-says-lgbt-community-afraid-of-kast"><em>Merco Press.</em></a></p>
<p>On 19 December, Chile will see a presidential run-off between far-right populist José Antonio Kast and left-wing candidate Gabriel Boric. Kast finished top after the first round of voting on 21 November, but no candidate won the required 50 per cent to win outright.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>However, she still believes there is a chance for positive change.</p>
<p>“The far-right seeks fear to prevail, but we have to make hope prevail, the same one that led us to vote for a new Constitution [in 2020] and the one that has prevailed in this last decade of mobilisations,” she added.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Botswana’s Court of Appeal has upheld a </span><a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/06/11/botswana-celebrates-historic-decriminalisation-gay-sex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2019 ruling that decriminalised gay sex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in a “huge win” for the LGBT community.</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In June 2019, the Botswana High Court struck down Section 164 of the country’s penal code, which outlawed sex between men.</span></p>
<p>Until then, gay sex was punishable by up to seven years in prison.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/07/06/botswana-appeal-against-ruling-decriminalising-gay-sex/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ruling was challenged in July of the same year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, when attorney general Abraham M. Keetshabe launched an appeal to re-establish the colonial-era law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The appeal was scrapped on Monday (29 November), and following the two-year legal battle, Botswana has now upheld that same-sex relations between men are legal.</span></p>
<p>Court of Appeal judge president Ian Kirby announced the decision, which was unanimous among the court’s five judges, and said sections of the penal code banning same-sex relations “have outlived their usefulness, and serve only to incentivise law enforcement agents to become key-hole peepers and intruders into the private space of citizens”.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ghanaian human rights group <a href="https://twitter.com/RightifyGhana">Rightify Ghana</a> called the decision a “huge win”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A huge win for the LGBTQ community in Botswana, as the country’s Court of Appeal has upheld a 2018 ruling, decriminalising consensual same-sex relationships,” the group said on Twitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Congratulations to the LGBTQ community, especially activists and those who led this good fight.”</span></p>

<p>Outside of the court, Sethunya Mosime, chair of the Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexuals of Botswana (LEGABIBO), told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/botswana-appeals-court-upholds-ruling-that-decriminalised-gay-sex-2021-11-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Reuters</em></a>: “This will forever change the landscape of democracy, human rights and equality in Botswana. Finally the state will have no business in what two consenting adults do in their privacy.”</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Same-sex couples in Botswana, however, still have no legal recognition, whether in the form of marriage or civil partnerships.</span></p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, following the ruling, Anna Mmolai-Chalmers, CEO of LEGABIBO, said: “It has taken a long time for our community to be where it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This incredibly life-changing decision, although it does not right all the wrongs done to individual members of the LGBT community, is a step towards restoring our dignity as human beings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The decision has several implications for the LGBTIQ community… Not only does it provide legal affirmation and recognition of the rights of LGBTIQ persons, but it allows an important space for addressing public health issues more efficiently and effectively. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We can finally start building a more tolerant society. The real work starts now.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Former <em>Empire</em> actor Jussie Smollett will face trial on Monday (29 November) for allegedly staging a racist, homophobic hate crime against himself in Chicago.</h3>
<p>The case, full of twists and turns, has fascinated the world, and could soon reach its conclusion nearly three years after it began.</p>
<p>Here is what you need to know before Smollett walks into court.</p>
<h2>Jussie Smollett is accused of sending himself a death threat ahead of the ‘attack’</h2>
<p>Before Jussie Smollett ever claimed he had been the victim of a racist, homophobic attack, the actor reported receiving a letter at the studio where <em>Empire</em> was filming.</p>
<p>Smollett told <em>Good Morning America</em> that the note, received on 22 January, 2019, “had a stick figure hanging from a tree with a gun pointing towards it with the words that said ‘Smollett, Jussie you will die’.”</p>
<p>The letter, written in “poison pen” style with letters cut out of magazines, had the return address listed simply as “MAGA”. It also contained a white powder, which was identified as Tylenol.</p>
<p>Police later said they believed that Smollett sent himself the letter.</p>
<h2>The <em>Empire</em> actor claims he was left with a rope around his neck</h2>
<p>Around a week later, in the early hours of 29 January, Jussie Smollett told police he was the victim of a violent homophobic, racist hate crime.</p>
<p>He said he was walking home from a Subway restaurant when he was approached by two men in ski masks, who shouted homophobic, racist slurs.</p>
<p>Smollett said his attackers, described as white, punched him in the face, poured a chemical substance on him and wrapped a rope around his neck. The actor, who had been outspoken in his criticism of the Trump administration, also claimed they told him: “This is MAGA country, [n-word].”</p>
<p>He said he believed the attack was linked to the threatening letter he’d received the week before.</p>
<h2>Jussie Smollett allegedly paid brothers thousands to stage hate crime</h2>
<p>Despite the actor’s claims about his “attack”, evidence soon surfaced that suggested it could have been orchestrated.</p>
<p>Surveillance video captured ahead of the incident showed two brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, who had worked on <em>Empire</em> as extras, purchasing a ski masks, gloves and a red hat.</p>
<p>They were arrested, but <a href="https://chicago.cbslocal.com/video/4030602-brothers-questioned-by-police-were-paid-3500-to-stage-jussie-smollett-attack-sources-say/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told investigators</a> that they had in fact been paid $3,500 by Smollett to stage the attack.</p>
<p>The brothers were released, with authorities citing “new evidence”. The Chicago Police Department <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2019/02/17/brothers-paid-stage-jussie-smollett-attack/2898804002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a statement in February, 2019: “We can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the <em>Empire</em> case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.”</p>
<p>On 20 February, 2019, Smollett was charged by a grand jury with a class four felony for filing a false police report, which carries a sentence of up to three years in prison.</p>
<p>Following Smollett’s arrest, a visibility angry superintendent Eddie T Johnson told a press conference: “Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career.</p>
<p>“I am left hanging my head asking: Why? Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How can an individual who’s been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in the city in the face with these false claims?”</p>
<p>Johnson insisted that Smollett had staged the attack because he was “dissatisfied with his salary” on <em>Empire</em>. The actor was later <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/04/24/empire-same-sex-wedding-jussie-smollett/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">written out of the show.</a></p>
<p>Smollett was <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/jussie-smollett-custody-chicago-police-allegedly-lying-attack/story?id=61208295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bailed out</a>, but by March had been indicted on 16 felony counts of “false report of offense”.</p>
<p>He consistently professed his innocence, promising that he had been “100 per cent factual and consistent on every level”.</p>
<p>Weeks later, charges against him were <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/03/26/charges-empire-actor-jussie-smollett-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a>.</p>
<h2>Prosecutors made an abrupt deal and dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett</h2>
<p>In late March, 2019, prosecutors in Chicago abruptly dropped all charges against Jussie Smollett, and agreed to an unusual deal.</p>
<p>In exchange for the dropped charges, Smollett was required to forfeit his $10,000 bail, and complete just 16 hours of community service.</p>
<p>Despite the arrangement, Smollett was not required to admit to having done anything wrong, and continued to insist that the attack took place as he initially described.</p>
<p>In August, 2019, a special prosecutor was assigned to investigate the dropping of the charges against Smollett.</p>
<p>In February, 2020, Smollett was indicted yet again with <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/02/12/jussie-smollett-empire-indictment-staged-homophobic-racist-attack-hoax-chicago-illinois/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">six felony charges</a> over the alleged hoax. He petitioned for the case to be dismissed, claiming the judge had overstepped his authority and misinterpreted the law, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/09/jussie-smollett-hate-crime-hoax-case-homophobia-racism-chicago-illinois-supreme-court/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but was rejected. </a></p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

        </section>
<h2>The actor and singer is now heading back to court</h2>
<p>Jussie Smollett, who has pleaded not guilty to all charges, will head back to court on Monday (29 November).</p>
<p>Despite his legal team’s attempts to have the case dismissed, his attorney Nenye Uche <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/jussie-smollett-s-criminal-case-will-move-forward-after-judge-n1281702" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has</a><span style="color: var(--bs-body-color); font-family: var(--bs-body-font-family); font-size: var(--bs-body-font-size); text-align: var(--bs-body-text-align); background-color: var(--bs-body-bg);"> said Smollett wants “nothing more than to go to a jury and clear his name”.</span></p>
<p>If found guilty, Smollett could face up to three years in prison and a $25,000 fine for each charge, and a judge would have to decide whether the sentences would run concurrently or consecutively.</p>
