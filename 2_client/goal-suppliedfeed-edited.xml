	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Timothy Weah essentially left Paris Saint-Germain because they were too successful. </p>

<p>The U.S. men's national team attacker spent five years at the Parc des Princes, rising through the capital club's academy right up to the first team.</p>

<p>However, once there, he understandably found minutes somewhat hard to come by at a club that features attacking megastars like Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel Di Maria.</p>

<p>And so, at the age of 19, Weah swapped the glitz and glamour of PSG for more modest goals at Lille. He took a step backwards in order to take his career forward, and now that bold move is belatedly paying off.</p>

<p>Indeed, as it turns out, Weah's hopes of lifting the Ligue 1 trophy didn't really end when he left Paris.</p>

<p>With just two games of the current campaign remaining, Lille are perfectly placed to deny PSG an eighth title in nine seasons.</p>

<p>Christophe Galtier's side are three points clear at the top of the table, meaning just four points from their final two games would be enough to seal the deal.</p>

<p>Lille face 11th-place Saint-Etienne at home this weekend before visiting 12th-place Angers on the final day. PSG, meanwhile, host 13th-place Reims in their penultimate match before wrapping up against 14th-place Brest.</p>

<p>In short, Lille's destiny is in their own hands. </p>

<p>It would be a stunning success for Les Dogues but also a personal triumph for Weah, a player  <a href="https://www.goal.com/story/nxgn2019en/index.html" target="_blank"> who ranked 17th on Goal's 2019 NxGn list </a>  but has been hindered by injuries over the past couple of years.</p>

<p>The American originally joined Lille ahead of the 2019-20 season, fresh off a loan spell with Celtic. He signed a five-year deal with the club who, at the time, were coming off a second-place finish, 16 points behind the club Weah had departed, PSG.</p>

<p><img alt="Ligue 1 table GFX" perform:prop="uuid:1uwd9ak1p82y1oeoy9rz2liim;width:1080;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/d4/35/ligue-1-table-gfx_e3o1i2kwkpio1jij152xkhafo.jpeg?t=1788061593" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>Injuries, though, defined his first season with the club. He missed six months after suffering a hamstring injury against Amiens before suffering another in his first game back against Marseille. In total, Weah made just three appearances during his debut season at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy.</p>

<p>This time around, though, Weah has carved out a more regular role for himself, mainly as an impact substitute. He's featured 28 times for Lille in Ligue 1 this season, with 21 of those appearances coming off the bench.</p>

<p>However, four of his seven starts have come since March, as Lille faced the most vital chunk of their season.</p>

<p>He's also contributed goals, too; three of them in Ligue 1 to be specific. Weah scored twice in a seven-day span in December as Lille took down Dijon and Montpellier before adding his third goal against Bordeaux in February.</p>

<p>You can also add in two goals from Lille's run through the Europa League, a competition that they won't return to next season as they set their sights on a Champions League run.</p>

<p>Weah's resurgence, though, is just one of several endearing success stories at Lille.</p>

<p>There's Jonathan David, Weah's fellow CONCACAF standout, who is Canada's best export not named Alphonso Davies, and Renato Sanches, the Portuguese star who has reignited his career after flopping at Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>Burak Yilmaz has contributed 17 goals after years of scoring freely in Turkey's Super Lig, while Premier League veteran Jose Fonte remains ever-present at the back.</p>

<p>"I think it's a great group of young guys who have a lot to prove," Weah said in February. "We're all super-hungry. </p>

<p>"I really want to speak about Renato [Sanches] too. He was having a tough time at Bayern, he wanted to start all over again, he came here and look at the success he's had so far! </p>

<p>"He's having a great time here. Everyone's having a great time and, as a group, we feel great. And everyone's just hungry to keep going."</p>

<p><img alt="Weah Neymar Buffon PSG" perform:prop="uuid:1xwanzsqcrhyc1exbsq9rym3yp;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/50/dd/weah-neymar-buffon-psg_wcg9yo02lors1k37vmybreyn2.png?t=1750584609" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>He added: "You know football. You never know what's going to happen but, with this group of players and this coaching staff, our goal was to be at the top and that's where we are at the moment. So, we're happy with that and we just want to continue doing what we're doing."</p>

<p>If they do, they'll claim what would be Lille's fourth Ligue 1 crown, and only their second since 1954. Weah would also get his hands on the trophy for the second time in his fledgling career, having made three appearances during PSG's 2017-18 title triumph.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, Weah has many fond memories of his time in Paris and he remains close to many members of the current squad.</p>

<p>"It was really surprising: I didn't expect Neymar to be such a good guy when I got to the team," Weah told the  <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/orange-slices/id1534795455"> Orange Slices podcast </a> . "I thought he would've had an ego and all that extra stuff, but he's a super-sincere guy, a good friend. I've seen him in New York a couple of times, so we hang out over there.</p>

<p>"Layvin Kurzawa is a good close friend on the team. I still see him when I go home to New York. We link up and just vibe. There are a bunch of good guys on that team."</p>

<p>However, the focus now is on denying his friends a fourth consecutive Ligue 1 title. </p>

<p>Weah and Lille's eclectic group of rising youngsters and formidable veterans have a golden opportunity to knock PSG off their carefully crafted perch.</p>

<p>The Paris Saint-Germain forward will not be available for the French cup final against Monaco after picking up a booking during the semi-final victory over Montpellier this week.</p>

<p>In a heated statement posted to his Instagram page, Neymar slammed French football's lawmakers for the suspension rules that will keep him out of competing for silverware at the end of the season.</p>

<h3>What did Neymar say?</h3>

<p>In an Instagram story, Neymar posted a message in Portuguese which translates as: "I would like to understand the reasoning of the guy who takes care of bookings in France! That deserves applause. What a mess."</p>

<p>It was accompanied by three facepalm emojis.</p>

<h3>Why has Neymar been suspended?</h3>

<p>Neymar picked up a booking despite only playing four minutes of the semi-final against Montpellier, having been introduced as an 86th-minute substitute by manager Mauricio Pochettino.</p>

<p>The Brazilian was sent on after Andy Delort's late equaliser for Montpellier made it 2-2, with the game eventually going to penalties. PSG triumphed 6-5 in the shoot-out to progress to the final.</p>

<p>In his short time on the field, Neymar managed to pick up a booking, which due to an accumulation of yellow and red cards ensures he will not be available for the final on May 19.</p>

<p>"I play five minutes, I commit a foul and he gives me a yellow without even thinking," wrote Neymar in reference to referee Jeremie Pignard in another Instagram story message. "Thank you for suspending me for the final. I think it was personal."</p>

<h3>What is the impact on PSG?</h3>

<p>Neymar's suspension means PSG will be without one of their star players for the final, as a side for so long the dominant force in French football face ending the season without a major trophy.</p>

<p>They have been knocked out of the Champions League, and are in a fight to retain their Ligue 1 crown, trailing leaders Lille by three points with two games remaining.</p>

<p>The main feature of the summer for Mikel Arteta’s side will be a three-team London tournament which will see them go head to head with Chelsea and Tottenham in early August.</p>

<p>The Gunners will also spend time in Scotland during the summer and are looking into the possibility of having a week away at a training camp in the United States.</p>

<h3>London tournament plans</h3>

<p>Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham will all compete in a tournament during the summer, with the majority of proceeds raised going to London charities.</p>

<p>Final details of the competition are still being worked out, with talks continuing over the size of crowd that could be allowed to watch the three games.</p>

<p>But <strong>Goal</strong> has been told that Arsenal will host Chelsea at Emirates Stadium and will play north London rivals Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The other match will see Chelsea take on Tottenham at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The tournament will run during the first week of August.</p>

<h3>What else are Arsenal planning at Emirates Stadium?</h3>

<p>As well as the Chelsea game, Arsenal are looking to play one other pre-season fixture at Emirates Stadium.</p>

<p>Although the Emirates Cup will not return in its usual two-day tournament guise this summer, talks are taking place with the club's sponsors over a match which will see high-profile opposition visit north London.</p>

<p>The game is expected to follow the London tournament and be Arsenal's final friendly ahead of the new season.</p>

<h3>Will Arsenal go abroad this summer?</h3>

<p>Arsenal are hoping to have one warm weather training camp overseas, although they have yet to finalise a destination.</p>

<p>The club are exploring the possibility of a week-long stay in the United States which would include some games, but it could be that they decide that a trip to Europe will be easier due to the current difficulties surrounding travel during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Arteta will take his players to Scotland in mid-July, however, for a training camp that will be centred around two pre-season games.</p>

<p>They will take on Rangers on Saturday, July 17 and will also play a second match while north of the border, which Goal has been told will be against Hibernian.</p>

<p>Andrea Pirlo has endured a baptism of fire during his first season as a coach, with the <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/pirlo-unfazed-by-juventus-exit-rumours-afters-speaking-with-club-/9ucq8zfect5o1l8gr58hijnai" target="_blank">World Cup winner facing serious questions over his future</a> during what has become a forgettable campaign for the Bianconeri.</p>

<p>The domestic crown has been snatched away by Inter, another early Champions League exit has been suffered and there is now plenty of speculation to suggest that key men - such as five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo - could soon head for the exits.</p>

<h3>What has been said?</h3>

<p>Juve have a crunch clash with newly-crowned champions Inter to come on Saturday and Vieri believes defeat in that contest will end top-four ambitions and spark a mass exodus.</p>

<p>The former Bianconeri striker told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXD164w5N_Q" target="_blank"><em>Bobo TV:</em></a> "For me, Inter will win in Turin and Juventus won’t play in the Champions League next season.</p>

<p>"Without Champions League football, Ronaldo will leave and many others will follow him, Juventus will face a severe financial crisis.</p>

<p>"It will be a dramatic failure and many players will leave."</p>

<h3>Who is Ronaldo being linked with?</h3>

<p><img alt="Cristiano Ronaldo Manchester United GFX" perform:prop="uuid:1bwzv6lcbxi2510m3a7q7okvax;width:1600;height:900" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/24/17/cristiano-ronaldo-manchester-united-gfx_6r6tqvy7hry81uv9x6mapyfw6.jpeg?t=437204161" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>The Portugal international is now 36 years of age, but notable records continue to tumble around him.</p>

<p>He has become the <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/ronaldo-becomes-fastest-player-to-reach-100-juventus-goals/1ie2lnhyz7z1c1ka0qv1rzwi9t" target="_blank">fastest player in Juve's illustrious history to reach 100 goals for the club</a>, with that mark hit in just 131 appearances.</p>

<p>Any number of teams around the world would be happy to buy into Ronaldo's ability and profile as he approaches the final 12 months of his current contract.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/man-utd-age-not-issue-ronaldo-return-berbatov-transfer/xf9t29kfb8ew1ovepie84o1uc" target="_blank">Returns to Real Madrid or Manchester United have been mooted</a>, while a <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/ronaldos-mother-vows-to-persuade-juve-star-to-return-to-sporting-/48fqzfsim56p1n2kidt4dokgq" target="_blank">homecoming at Sporting has also been speculated on.</a></p>

<p>Ronaldo has hinted in the past that a spell in MLS may appeal to him, while wealthy sides in the Middle East can also be expected to join the running if any exit door does open in Turin.</p>

<p>Paulo Dybala, with a century of goals for the Bianconeri to his name, is another being <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/dybala-contract-still-up-in-the-air-as-paratici-says/axquxj4phn271pya49k93ifgw" target="_blank">linked with a summer move elsewhere - as he is yet to sign a new contract </a>- with Douglas Costa, Aaron Ramsey, Wojciech Szczesny, Dejan Kulusevski, Alex Sandro and Adrien Rabiot <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ramsey-juventus-frustration-exit-talk-injury-struggles/4ycth3ic9h17zbvnj0mugnbl" target="_blank">also generating transfer talk.</a></p>

<p>Winterburn hopes continuity and stability will be sought, allowing a side in danger of missing out on continental competition in 2021-22 to start putting recruitment plans in place for a brighter future.</p>

<h3>What has been said?</h3>

<p>Quizzed on whether Arsenal are running the risk of missing out on Odegaard, former Gunners defender Winteburn - speaking in association with <a href="https://www.freesupertips.com/" target="_blank"><em>FreeSuperTips</em></a> - told <strong>Goal</strong>: "It will come down to what Real Madrid will want to do and whether he wants to stay there because he might not get the game time he wants.</p>

<p>"Arsenal would be in prime position; he's been here he knows what the club is like.</p>

<p>"He probably wants assurances that Arteta is going to be in charge because he wouldn't want to sign for a different manager.</p>

<p>"He's usually in the team and he's shown enough. He's a link up player, he’s very neat and tidy on the ball and we need creative players in around that area. I would think there will be other clubs looking at him as well, if he becomes available."</p>

<h3>The bigger picture</h3>

<p><img alt="Martin Odegaard Arsenal vs Tottenham Premier League 2020-21" perform:prop="uuid:w2rtg0lqus1d1luirnqu4lbtv;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/78/18/martin-odegaard-arsenal-vs-tottenham-premier-league-2020-21_ul8invd3b00e1mshwstcno32h.jpg?t=834745360" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>Odegaard pushed for the exits in Madrid as he struggled for regular game time under Zinedine Zidane.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/odegaard-captain-material-arsenal-elneny-permanent-transfer/15kumlhm718no1uqcylz8cl0xc" target="_blank">He has made 18 appearances for Arteta, scoring two goals</a>, and has rediscovered the spark that had started to fizzle out in Spain.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/odegaard-arsenal-future-loan-deal-real-madrid/12pmbnah12irw19ptjjcfs95d8" target="_blank">The 22-year-old has been leaving a door open for Arsenal</a> to discuss a long-term stay, but there are a number of factors to take into account, including <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/zidane-non-committal-real-madrid-future-deal-2022/1ricziqyl6g8k14wxf15tgsryw" target="_blank">no guarantee that Zidane will still be in charge of Real next season.</a></p>

<p>"I think it comes down to when he's been at the club, how he feels, how he's been treated, and does he feel again that potentially it's somewhere where he wants to be?" Winterburn added on the Gunners' chances of getting an agreement in place. "It's looking as if he would get quite a lot of game time, but is that enough for him?</p>

<p>"We've seen glimpses of what he can do, so that's an option I would think Arsenal would be looking at.</p>

<p>The German midfielder has come into contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, meaning that he must now stay away from the Blancos' main group.</p>

<p>Kroos has not contracted coronavirus himself, but every precaution is being taken to help prevent any spread within Zinedine Zidane's squad.</p>

<h3>What has been said?</h3>

<p>A statement released on the club's <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/noticias/2021/05/14/comunicado-oficial-toni-kroos" target="_blank"><em>official website</em></a> reads: "Real Madrid CF reports that our player Toni Kroos is in isolation as he has been in direct contact with a person who has tested positive for Covid-19, although all the tests that have been carried out on the player have been negative."</p>

<h3>The bigger picture</h3>

<p><img alt="Zidane Barcelona Real Madrid Clasico 2021" perform:prop="uuid:1ghoplxh64mcp1rx1s88kf9kct;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/db/c4/zidane-barcelona-real-madrid-clasico-2021_lrezpodawruu1kbhim1l86max.jpg?t=-1106810792" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>Zidane would have been hoping to have all of those not nursing injuries available to him for a trip to Bilbao.</p>

<p>Victory in that fixture is imperative for Real in their ongoing efforts to successfully defend their La Liga title.</p>

<p>They sit second in the table at present, two points behind neighbours Atletico Madrid with two games left to take in.</p>

<h3>Who is missing for Real?</h3>

<p>While Zidane does have options to cover any absence for Kroos, he does find himself short on options in defence.</p>

<p>Untimely setbacks have become an all too familiar theme for Real in the 2020-21 campaign.</p>

<p>With so much still on the line, they are once again <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ramos-injury-setback-real-madrid-contract-free-agency/1rg61zyozpaxs1p9knuh2ibi2w" target="_blank">unable to call upon the services of talismanic captain Sergio Ramos as he nurses a hamstring problem.</a></p>

<p>Ferland Mendy is also missing at left-back and <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/real-madrid-defender-mendy-ruled-out-of-la-liga-title-run-in/uwbxsssrtkuj1rd1mtxz4zwa8" target="_blank">faces a race against time to make France's squad for this summer's European Championship.</a></p>

<p>Lucas Vazquez is another to have seen his season brought to a close, with knee ligament damage keeping him on the sidelines, while Dani Carvajal is an experienced right-back option to have been ruled out of Zidane's plans.</p>

<p>An ambitious Bundesliga side that suffered a heavy defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the DFB-Pokal final on Thursday are already <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/upamecano-explains-bayern-munich-transfer-premier-league/dh3gfk62g681g35401xhcoke" target="_blank">preparing to bid farewell to Dayot Upamecano this summer - as he has a €42.5 million (£37m/$52m) agreement in place with Bayern Munich.</a></p>

<p>They are understandably reluctant to part with another promising French centre-half, but interest in talented 21-year-old Konate is building and Mintzlaff admits there is little he can do to prevent bids from being tabled.</p>

<h3>What has been said?</h3>

<p>Mintzlaff has told <a href="https://sport.sky.de/fussball" target="_blank"><em>Sky Deutschland</em></a>: "We’ll see what happens. I spoke to him this week. No decision has been made yet.</p>

<p>"There is an exit clause. That’s why we don’t sit in the driver’s seat. He is a player we want to keep."</p>

<h3>What is Konate's exit clause?</h3>

<p><img alt="Ibrahima Konate RB Leipzig" perform:prop="uuid:1h4xai0vn2o671ruahr5oxhgpa;width:1289;height:725" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/b5/42/ibrahima-konate-rb-leipzig_177cnqezsur171gu9xdhrta0ib.jpg?t=-488955113" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>RB Leipzig have stopped short of revealing what the fee stipulated in Konate's current deal is, but there has been plenty of speculation on that.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that an offer of €40 million (£35m/$48m) would be enough to trigger an exit.</p>

<p>Liverpool may decide that is a price worth paying, with Jurgen Klopp in the market for defensive reinforcements.</p>

<p>He has seen injury struggles, particularly at the back, hinder his cause considerably at Anfield this season.</p>

<p>Konate would be a shrewd investment for the present and future, with there plenty of potential still to be unlocked in his game, but he claimed in April to have had <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/there-are-often-rumours-many-believe-them-immediately-no-contact-/5jbygy93rd0b164s71hsud164" target="_blank">no contact with any of his many suitors.</a></p>

<p>Mane was seen snubbing his manager’s attempt at a handshake following the Reds’ 4-1 win at Old Trafford on Thursday.</p>

<p>The Senegal international had, it appears, been disappointed not to have started the game, with Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota and Mo Salah preferred by Klopp. All three justified their selection, scoring in what could prove a vital victory in the race for Champions League qualification.</p>

<h3>What’s been said?</h3>

<p>Klopp insisted after the game that there was no issue with Mane, that the issue was merely that he hadn’t had time to explain his decision to start Jota instead of the 29-year-old, and at a press conference ahead of the weekend trip to West Brom, the Reds boss was again able to brush off any suggestion of a rift.</p>

<p>Klopp told reporters: “I cannot make a bigger story of it as it is. Football is an emotional game and everyone expects from us to control our emotions always. It doesn't work out always, that's the case.</p>

<p>"It happened to me as a player, it happened to other players when I was their coach. We had so far no real chance to talk about it but we will and there will be nothing left. Everything will be fine.</p>

<p>"Do you want these things to happen? No. But it's not the first time in my life and I'm afraid to say it won't be the last time."</p>

<p>He added: “The thing is, if somebody shows me respect five million times, and one time not, what is more important?</p>

<p>“The world is in this situation where you [the media] make this one time bigger than necessary. That is unfortunately the case, and I hope for you that your boss will not forget, if one time you don’t show him respect, all the other stuff. Even now, I can see the headlines you will make.</p>

<p>“I am completely relaxed about it. If you’d have seen me as a player, what I did out of emotion, it was insane! I’m a completely normal guy, but it happened to me.</p>

<p>“Nothing else. We will talk about and it will be sorted. That’s all.”</p>

<h3>Liverpool and the top four</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">The Reds head to The Hawthorns knowing a win would keep them on track for a top-four finish.</span></p>

<p>Should the Reds win their remaining three games - away to West Brom and Burnley, and at home to Crystal Palace - they would be in the box seat to pip either Chelsea or Leicester, who meet at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Whatever the outcome of that game, Liverpool know that three wins would give them a great chance of sneaking into the final qualification spot, although it could well come down to goal difference with Leicester, who face Tottenham at home in their final game. </p>

<p>Chelsea, currently fourth and with a Champions League final to prepare for, travel to Aston Villa on the final day. </p>

<p>He has been a model for some of the biggest brands in the world, eventually establishing his own fashion range, including fragrances and, in early 2018, he officially became the owner of Major League Soccer expansion team Inter Miami.</p>

<h2><a id="films" name="films"></a>What films has David Beckham been in?</h2>

<p>Beckham became involved in the film industry during his playing career and the first real forays into the business came when he was at Real Madrid.</p>

<p>At the beginning, aside from appearing in advertisements for the likes of Adidas and PepsiCo, the midfielder tended to play himself in cameo roles - the <em>Goal!</em> series being an example of this - but since retiring he has taken on some more diverse roles.</p>

<p>He has worked with director Guy Ritchie on a number of occasions, appearing in the 2015 film <em>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</em> as a projectionist and most recently he had a more prominent role in <em>King Arthur: Legend of the Sword</em> (2017).</p>

<p>Beckham has also featured in a couple of short films, made as part of fashion campaigns, alongside the likes of Harvey Keitel, Katharine Waterston and Kevin Hart.</p>

<p><img alt="Charlie Hunnam David Beckham King Arthur 2015" perform:prop="uuid:1ha19p9s61p8z17bic1pz6kutp;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/GOAL/b1/80/charlie-hunnam-david-beckham-king-arthur-2015_eaj1cgc9ljwl1nn2cp5drucxo.jpg?t=-1814620943" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>He played a silent motorcyle stuntman, with Keitel and Waterston, in the short film <em>Outlaws</em> (2015), which was produced by the English fashion brand Belstaff.</p>

<p>He also played a fictionalised version of himself in a H&M short featuring Hart called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTNlQgA5A6A" target="_blank"><em>The Road Trip</em></a> (2016).</p>

<p>Despite the fact that he has been popping up in films and regularly showing up at film business events, Beckham has denied that he is pursuing it as a serious career path. Instead, he has suggested that it is simply a hobby.</p>

<p>He told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdCXJmH_Z9c" target="_blank"><em>ABC News</em></a> in 2015: "I've never, ever thought about going into any kind of acting. People have actually started talking about me and my 'new career of acting'. It's not my new career, it's just something that I'm stepping into and enjoying myself with."</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UtFRn_aGXhc" width="100%"></iframe>

<p>Given that he does not have a background in acting, his efforts have been scrutinised, but Ritchie, who, as mentioned, cast Beckham in two of his films, has defended the former England international.</p>

<p>In 2017, at the launch of <em>King Arthur</em>, the director said: "He's fabulous and I think you'll find that anyone who can be objective about this will agree. It might be easy for critics to have a go, but they want a headline. He's really very good."</p>

<p>Beckham's co-star Charlie Hunnam echoed Ritchie's comments and paid tribute to the 42-year-old's famous work ethic. </p>

<p>"I thought he was incredible. Not only how well he did, but the preparation he put in, the discipline and just the real burning desire to do a good job," Hunnam said. </p>

<p>"It became clear why he enjoyed so much success in his career. He's obviously a perfectionist who puts his heart and soul into everything he does. I was really impressed."</p>

<p>In 2014, Beckham appeared alongside David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst in a special edition of the iconic British TV sitcom <em>Only Fools and Horses</em>.</p>

<p>The sketch was part of that year's Comic Relief and the former Manchester United man cheekily recreated a famous scene from the series. As well as playing himself, Beckham has a writing credit for the short, which was called 'Beckham in Peckham'.</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w7YBuMhKhXE" width="100%"></iframe>

<p>Beckham's forays into acting and Hollywood coincided with his move to California and there were even humorous calls for him to be considered as the next James Bond.</p>

<p>Those calls were subsequently lampooned in 2017 on an episode of <em>The Late Late Show with James Corden</em>, in which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1VEG7Ku2Ys" target="_blank">Beckham goes up against Corden for the role of Bond</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><em><strong>Return to top</strong></em></a></p>

<h2><a id="footballers-acting" name="footballers-acting"></a>Have any other footballers gone into acting?</h2>

<p><img alt="Pele Escape to Victory" perform:prop="uuid:1vve7lb4kx7571ak3ia6kgav2y;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.performgroup.com/di/library/GOAL/64/e6/pele-escape-to-victory_173ok45jc0b2m1v61ry4i214mu.jpg?t=1960563968" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>A surprising number of footballers have turned their hand to the entertainment business and Beckham is in diverse company in that regard.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most successful footballer-turned-actor is former WImbledon and Wales midfielder <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/vinnie-jones-from-football-hard-man-to-hollywood-actor/1vvlimy99lcx812rg17ibm9cvy" target="_blank">Vinnie Jones</a>, who has forged a respectable career in the crime-action-comedy film circuit. Jones won an Empire Award for Best Newcomer for his part in <em>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</em> in 1999 and has shown impressive adaptability in his subsequent roles. </p>

<p>Another former Man United no. 7 has also dipped into the realm of acting: <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/eric-cantonas-movies-all-ex-manchester-united-footballers-acting-/14totp3errwuy1f1pk9rxzt50k" target="_blank">Eric Cantona.</a> The fiery French star has featured in a number of films, including the 1998 biographical movie <em>Elizabeth</em>, starring Cate Blanchett. Cantona also played a fictionalised version of himself in the Ken Loach film <em>Looking for Eric</em> (2009).</p>

<p>Former Rangers and Scotland star Ally McCoist was the hero footballer in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Shot_at_Glory" target="_blank"><em>A Shot at Glory</em></a> (2002), which featured a glittering cast, including Michael Keaton, Brian Cox and multiple-time Academy Award nominee Robert Duvall. Stan Collymore, who made his name as a star striker for Liverpool, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest, had a role in <em>Basic Instinct 2</em> (2006), opposite Sharon Stone.</p>

<p>Of course, Pele, universally regarded as one of the greatest footballers of all time, was one of the forerunners to all of the above, having starred in John Huston's war-time fantasy football classic <a href="http://www.goal.com/en/news/escape-to-victory-pele-sylvester-stallone-war-time-football/1qxws1xzxul6y1peyiq6m2ljrc" target="_blank"><em>Escape to Victory</em></a> (1981) alongside Sylvester Stallone and Michael Caine. England's World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore was also involved, as well as a host of other footballers.</p>

<p>Koch joined Leeds from Bundesliga outfit Freiburg for £13 million ($18m) last summer, committing to a four-year contract at Elland Road.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old has helped the Whites fight for a top-ten Premier League finish this season, and he credits Bielsa for taking his game to the next level with his unique approach on the training pitch.</p>

<h3>What's been said?</h3>

<p>Koch told <strong>Goal</strong> and <strong>SPOX</strong>: "Anyone who has seen our games this season knows how intense they are. It's constantly back and forth and we give full throttle for 90 minutes.</p>

<p>"For the spectator, it's very entertaining. For us players, it also requires a lot of strength and stamina. Training under Marcelo Bielsa is therefore also very special, but I am sure that it makes us all better players. I definitely see a further development in me personally this season.<br />
<br />
"Passing and build-up play, overall playing with the ball is very important for us and of course we train that way. So I think it's already the case that I've improved in that again here at Leeds."  </p>

<h3>Bielsa's record at Leeds</h3>

<p>Bielsa took the top job at Elland Road back in 2018, and guided Leeds to the Championship play-offs in his first full season at the helm.</p>

<p>Leeds ultimately lost in the semi-finals to Derby County, but bounced back to win the division in 2019-20 and seal their return to the Premier League after a 16-year absence.</p>

<p>Bielsa's men have given a good account of themselves in the top-flight, rising to 10th after 35 fixtures, and could still mathematically finish as high as fifth if they win their remaining three games against Burnley, Southampton and West Brom.</p>

<h3>How has Koch performed for Leeds?</h3>

<p>Koch was a regular in Bielsa's line-up in the first half of the season, and he impressed with his defensive skills and willingness to get forward.</p>

<p>However, a serious knee injury disrupted his progress in early December, but he returned in a 2-1 win over Fulham on March 19 and now has 17 Premier League appearances to his name.</p>

<p>Koch is hoping he can go on to make Germany's squad for Euro 2020, and said: "I've been working hard, I'm back to 100% after my injury and fit for the European Championships.</p>

<p>"It's good to be back in the starting eleven and to be able to prepare for it in the best possible way. I can get more match practice in our last games in the Premier League."  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/the-hunt-is-on-firmino-and-liverpool-show-their-teeth-at-exactly-/1k011qqs66u001bodlgp8riw9w" target="_blank">The Reds were walking off the field at Old Trafford with a vital 4-2 victory</a> under their belts when Klopp endeavoured to acknowledge that achievement with his players.</p>

<p>There were plenty of fist bumps and hugs from the charismatic coach, but his advances were snubbed by Mane - with the Senegalese forward not taking kindly to being left out of Klopp's starting XI and seeing only 16 minutes off the bench.</p>

<h3>What has been said?</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/klopp-reacts-to-manes-angry-handshake-snub-its-all-fine/1fkqmyr2uute31ibfneudxwdo4" target="_blank">Klopp played down the incident when quizzed on it afterwards</a>, but former Liverpool striker Owen told <a href="https://www.premierleague.com/video/all" target="_blank"><em>Premier League Productions</em></a> of an unnecessary show of petulance: "I thought Jurgen Klopp played it well in the interview, played it down, didn’t want to take the shine off what was a great performance and a great win.</p>

<p>"But, and there is a big but, you can’t do that to your manager, not in front of the glaring public. </p>

<p>"Yes, go knock on his door tomorrow, yes, if you’re not happy then say something, but you don’t do that. That’s a lack of respect. It sends a bad image to the fans, to his team-mates. </p>

<p>"Don’t forget, he didn’t play, three players did, those three players – [Mohamed] Salah, [Diogo] Jota and [Roberto] Firmino – scored all four goals between them, so he’s [Klopp] hardly wrong in what he did. </p>

<p>"I said before the game I’d play Mane, I think he’s wonderful, I think he’s a brilliant player, I love watching him, I’d have hated to have played against him if I were a defender.</p>

<p>"But at the end of the day, the team that he did pick, the three strikers scored four goals. You [Mane] just can’t do that. That’s a lack of respect, especially with Jurgen Klopp who shows respect to everybody. I thought it was poor play. </p>

<p>"I totally understand it, I’ve been left out of a cup final before, but you can’t do that. If you feel that strongly, go back to the training ground, text the manager or knock on his door, anything, so many different ways of reacting bar that one in front of the cameras. There’s so many ways you can deal with it, that’s the last way you deal with it."</p>

<h3>Who else has had their say?</h3>

<p><img alt="Sadio Mane, Jurgen Klopp - Liverpool" perform:prop="uuid:1o6fsq0ebob8g1o5veyvcfpjpz;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/3e/a7/sadio-mane-jurgen-klopp-liverpool_13m2u76brool41v8mfcg6a9i73.jpg?t=1743000097" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>Plenty of supporters took to social media to offer their take on Mane's actions, with plenty questioning his decision to publicly shun a coach that has made him a Champions League and Premier League title winner.</p>

<p>Liverpool legend Graeme Souness was another to stick the boot in, with the Scot telling <a href="https://twitter.com/SkySportsPL/status/1392959984535810048" target="_blank"><em>Sky Sports</em></a>: "Disrespectful. If I was the manager I wouldn’t be happy.</p>

<p>"He should show a bit of respect. It’s disrespectful to the manager and the club.</p>

<p>"How can he argue? He’s not had a great season and Liverpool have won here 4-2."</p>

<h3>The bigger picture</h3>

<p>Mane has been left out at times this season after <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/mane-admits-to-worst-season-of-my-career-and-cant-explain/88achn8f48cm1iquwtv1yzj9q" target="_blank">struggling to maintain the standards he has set across a productive spell at Anfield.</a></p>

<p>He has only hit 14 goals across all competitions, with Portugal international Jota now posing fierce competition for his place.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/the-front-three-need-breaking-up-carragher-calls-on-liverpool-to-/zjt94otkdiob11jxv7f44ztwf" target="_blank">Transfer talk has resurfaced around Mane in 2020-21</a>, with supposed interest from Spain seemingly never far away, but he is tied to a contract through to 2023.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether that agreement will be honoured and whether the 29-year-old will be back in favour with his boss when top four-chasing Liverpool take in a trip to relegated West Brom on Sunday.</p>

<p>A summer move away from Juventus is being mooted for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner, as he approaches the final 12 months of his contract in Turin.</p>

<p>Various landing spots are being speculated on for the 36-year-old, from Old Trafford to MLS <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/hes-magnificent-zidane-reacts-to-ronaldo-return-rumours-at/1f21bnlnr9qqr15mmzabg8xtgq" target="_blank">via a second stint at Real Madrid</a>, and Berbatov believes an all-time great still has plenty to offer at the very top of the game.</p>

<p>"I've read that Cristiano Ronaldo will be leaving. If that is the case, I'm sure people connected to United would love for him to come home.</p>

<p>"He's 36 but with his shape and form, I don't see that being an issue for him if he was to come back to United.</p>

<p>"I think he will be looking for another challenge of a new place, he has done it at United, Real Madrid and Juventus, so he may want to go to a new club to prove to himself, but he may prefer to go back to United for a year or two. </p>

<p>"Sporting have just been crowned champions in Portugal and that is another possibility for him also."</p>

<h3>The bigger picture</h3>

<p>Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, has said that she will be trying to <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ronaldos-mother-vows-to-persuade-juve-star-to-return-to-sporting-/48fqzfsim56p1n2kidt4dokgq" target="_blank">convince her son to return to his roots at Sporting.</a></p>

<p>Juve, though, have been <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/pirlo-and-ronaldo-will-stay-at-juventus-nedved-rubbishes/1ay73lh6y58sz15ezcqhcwsm7u" target="_blank">doing all they can to quash the rumours</a> regarding an impending exit for a prized asset.</p>

<p>They have seen Ronaldo become the <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/ronaldo-becomes-fastest-player-to-reach-100-juventus-goals/1ie2lnhyz7z1c1ka0qv1rzwi9t" target="_blank">fastest player in their history to reach 100 goals for the club</a>, with the evergreen performer proving that he still has what it takes to compete at the highest level.</p>

<p>The Bianconeri have, however, surrendered their grip on the Serie A title this season and endured another early exit from the Champions League, with changes now expected to be implemented on and off the field at the Allianz Stadium.</p>

<p>He was a west London kid looking to follow in his footballing brother's footsteps, with a father who coached at a local level. He managed to get his foot in the door at his boyhood club Chelsea, who offered him the slimmest chance to graduate from one of the world's best academies.</p>

<p>Back then, the FA Cup Final was a chance for the aspiring James to watch his heroes star for his favourite club even if getting a ticket for the showpiece was impossible.</p>

<p>Now, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/live/chelsea-news-transfer-updates-rumours/1xsr4rd4h9njx16sesygsi6gal" target="_blank">he’s gearing up to face Leicester at Wembley on Saturday.</a></p>

<p>"I have always dreamed of playing in a final as a Chelsea player. I didn't see one live. It was mainly all watching it on TV when I was young. I used to dream and hope one day I would be in a similar position, to lift trophies at the club I support," James said.</p>

<p>James is a genuine Chelsea supporter who used to pretend to be Didier Drogba, who scored in four FA Cup final victories for the Blues, and he even had a shirt signed by the whole team framed above his bed.</p>

<p>"Drogba has always been my idol," he responded to <strong>Goal</strong> in a chat with select media brands ahead of this weekend’s showdown.</p>

<p>"He would always score in the big games whenever we needed a goal, knocking it over the line."</p>

<p>"I still have the shirt signed by the whole Chelsea team from when I was maybe seven or eight. It was a great inspiration growing up as I would look at the shirt every day.</p>

<p>"Now, I'm in the first team and people are asking for my signature. At the start, that was a bit weird but as time has gone on I've got used to it."</p>

<p><img alt="Didier Drogba GFX Chelsea" perform:prop="uuid:1mv50fs6nlr3t1oedzgbi75h8p;width:1080;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/d9/ff/didier-drogba-gfx-chelsea_aogmx4pdeu23192mfi4fqead3.jpeg?t=1773262641" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p>James moved from being a Drogba-loving forward to starring in defence as he forged his identity as a young player. And the 21-year-old knows that things could have been different for him, having seen his talented brother Joshua released by Fulham and Reading. James himself also came close to the exit door.</p>

<p>"My toughest time was when I was around 15 or 16 years old,” he said. “It was around the time of my exams that I wasn't sure I was going to get a contract. So, everything was up in the air.</p>

<p>“That was the toughest moment in my academy career.” But James dug in and found his way to the first team.</p>

<p>Once he graduated to the senior squad, Frank Lampard's influence as manager was key. He trusted the then-teenager to play a crucial part in Chelsea's season of transition during a transfer ban.</p>

<p>"If it wasn't for him, you could argue I wouldn't be playing now. I am always thankful for what he did for me," admitted James. "It definitely helps a lot when someone who has had a career like him believes in you and it gives you a real confidence boost as well.</p>

<p>"I worked with [Lampard's former assistant] Jody [Morris] in the academy, so they helped integrate us into the first team and I think that had a massive positive impact.”</p>

<p>The sacking of Lampard in January was heart-wrenching for everyone associated with the club.</p>

<p>In an unprecedented step, owner Roman Abramovich even issued a statement outlining his regret at having to take such action. It may have been a difficult decision but <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/less-chaos-guardiola-v-tuchel-define-post-pandemic-premier/102hlskjt2vel158553c3uoohq" target="_blank">replacing Lampard has proven to be a masterstroke.</a></p>

<p><img alt="Reece James Thomas Tuchel GFX Chelsea" perform:prop="uuid:b7ld49tl6xna13o3czp32t93h;width:1920;height:1080" src="https://images.daznservices.com/di/library/GOAL/dc/4b/reece-james-thomas-tuchel-gfx-chelsea_zytkfg8nw8ii1xby22g3ec5uo.jpeg?t=1773262641" style="width: 100%; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" /></p>

<p><a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/live/chelsea-news-transfer-updates-rumours/5xnqdwbrn3uh13eo64h2olup7" target="_blank">Thomas Tuchel's impact has been immense,</a> taking the club from 10th place to fourth in the Premier League, and leading them to the FA Cup and Champions League finals.</p>

<p>“It was very difficult when a new manager came in,” James said. “I didn't know what to expect and then we had to move fast because the games were coming fast."</p>

<p>"I was devastated that he [Lampard] was going. But I was also excited that a new opportunity was going to happen.</p>

<p>"I didn’t really know what was going to happen, but as time went on, our results turned around and our form picked up and we grew and got stronger as a team.</p>

<p>"[Tuchel’s] tactics are very different to what we were playing at the start of the season. We have changed formations and lots of roles have changed but I think as games go on, we get a stronger spirit.</p>

<p>"He made it very evident and clear what our goals are for this season; what we needed to do. One of them was to finish in the top four and the other one was winning trophies. We are in two finals now.</p>

<p>"I would say this season is the one where I have learned the most. Before this, I have never had to deal with a new manager coming in midway through a season. That's probably been my first learning curve.</p>

<p>"Then, I just think getting to grips and learning the way new players play is quite difficult as well. Once you get the hang of that and start gelling as a team, [it is easier]."</p>

<p>While Robert Lewandowski continues to carry the flag for the country's national team, the Bayern Munich star will turn 33 before the summer is out.</p>

<p>Though he is arguably in the best form of his career as he closes in on Gerd Muller's all-time record for the most goals in a single Bundesliga season, which stands at 40 (Lewandowski has 39 in 2020-21), there is an acceptance that he cannot go on forever.</p>

<p>As such, the emergence of <a href="http://www.kacperkozlowski.com/">Kacper Kozlowski</a> over the past couple of seasons has offered hope to Polish fans that they will soon have another global superstar to call their own.</p>

<p>Things could, however, have been very different.</p>

<p>In January 2020, Kozlowski and two of his Pogon Szczecin team-mates were involved in a car crash while on their way to training.</p>

<p>Kozlowski was the most badly hurt of the three, suffering a broken pelvis and three broken vertebrae in his lower back. As a result of the spinal damage, he was fitted with a special corset to wear while he recovered.</p>

<p>And though the injuries were never thought to be career-threatening, that Kozlowski has been able to overcome that adversity is testament to his resolve.</p>

<p>"I couldn't train for almost half a year," Kozlowski tells <strong>Goal</strong> in an exclusive interview, "which is the worst thing that can happen as a young player.</p>

<p>"But after I got back to individual training, I felt like things were back on track and going in the right direction.</p>

<p>"It was a difficult time in my life, but I focus on the here and now and not on the past. It is a fact that I missed a few matches, but frankly, I have been working even harder since then.</p>

<p>"Mentally, it might help me in the future to have gone through this."</p>

<p>Kozlowski certainly seems to be making up for lost time, with the 17-year-old having locked down a starting role in the Pogon midfield as the 2020-21 campaign has worn on.</p>

<p>He was also a surprise selection for Paulo Sousa's first Poland senior squad in March, and having made his debut against Andorra in World Cup qualifying, the door is now open for Kozlowski to be one of the youngest players at this summer's European Championship.</p>

<p>That is all a long way from his humble beginnings, with the teenager having not had any formal coaching until the age of 10, instead choosing only to play with his friends at home or on the street.</p>

<p>He eventually joined local side Baltyk Koszalin, who immediately realised they had a special talent on their hands.</p>

<p>It is claimed that some of their training sessions would consist of Kozlowski and one outfield team-mate being pitted against a team of six in a bid to ensure an equal game, so far ahead of his peers was the precocious youngster.</p>

<p>After three years, he was spotted by Pogon, who in turn fought off competition from Lech Poznan to land Kozlowski.</p>

<p>"When he entered the academy, he was very confident," recalled Pogon youth coach Patryk Dabrowski to <em>Sport.pl</em>. "He is very confident, but not wayward or arrogant. He balances on this fine line, but does not exceed it.</p>

<p>"It helps him on the pitch, because, for example, he is not afraid to dribble or play unconventionally. It's not uncommon for young footballers to have skills, but they don't get the most out of them during matches. Their head limits them, which is why they intuitively opt for simpler solutions.</p>

<p>"Kacper does not have that – his head is in tune with his legs. He just knows that he is good."</p>

<p>Kozlowski quickly began motoring through the various age-group sides at Pogon, and having scored nine goals and laid on four assists in 15 games for the Under-19s during the 2018-19 campaign, he found himself training with the first team at the age of 15.</p>

<p>Having suitably impressed manager Kosta Runjaic, he made his debut as a late substitute in Pogon's final game of the Ekstraklasa season against Cracovia Krakow. At 15 years and 215 days, he ranked as the third-youngest player in the league's history.</p>

<p>Four months later, in September 2019, Kozlowski was impressing scouts from around Europe as he helped lead Poland U17s to the final of Syrenka Cup on home soil.</p>

<p>There they would face an England team captained by Jude Bellingham, as Kozlowski joined Harvey Elliott and Jamal Musiala in getting himself on the scoresheet in a 2-2 draw, before the Three Lions eventually triumphed on penalties.</p>

<p>One of the teams with officials in attendance were <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/man-utd-tracking-polish-wonderkid-kozlowski-who-made-senior/1h2pykiblipg51c7w5qmms7u9n" target="_blank">Manchester United, who along with clubs from France, Italy and Germany began closely tracking Kozlowski's development.</a></p>

<p>That development, of course, ground to a halt following his accident at the start of 2020, but after returning to action in pre-season, he has gone from strength to strength in 2021.</p>

<p>"Such a boy is only born every few years," said Dabrowski. "So far, I have not dealt with a more talented footballer.</p>

<p>"And you see, I'm not afraid that these words will hurt him, because he is dealing with this noise, with these expectations or pressure. It actually motivates him to work even harder."</p>

<p>That is certainly the case for Kozlowski, who is keen to improve on all attributes of his game, having returned one goal and three assists from 19 league games this season.</p>

<p>"Ever since I was a young boy, my idol has been Cristiano Ronaldo. However, over time, I started to like and watch Paul Pogba more," he says.</p>

<p>"I think I can give more to the team as an offensive midfielder, but I can also work as a defensive midfielder.</p>

<p>"I work on both sides of my game, offensively and defensively, but I feel better in an advanced role. I am a player who likes to compete and fight for everything, take risks and likes to go one-on-one or even one-versus-two.</p>

<p>"I would like to improve my shots from long range and maybe also my decision-making."</p>

<p>If Kozlowski can make the necessary improvements to his game, then a move to one of Europe's top leagues may not be too far away.</p>

<p>"Kacper is an exceptional talent," said Runjaic in a recent interview with <em>Super Express</em>. "If everything goes well from his point of view, we will see him playing in one of the leading leagues in Europe. He is already ready to do so."</p>

<p>Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen have previously been linked with Kozlowski, whose contract is up in 2022, while recent reports suggest scouts from Red Bull Salzburg, Torino and Saint-Etienne have been to watch him in action.</p>

<p>Despite all the talk of transfers and call-ups for major international tournaments, Kozlowski is keeping a level head.</p>

<p>"Now I am playing senior football; it doesn't feel too different from my youth career. I treat every match the same," he says.</p>

<p>"It is still an amazing feeling to be playing with such great players and at this level, I have learned that I need to make decisions faster on the pitch.</p>

<p>"For now, I would like to give something back to Pogon. Then I would like to play abroad soon and get more chances for the Polish national team."</p>

<p>Those chances will, sooner or later, be almost assured.</p>

<p>He might not play like Lewandowski, but soon enough expect Kozlowski to follow in his footsteps in carrying the hopes of Polish football on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Gameweek 36 of the Fantasy Premier League is here and with only three rounds of fixtures left to go, we're entering crunch time in your FPL mini-leagues.</p>

<p>A reduced gameweek for this weekend sees Manchester United, Leicester, Chelsea and Arsenal all without a league fixture, with in-form Liverpool aiming to further close the gap to the top four.</p>

<p>Check out the below as <strong>Goal </strong>offers team news, captain recommendations and more as you look to turn those arrows green and climb your FPL <strong> </strong> league tables in the final knockings of the 2020-21 campaign.</p>

<p>Given Pep Guardiola's usual policy of rotation, it's difficult to pinpoint a reliable captain pick for Manchester City, and thus we're drawn to Liverpool and their away clash at West Brom.</p>

<p>Indeed, <strong>Mohamed Salah</strong>, who has a goal or assist in each of his last three Premier League matches, is the standout pick, with the Egyptian now level with Harry Kane <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/premier-league-top-scorers-2020-21/1qhjpasnphotl1lyikjfv6whva" target="_blank">in the race for the Golden Boot.</a></p>

<p>One of the major talking points within the international game in the 21st century has been the practice of switching teams, which has been facilitated by FIFA. Indeed, there are now plenty of examples where footballers have represented a country, even up to senior level, before later declaring for another country.</p>

<p>In late 2020, FIFA announced at its 70th annual congress that the <strong>eligibility rules</strong> had been updated, in what administrators have described as the "first wholesale modernisation" of the rules, with added codification and clarification.</p>

<p>So, in case you are scratching your head about it all, <strong>Goal</strong> takes a look at why it is that players can change national team, what the new rules say and some of the high-profile examples of switches.</p>

</ol>

<h2><a id="why" name="why"></a>Why can footballers change international teams?</h2>

<p>Footballers can change international team thanks to the FIFA eligibility rules. <strong>Article 9</strong> of FIFA's Regulations Governing the Application of the Statutes deals with changing association.</p>

<p>The rules allow a player to change their national team allegiance only once, but the 2020 update also facilitates a reversal of a change request in certain specific circumstances.</p>

<p>FIFA allows footballers to change their international team allegiance in recognition of the complexities of <strong>individual identity</strong> that accompany the increasingly <strong>globalised society</strong> in which we live.</p>

<p>It is generally accepted that there are many players who hold more than one nationality and whose attachment to a particular country or countries is inherently nuanced.</p>

<p>FIFA president Gianni Infantino has explicitly acknowledged the need to create regulatory space for situations pertaining to players who, for example, may have been born in one country then raised in another or cases where a player has parents from different countries.</p>

<p>Speaking at the FIFA Football Law Annual Review in March 2021, Infantino explained: "We have amended the eligibility rules for national teams because it is important in a globalised world where players maybe have two or three different nationalities that they are given the opportunity to choose their country or to change - if certain strict conditions are met.</p>

<p>"We needed to address situations of particular hardship and that is what made us go in that direction."</p>

<p>While some, including a number of current and ex-professional footballers, may hold the view that once you play for one country, your colours have been nailed to the mast, FIFA is committed to a legal regulatory framework which aims to avoid the experience of "excessive hardship" on the part of players.</p>

<p>The term "excessive hardship" features a number of times in the commentary which was published in tandem with the rule update and it relates to situations where players are effectively denied the chance of an international career.</p>

<p><a href="#top"><em><strong>Return to top</strong></em></a></p>

<h2><a id="new-rules" name="new-rules"></a>What are the new eligibility rules?</h2>

<p>The new eligibility rules build on the foundation of the <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/fifa-national-team-eligibility-rules-players-who-have/1hndiedxd2d4h1jfved27pg4go" target="_blank">rules that had already been in place prior to September 2020.</a></p>

<p>So, the basis of the eligibility rules is effectively the same, but there have been a number of clarifications and some additional insertions.</p>

<p>In particular, FIFA has added <strong>three new exceptions</strong> whereby a player may change the national team they play for.</p>

<p><strong>First,</strong> it is now possible for a player to change national team even if they have played competitively at senior level, provided:</p>

<ol>
	<li>the player held the nationality of their new association at the time of their first official appearance for their first national team.</li>
	<li>the player played in no more than three <strong>competitive</strong> senior games before the age of 21.</li>
	<li>the player has not played in the final stage of an official tournament such as the World Cup, European Championship, Copa America etc.</li>
	<li>at least three years have passed since the player's last senior appearance for their previous national team.</li>
</ol>

<p>So, a player who is eligible for England and Republic of Ireland could, for the sake of argument, play for England in three World Cup 2022 qualification games, then represent Ireland at the 2026 World Cup. The opposite - playing at a World Cup then switching - is not permitted.</p>

<p><strong>Second,</strong> a player can now change to a new national team even if they did not hold that nationality at the time of their first appearance for their old national team, as long as they last played for the old national team before the age of 21.</p>

<p>It should be noted that there is an exception underpinned by the principle of legal certainty, whereby the age limit of 21 does not apply to players who played their last match for their old national team prior to September 18, 2020, when the new rules were introduced. This exception explains why Aymeric Laporte, who played for France Under-21s at the age of 21 in 2016, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/laporte-granted-spanish-citizenship-as-he-aims-to-play-for-spain-/bcc8wq7oml8r1pwhg6efmj6vg" target="_blank">is permitted to switch to Spain.</a></p>

<p><strong>Finally,</strong> a competitive cap will not keep a player tied to a national team in the event that they suddenly become stateless - that is, lose their nationality - against their will.</p>

<script async="async" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<h3>Nationality is key</h3>

<p><strong>Nationality</strong> continues to underpin the rules and remains the starting point of the entire concept of national team eligibility. As <strong>Article 5.1</strong> states:</p>

<p><em>"Any person holding a permanent nationality that is not dependent on residence in a certain country is eligible to play for the representative teams of the association of that country."</em></p>

<p>In some cases, a nationality could potentially entitle you to play for more than one FIFA member association <a href="#nationalities-more-one-team">(see below)</a> and <strong>Article 6</strong> comes into play.</p>

<p>For example, a total of 11 national teams (including the four 'Home Nations') require a player to possess British nationality in order to be eligible, but Article 6 indicates that they must also satisfy one of the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The player was born on the territory of the association.</li>
	<li>The player's biological mother or father was born on the territory of the association.</li>
	<li>The player's grandmother or grandfather was born on the territory of the association.</li>
	<li>The player has lived on the territory of the association for at least five years.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a player acquires a new nationality in order to play for a national team, <strong>Article 7</strong> applies and the above stipulations also apply in such a scenario.</p>

<p>FIFA has published a wonderfully digestible video explainer of the rules <a href="https://youtu.be/J8ZhAs-B2U8" target="_blank">which can be watched on the federation's official YouTube channel here.</a> Alternatively, if you are keen to read the rules in their entirety, <a href="https://resources.fifa.com/image/upload/fifa-statutes-2020.pdf" target="_blank">you can access FIFA's Statutes (2020 edition) here.</a></p>

<h2><a id="footballers-who-switched" name="footballers-who-switched"></a>Which footballers have switched national teams?</h2>

<p>Declan Rice famously switched allegiance from the Republic of Ireland to England in 2019, despite having played three friendly games for the Irish senior team.</p>

<p>There have been a number of other high profile examples, such as Diego Costa (Brazil to Spain), Kevin-Prince Boateng (Germany to Ghana) and Wilfried Zaha (England to Ivory Coast).</p>

<h2><a id="how-many-times-switch" name="how-many-times-switch"></a>How many times can footballers switch national teams?</h2>

<p>The eligibility rules allow a footballer to change their national team allegiance only <strong>once</strong> - but the new rules do allow for a <strong>reversal</strong> of that one switch in certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Confusion has understandably arisen among the football community regarding players who appear to have switched more than once.</p>

<p>Former Bayern Munich youth Ryan Johansson, for example, has played in games for Luxembourg, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>However, many of those appearances came in unofficial competition. In other words, they were friendly games, some of which were played at non-FIFA age groups (such as Under-16 or Under-18 schoolboy).</p>

<p>His only official, competitive appearances were for Luxembourg, meaning he could still potentially elect to use his one request to change.</p>

<p>In its commentary of the rules update, FIFA has indicated a desire to combat what it terms 'nationality shopping' - so switching back and forth or playing for a number of different national teams is evidently frowned upon.</p>

<p>The nationalities which cover more than one international team are American, British, Chinese, Danish, French, Dutch and New Zealand.</p>

<p>Political peculiarities and historic links are the reason for the shared nationalities.</p>

<p>In order to play for the United States national team, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa or the U.S. Virgin Islands, a footballer must first have American nationality.</p>

<p>The list is even bigger when it comes to British nationality, which is not only needed to play for England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The other national teams which require their players to have British nationality include Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Montserrat.</p>

<p>With an iconic programme having been off our screens for 17 years, the countdown is on to the moment that Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Phoebe get back together.</p>

<p>There will be no new episodes made, but everyone's favourite New York coffee house dwellers are ready to get reacquainted - with a few other famous faces being thrown into the mix for good measure.</p>

<h3>When will the Friends reunion be aired?</h3>

<p>The original series of Friends ran from 1994 to 2004, with 236 episodes aired across 10 seasons.</p>

<p>A reunion was initially due to be run back in March 2020, but those plans had to be shelved due to the Covid-19 outbreak.</p>

<p>Schedules have now been revised, with a trailer released entitled 'The One Where They Get Back Together'.</p>

<h3>Beckham's acting career</h3>

<p>Having embraced the limelight during his playing days, and spent time in California during his time with the LA Galaxy, <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/news/david-beckhams-acting-career-films-tv-and-cameos-of-former/9jhmzuo576k51isv5q9af37rh" target="_blank">life on the big screen is nothing new to Beckham.</a></p>
