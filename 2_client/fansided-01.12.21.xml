      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>With Albert Pujols still out there in free agency, why haven&#x2019;t the St. Louis Cardinals been able to lock things up with him yet?&#xA0;</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">MLB fans continue to see stud free agents fly off the board and find new homes. So, what&#x2019;s the holdup with <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/03/06/albert-pujols-retirement-yadier-molina/">Albert Pujols?&#xA0;</a>Despite now being in his 40s, Pujols isn&#x2019;t ready to hang up his cleats just yet.</p><p>With him still having some pop in his bat, multiple teams are interesting in signing him to a new deal. This includes the <a href="https://fansided.com/mlb/mlb-teams/st-louis-cardinals/">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. It&#x2019;d be a welcome reunion that St. Louis fans would sign up for in a heartbeat. Yet, nothing has gotten done yet.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Albert Pujols signing with the Cardinals would be a feel-good story</h2><p>Pujols returning to the Cards really would warm so many hearts. He won three NL MVPs with the club, while also capturing two World Series titles. With that said, it&#x2019;s unclear if he&#x2019;d be open to a bench role with the squad. He could look for more playing time elsewhere.</p><p>On top of that, while it&#x2019;s expected, the official announcement of a DH in the National League is yet to be done. Once that happens, perhaps we could see the Cardinals and Pujols take things to the next level.</p><p></p><p>As things stand, Pujols is still free to sign with any team he wants. The hope across the city, however, is that Pujols and St. Louis can find a way to come to an agreement so he could potentially close out his career with the Cards.</p><p>Pujols put on a show in the Dominican Winter League. Now, he&#x2019;s ready to see a team give him another payday. Will it be the Cards? The folks who love St. Louis sure are hoping so.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="dark" data-text="3 moves Cardinals should make after missing on Max Scherzer" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/29/cardinals-rumors-free-agency-story-jansen-stroman/" data-call-to-action="Next"> <div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background:#58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/29/cardinals-rumors-free-agency-story-jansen-stroman/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span>3 moves Cardinals should make after missing on Max Scherzer </a> </div></div><p class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="undefined" data-text="3" moves cardinals should make after missing on max scherzer data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/29/cardinals-rumors-free-agency-story-jansen-stroman/" data-call-to-action="Next"> </p><div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background:#58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/29/cardinals-rumors-free-agency-story-jansen-stroman/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span>3 moves Cardinals should make after missing on Max Scherzer </a> </div><p></p> </div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>After a brief stint with the Santa Cruz Warriors, NBA veteran Jeremy Lin returns to China to join the Beijing Ducks of the Chinese Basketball Association.&#xA0;</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">At 33 years old, <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/05/24/jeremy-lin-retirement-rumors/">Jeremy Lin</a> has had quite the basketball journey, from Harvard to feverish Knicks &#x201C;Linsanity&#x201D; to the resulting seven-year journey involving six different NBA teams.</p><p>But Lin&#x2019;s basketball career is far from over, he&#x2019;s just taking his talents elsewhere. After a brief stint with the Santa Cruz Warriors, the G League affiliate for the Golden State Warriors, Lin rejoined the Chinese Basketball Association and&#xA0;<a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/china/article/3157922/former-nba-star-jeremy-lim-returns-beijing-ducks-2021-22-cba-season">signed with the Beijing Ducks</a> on Nov. 30. Like his recent Bay Area return, this will be the second stint Lin has with the Ducks, who he played with during the 2019-20 season.</p><p>&#x201C;Playing basketball in China feels at home,&#x201D; he was quoted as saying. &#x201C;Thanks all fans for the support, and I am looking forward to the second and third phase of this season.&#x201D;</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Jeremy Lin returns to play ball in China with the Beijing Ducks</h2><p>Lin has battled adversity at every point in his career, from going undrafted to leading the Knicks to a 2012 playoff appearance. Since his flash of brilliance with the Knicks, several NBA teams have attempted to glean the same production out of Lin, but no one has been successful. The longest stints Lin has had have been with the Houston Rockets and the Brooklyn Nets, each of which lasted two years. Lin did earn an NBA Championship in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors, but it was the only year he spent with the team.</p><p>Lin made history as the first Asian American to win an NBA Championship, as well as the first East Asian American and the first Harvard graduate to play in the NBA Finals. When the Raptors let Lin fall to free agency, Lin likened his situation to hitting &#x201C;<a href="https://global.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/27474938/lin-inks-pact-play-china-beijing-ducks">rock bottom</a>&#x201C;, stating that he felt like the NBA had &#x201C;kind of given up&#x201D; on him.</p><p></p><p>Before signing with the Ducks, Lin was looking to rejoin the NBA after a year with the Santa Cruz Warriors. The G-League Warriors signed Lin in January 2021 through the new <a href="https://santacruz.gleague.nba.com/news/santa-cruz-warriors-adds-nba-veteran-jeremy-lin/">NBA Veteran exception rule</a>, which &#x201C;allows teams to designate one NBA Veteran Selection to join a team&#x2019;s 10-man roster.&#x201D;</p><p>Lin played in nine games, averaging 19.8 points per game with 6.4 assists. Lin also made 50.5 percent from the field and made 42.6 percent on 3-point shots. Still, the productive performances weren&#x2019;t enough to catch the eye of any NBA team, so Lin returned to the Ducks to continue his basketball career in the CBA.</p><p>During his last season with the Ducks, Lin took the CBA by storm as he racked up awards and nominations with his skills.</p><p>Lin was nominated to the CBA All-Star Game, where he scored 41 points. During the season, he averaged 22.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists, earning him a finalist spot as the CBA Defensive Player of the Year.</p><p>Lin can still player basketball, but in the ultra-competitive U.S. market that recruits the best players from around the world, Lin might be better suited sharing his talents in a league that values his output.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="light" data-text="Former NBA star Jeremy Lin isn&#x2019;t ready to retire just yet" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/05/24/jeremy-lin-retirement-rumors/" data-call-to-action="More"> </div><p class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="undefined" data-text="Former" nba star jeremy lin isn’t ready to retire just yet data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/05/24/jeremy-lin-retirement-rumors/" data-call-to-action="More"> </p><p></p> </div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>The Texas Rangers shelled out a ton of money for Corey Seager, but was it too much? One retired player and former Ranger thinks so.</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">The Texas Rangers became one of the biggest surprises of the offseason last weekend, when they plunked down hundreds of millions to sign outfielder Kole Calhoun, starting pitcher Jon Gray, and second baseman Marcus Semien.</p><p>Then, earlier this week, they nabbed shortstop Corey Seager. His deal is the biggest of the bunch: 10 years, $325M.</p><p>That&#x2019;s a lot of money for any player, but especially one who has struggled to stay healthy throughout his career, and only played 95 games in 2021.</p><p></p><h2 class="speakable-content">Former Texas Ranger Will Middlebrooks thinks they&#x2019;re overpaying Corey Seager</h2><p><a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/middlwi01.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" ref="nofollow">Will Middlebrooks</a>, who won a World Series with the Red Sox before joining his hometown Rangers in 2017, weighed in on Seager&#x2019;s blockbuster deal earlier this week. Rangers fans may remember him from his pair of <a href="https://www.masslive.com/redsox/2017/09/will_middlebrooks_former_bosto.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pinch-hit triples</a> during a doubleheader back in 2017.</p><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love Seager and I also love seeing guys get paid&#x2026; but, I feel like that was a major over pay. Am I crazy for feeling that way?</p><p>&#x2014; Will Middlebrooks (@middlebrooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/middlebrooks/status/1465506609908617222?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><p>As Middlebrooks explicitly states, he, like most athletes, is happy to see players get paid, so this clearly isn&#x2019;t a personal attack. Each MLB team is valued at over a billion dollars, their owners are rich, and the players whose talents make the owners rich deserve to be compensated for their work.</p><p>But if Seager isn&#x2019;t healthy enough to play consistently, he will be grossly overcompensated. That is what concerns Middlebrooks and many other skeptics.</p><p>Over seven big-league seasons, Seager has played 636 total games. He&#x2019;s only played 100+ games three times in his career, most recently in 2019. You could argue that his 52 games in the 60-game 2020 season would be equivalent to 139 games in a full season, but that assumes Seager remained healthy for the duration.</p><div class="embed "><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That&#x2019;s a helluva gamble</p><p>&#x2014; Will Middlebrooks (@middlebrooks) <a href="https://twitter.com/middlebrooks/status/1465693643130355718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></div><h2>Can Corey Seager stay healthy to live up to his contract with the Rangers?</h2><p>Many baseball fans agree with Middlebrooks, citing Seager&#x2019;s significant injury history, and predicting that the Rangers will continue to be mediocre, even after committing to nearly half a billion in contracts this week. Several accounts replied that Seager will be traded in a few years when the team&#x2019;s struggles continue and the contract becomes a drag, a repeat of what happened with Alex Rodriguez.</p><p>The issue of Seager living up to the dollar amount is timely. In a matter of hours, MLB will enter a lockout, in large part because teams are so stingy about paying non-superstar players. There is a vast and ever-widening gap between the contracts players like Seager, Bryce Harper, and Max Scherzer received and what the everyman players are paid. Team owners are happy to shell out for the stars, but they do so while holding down the rest of the players by manipulating service time and fighting for every dollar in arbitration.</p><p>Seager is a former NL Rookie of the Year, a two-time All-Star and Silver Slugger, NLCS and World Series MVP, and has a 2020 World Series ring. But if he can&#x2019;t stay healthy enough to be an everyday player in Texas, Middlebrooks will be correct: Seager will be overpaid.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="dark" data-text="Why Dodgers couldn&#x2019;t hang on to Corey Seager revealed" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/dodger-corey-seager-leaving-explained/" data-call-to-action="Next"> <div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background:#58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/dodger-corey-seager-leaving-explained/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span>Why Dodgers couldn&#x2019;t hang on to Corey Seager revealed </a> </div></div><p class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="undefined" data-text="Why" dodgers couldn’t hang on to corey seager revealed data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/dodger-corey-seager-leaving-explained/" data-call-to-action="Next"> </p><div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background:#58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/dodger-corey-seager-leaving-explained/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span>Why Dodgers couldn&#x2019;t hang on to Corey Seager revealed </a> </div><p></p> </div>]]></content:encoded>

The star wide receiver has missed back-to-back games after testing positive for COVID. Dallas is 0-2 with Cooper watching from home.</p><p>Earlier this week, it was revealed that Cooper was still feeling ill and his status for the Thursday Night Football game <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/12/01/cowboys-saints-week-13-2021-bold-predictions/">against the New Orleans Saints</a> was clear as mud.

Dallas is the favorite leading into things and their odds are only going to get stronger with Cooper back in the fold for the offense.</p><p>On the season, Cooper has hauled in 44 receptions for 585 yards and five touchdowns.

He&#x2019;s a two-time Gold Glove winner and a former All-Star in six years of service in Major League Baseball. He&#x2019;s known for his power with 142 home runs and a slug of .511. If the Braves are looking for cheaper than Freeman but a smaller drop-off in production, Olson would be a prime target.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Braves: Freddie Freeman headed elsewhere?</h2><p>The Braves and Freeman have been talking about an extension for some time now, but nothing has come of it. He has been public about wanting to stay in Atlanta for his whole career, but wants to be paid what he believes is fair and deserving. Liberty Media owns the Atlanta Braves, and would definitely be labeled as a &#x201C;profit first&#x201D; ownership group, despite the recent successes of the World Champion ball club. Being public with their interest in Olson could be a play to lower Freeman&#x2019;s asking price, but they could also legitimately be preparing to move on.</p><p>Freeman&#x2019;s market seems to be heating up. The New York Yankees have been mentioned as an interested team, but reports are numbers are matching that of the Braves, and Freeman would want more than that to head to the Bronx. <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/dodger-corey-seager-leaving-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">After missing out on re-signing Corey Seager,</a> the Los Angeles Dodgers could be suitors for Freeman, and appear to be ready to back up a Brinks truck for him. It&#x2019;s worth noting that both Freeman and his wife are from Southern California and may want to return home.</p><p>It&#x2019;s likely a Freeman deal would come after the new CBA is sorted out, but time will tell if he and the Braves can organize a happy resolution.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="dark" data-text="Freddie Freeman&#x2019;s exact contract demands make Braves look even worse" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/freddie-freeman-rumors-braves-contract-demands/" data-call-to-action="Next"> <div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background:#58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/freddie-freeman-rumors-braves-contract-demands/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span>Freddie Freeman&#x2019;s exact contract demands make Braves look even worse </a> </div></div><p class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="undefined" data-text="Freddie" freeman’s exact contract demands make braves look even worse data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/freddie-freeman-rumors-braves-contract-demands/" data-call-to-action="Next"> </p><div class="story-link-next"> <a class="story-link-next-btn" style="background:#58595b" data-track="shortcode" data-track-action="story-link-next-shortcode" href="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/freddie-freeman-rumors-braves-contract-demands/"> <span class="call_to_action">Next:</span>Freddie Freeman&#x2019;s exact contract demands make Braves look even worse </a> </div><p></p> </div>]]></content:encoded>

The case demonstrated the seriousness of the new restrictions, but it didn&#x2019;t prevent the Bulls and Heat from engaging in tampering earlier this year.</p><p></p><p>What raised red flags was the swiftness with which the complex sign-and-trade deals were conducted between the New Orleans Pelicans and Chicago Bulls and the Toronto Raptors and Miami Heat, respectively. Usually, such deals can take weeks or even months to negotiate and iron out, but these deals were finalized within hours. Signing players to massive contracts, then trading them immediately, allows teams to circumvent salary cap restrictions while accumulating expensive talent.</p><p>The Pelicans signed Ball for four years and $85 million, then traded him to Chicago. The Bulls then signed Garrett Temple to a three-year, $15.5 million deal, making the deal a two-way sign-and-trade. New Orleans also nabbed Tom&#xE1;&#x161; Satoransk&#xFD;, a 2024 second-round pick and a little cap space.</p><p>The Heat exercised their&#xA0;$19.5 million option for Goran Dragi&#x107;&#xA0;two days before the negotiating period. Then, Dragi&#x107; was sent to the Raptors, along with Precious Achiuwa. Toronto signed Lowry to a three-year, $85 million pact before sending him to Miami.</p><p>While losing a second-round pick is not ideal, the offending teams each faced <a href="https://fansided.com/2021/08/07/nba-investigating-heat-bulls-tampering-kyle-lowry-lonzo-ball-deals/">a maximum penalty of $10 million dollars</a>. For Lonzo Ball and Kyle Lowry, losing a second-round pick might be worth the risk &#x2014; but the next team could be made an example of and experience that maximum fine.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="light" data-text="Nikola Jokic flames Miami Heat by playing Serbian national anthem post-victory" data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/nikola-jokic-flames-miami-heat-playing-serbian-national-anthem-post-victory/" data-call-to-action="Must Read"> </div><p class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-config="undefined" data-text="Nikola" jokic flames miami heat by playing serbian national anthem post-victory data-url="https://fansided.com/2021/11/30/nikola-jokic-flames-miami-heat-playing-serbian-national-anthem-post-victory/" data-call-to-action="Must" read> </p><p></p> </div>]]></content:encoded>

Since signing with Bellator, Justino has finished all three of her opponents. Justino will have to bring her best to get another finish because Kavanagh is as tough as they come. With the opportunity of a lifetime for Kavanagh, you can ensure she will do whatever it takes to win.</p><p>In the co-headliner, Tyrell Fortune and Linton Vassell have the opportunity to climb up the heavyweight rankings. Both fighters come in on a winning streak with the hopes of building off their momentum.</p><p>Bellator 271 also features several other prospects, including Aaron Pico, Justin Gonzales, Steve Mowry, Cody Law, Valerie Loureda, and Mahmoud Fawzy Sebie. Unfortunately, one bout was scratched because Shane O&#x2019;Shea never weighed in. Now that the weigh-in is complete, you can check out the official results below.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">Weigh-in results for&#xA0;Bellator 271: Cris Cyborg vs. Sinead Kavanagh</h2><h3>Main Card (7 p.m. ET / 10 p.m. PT, YouTube)</h3><ul><li>Cris Cyborg (145) vs. Sinead Kavanagh (145)</li><li>Tyrell Fortune (253.8) vs. Linton Vassell (239.2)</li><li>Aaron Pico (145.4) vs. Justin Gonzales (145.6)</li><li>Arlene Blencowe (145.8) vs. Pam Sorenson (146)</li><li>Steve Mowry (249.6) vs. Rakim Cleveland (249.6)</li></ul><h3>Preliminary Card (10 p.m. ET / 1 a.m. PT, Showtime)</h3><ul><li>Bruna Ellen (125.6) vs. Desiree Yanez (125.4)</li><li>Roman Faraldo (171) vs. Robert Turnquest (170.8)</li><li>Cody Law (145.4) vs. Colton Hamm (145.8)</li><li>Valerie Loureda (127.6) vs. Taylor Turner (127.2) &#x2013; <em>128 pound catchweight</em></li><li>Jordan Newman (187.6) vs. Shane O&#x2019;Shea (*)</li><li>Waldo Cortes-Acosta (256.6) vs. Mo DeReese (255)</li><li>Mahmoud Fawzy Sebie (170.8) vs. Ethan Hughes (170.8)</li></ul><p>*O&#x2019;Shea never weighed in.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div> <p class="speakable-content"><em><strong>With enticing free agent Odell Beckham Jr. now signing to NFC West rival the Los Angeles Rams, the Seattle Seahawks need to make moves to combat L.A.</strong></em></p><p class="speakable-content">When the <a href="https://fansided.com/nfl/teams/seattle-seahawks/">Los Angeles Rams</a> stole away Odell Beckham Jr. from the league, the hope of an uplifted offense went with him.</p><p>That&#x2019;s true for several teams who were reportedly courting the eight-year veteran, including the Seattle Seahawks, whose roster gets real thin after D.K. Metcalf and Tyler Lockett.</p><p>Beyond their starting three wideouts, which include Metcalf, Lockett and Freddie Swain, the Seahawks only have one healthy wide receiver on their roster: Penny Hart.</p><p></p><p>Dee Eskridge and John Ursua are on IR, making their wide receiver situation perilous should the team sustain even one more injury.</p><p>With the trade deadline passing on Nov. 2, all the Seahawks can do is add available players in free agency or upgrade players from their practice squad.</p><p>Here are three possible moves the Seahawks can make to bolster their offense and rival the Rams.</p><h2 class="speakable-content">3. Sign Dez Bryant</h2><p>After an impressive comeback season with the Baltimore Ravens in 2020, Dez Bryant remains an <a href="https://www.profootballnetwork.com/top-2021-nfl-free-agents-each-position/">NFL free agent in 2021</a>.</p><p>It remains unclear what Bryant&#x2019;s exact situation is at the moment aside from investing in NFTs, but as of February of this year, Bryant said <a href="https://www.nj.com/giants/2021/02/nfl-rumors-ex-cowboys-wr-dez-bryant-has-no-plans-to-retire-after-comeback-with-ravens.html#:~:text=Giants-,NFL%20rumors%3A%20Ex%2DCowboys%20WR%20Dez%20Bryant%20has%20no%20plans,retire%20after%20comeback%20with%20Ravens&amp;text=The%20Dez%20Bryant%20comeback%20tour,missing%20the%20previous%20two%20seasons.">he has no plans to retire</a>. If available, the Seahawks could work out the 33-year-old veteran who made his name as a longtime Dallas Cowboy.</p><p>At the very least, the Seahawks could work out Bryant to see what they&#x2019;re working with and determine whether or not he&#x2019;s a fit for their offense.</p><h2>2. Sign Golden Tate</h2><p>It&#x2019;s easy to make a case for Golden Tate, who began his career with the Seattle Seahawks and won a ring with the team in 2013.</p><p>Tate, who is also 33, remains an available free agent like Bryant. As of June 2021, Tate discussed <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/golden-tate-free-agent-wr-wish-list-titans-colts-rams#:~:text=%EF%BB%BFGolden%20Tate%EF%BB%BF%20remains,388%20yards%20and%20two%20TDs.">which teams he&#x2019;d like to sign with</a>.</p><p>But Tate was also on an NFL team last season, so barring any injury or decline in athleticism, his skill set could be greatly utilized on the Seahawks a decade after he first joined the team.</p><p>Tate can be signed for depth, or to compliment Lockett and Metcalf on the field.</p><h2>1. Upgrade Cody Thompson</h2><p>If the Seahawks want to keep things in-house, they could always upgrade a player from the practice squad. They did it earlier this year when they signed Penny Hart from the practice squad to the 53-man roster, and Hart is the only backup wide receiver on the roster who isn&#x2019;t on IR.</p><p>While Thompson has never made an active NFL roster, he has been on a practice squad since he joined the league in 2019. Thompson began with the Chiefs, then the Bengals, before finishing his rookie season with the Seahawks.</p><p>Thompson put together &#x201C;<a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/seahawks/gm-report/seahawks-90-man-roster-primer-cody-thompson">an impressive training camp last July</a>&#x201C;, but high competition for few wide receiver spots has&#xA0; kept Thompson off the roster.</p><p>But if Ursua and Eskridge are unable to join this season, it may be time for Seattle to turn back to their practice squad and upgrade Thompson.</p><div class="fs-shortcode" data-type="StoryLink" data-theme="light" data-text="D.K.

Though the Titans came out victorious, and got the most crucial season sweep of Indianapolis, it came at a price. Without their best player going forward, Tennessee is not a threat to come out of the AFC this year.
