Michael Strahan<\/h3>\n<p>Michael Strahan has made a pretty good career for himself in his post-football life, but nothing will top what he did on the field for the Giants over a 15 year span.<\/p>\n<p>Strahan had his best years at the beginning of the 2000s. He had 9.5 sacks in 2000, and then had the greatest season for an edge rusher in NFL history. He put up an NFL record 22.5 sacks in 2001, a mark that has still yet to be topped. He also led the NFL with 24 tackles for loss that season. He was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl and named First-team All-Pro for the third time, while also winning Defensive Player of the Year.<\/p>\n<p>Strahan was a Pro Bowler once again in 2002 after recording 11 sacks, and then had another amazing year in 2003. He recorded 18.5 sacks and was again named All-Pro. Strahan was without a ring going into the 2007 season, and that finally changed. The Giants upset the undefeated Patriots in Super Bowl XLII in large part because of the pressure that Strahan and the Giants front seven put on Tom Brady. He went out as a Super Bowl champion and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>28.

Shaun Alexander<\/h3>\n<p>Shaun Alexander may not have had the longevity of other great running backs that will be on this list, but for a five year span, he was unstoppable.<\/p>\n<p>He led the NFL in rushing touchdowns in 2001 with 14. He also ran for over 1,300 yards that season on 309 carries. He had another good year in 2002, this time rushing for 16 touchdowns and just under 1,200 yards.<\/p>\n<p>Alexander finally earned his first Pro Bowl appearance in 2003. He had over 1,400 yards on the ground and 14 touchdowns. He continued his strong work in 2004, racking up nearly 1,700 yards and 16 touchdowns.<\/p>\n<p>Alexander&rsquo;s 2005 season was one of the best by a running back in NFL history. He led the NFL with 1,880 yards and 27 touchdowns, an NFL record at the time. He also carried the ball an astonishing 370 times, as the Seahawks made it to the Super Bowl. Alexander was named league MVP for his record-breaking season.<\/p>\n<p>His production would slow down after the 2005 season, but the Seahawks rode Alexander for five seasons, and he constantly delivered. He retired with 100 rushing touchdowns and over 9,400 yards rushing for his career.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>27.

Brian Urlacher<\/h3>\n<p>Doesn&rsquo;t the name &ldquo;Brian Urlacher&rdquo; just sound like the name of a great NFL linebacker that would knock your shoes off? Urlacher carried on the tradition of great Bears defenders, and was the ultimate Monster of the Midway in the 2000s.<\/p>\n<p>He was drafted by Chicago in 2000 and he made the Pro Bowl as a rookie. In 2001, he was named First-Team All-Pro after recording 118 tackles and intercepting three passes. He also returned a fumble for a touchdown that season. His instincts from playing safety in college served him well at the NFL level, as he intercepted 22 passes in his career.<\/p>\n<p>Urlacher was named All-Pro once again in 2002. He had 153 tackles that season, and continued to get better with time. In 2005, he won Defensive Player of the Year as the Bears fielded one of the best defenses in football, of which Urlacher was the catalyst.<\/p>\n<p>He finished his career as an eight-time Pro Bowler and four-time All-Pro. In an era where the Bears never had great offenses, they relied on their defense to win them games. Urlacher helped get the Bear to multiple NFC Championship Games, as well as an appearance in Super Bowl XLI.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>26.

Ben Roethlisberger<\/h3>\n<p>The Steelers spent two decades looking for a franchise quarterback in the post-Terry Bradshaw era. After going through the likes of Bubby Brister and Kordell Stewart and Tommy Maddox, they drafted the 6-foot-5, 240 pound quarterback out of Miami University that would change their franchise.<\/p>\n<p>Roethlisberger started his first game in Week 3 of 2004 after a Maddox injury, and the Steelers just kept winning. Pittsburgh went 13-0 with Roethlisberger as the starter and made it to the AFC Championship Game before losing to the eventual Super Bowl Champion Patriots.<\/p>\n<p>The Steelers didn&rsquo;t take long to get back to the Conference Championship Game, as they ran the table as a No. 6 seed in 2005 to win the Super Bowl, making Roethlisberger the youngest quarterback to win a ring at age 23.<\/p>\n<p>Although the Steelers won two Super Bowls in Roethlisberger&rsquo;s first five seasons, his best years came in the 2010s. Ben led the NFl in passing yards for the first time in 2014, throwing for 4,952 yards along with 32 touchdowns to just nine interceptions. He led the league in passing once again in 2018, eclipsing 5,000 yards for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>There was a time where Ben seemed a little underrated when compared to Brady and Manning, but he has established a legacy for himself as one of the toughest quarterbacks in history, and one of the best gunslingers of all time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>25.

Richard Sherman<\/h3>\n<p>The Legion of Boom was one of the best defenses ever constructed, and RIchard Sherman was the best player on that defense.<\/p>\n<p>As a fifth round pick in 2011, Sherman had four interceptions as a rookie- that would be a sign of things to come in Seattle. He was named All-pro in his second year, picking off eight passes, and repeated as an All-Pro the following year with eight interceptions, as well.<\/p>\n<p>The Seahawks would go on to win the Super Bowl in 2013, destroying the Broncos 43-8 off the strength of their defense. Sherman would continue his impressive reign in Seattle through 2018, where he left for division-rival San Francisco. He was a Pro Bowler for the 49ers in 2019 and helped lead the Niners to a Super Bowl appearance.<\/p>\n<p>Sherman is one of the smartest defenders of the last 20 years. His ability to read plays and attack the ball helped the Seahawks make it to consecutive Super Bowls, as well as being a veteran presence on the 49ers team that nearly beat Kansas City in 2020. Now residing in Tampa Bay, he hopes to add another Super Bowl to his resume before his career is over.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>24.

Julio Jones<\/h3>\n<p>If the Falcons held on to beat the Patriots in the Super Bowl, we would be talking about Julio Jones&#8217; sideline catch as one of the greatest plays in NFL history. That game sums up Jones&rsquo; career in Atlanta pretty well, actually- he did so much, but it still wasn&rsquo;t enough.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless of Atlanta&rsquo;s shortcomings, Jones has been consistently great. He made his first Pro Bowl in 2012, catching 79 passes for just under 1,200 yards and 10 touchdowns. He was injured for most of 2013, but rebounded with his second Pro Bowl selection in 2014 with 104 receptions and over 1,500 yards.<\/p>\n<p>Jones&rsquo; 2015 season was one of the best for a receiver in history. He caught 136 passes for 1,871 yards and eight touchdowns, earning All-Pro honors for the first time. He missed two games in 2016, but still did enough to earn his second straight All-Pro selection.<\/p>\n<p>Jones was traded to the Titans ahead of the 2021 season. Injuries have once again plagued him, but when Tennessee is completely healthy, their offensive balance is as good as any team in the league. At age 32, the clock is ticking on Jones winning a Super Bowl. We&rsquo;ll find out if he can do it with the Titans.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>23.

Whether it was opening up holes for Shaun Alexander in his historic MVP season in 2005, or protecting the blind side of Matt Hasselback, Jones was constantly reliable, and rarely missed any time with injury.<\/p>\n<p>He made his second Pro Bowl in 2001, as well as being named First-Team All-Pro for the first time. From 2001-08, he wouldn&rsquo;t miss a Pro Bowl, and would be named an All-Pro four times. The Seahawks made it to the Super Bowl in the 2005 season off the strength of Alexander&rsquo;s tremendous season on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>Jones opened up outside running lanes for the 2005 MVP, and helped Hasselback with a clean pocket more often than not. While Seattle didn&rsquo;t win, it was the first time they had found real success in their franchise&rsquo;s history. Their run in the 2000s of constant playoff appearances may not have happened if Jones wasn&rsquo;t anchoring the line.<\/p>\n<p>He retired after the 2008 season as a nine-time Pro Bowl selection and was named All-Pro on four occasions. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2014, and is one of the best lineman of his era.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>22.

Marvin Harrison<\/h3>\n<p>The Indianapolis Colts revolutionized the modern NFL offense with their passing attack, and Marvin Harrison was Peyton manning;s favorite target during that time.<\/p>\n<p>Harrison made seven consecutive Pro Bowls from 2000-06. He led the NFL in receptions with 102 in 2000 to go along with over 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns. In 2002, he had one of the best seasons for a wide receiver of all time. He caught 143 passes, an NFL record at the time, and also led the NFL with 1,722 receiving yards. It is one of the handful of best seasons for a receiver of all time.<\/p>\n<p>Harrison had 1,000 yards every season from 2000-06, and was named All-Pro for the final time in that 2006 season where the Colts finally got over the hump and won the Super Bowl. He caught 95 passes for over 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns en route to the Colts defeating the Bears in Super Bowl XLI in the pouring rain.<\/p>\n<p>Harrison is one of the best wide receivers of all time, and also had some of the best hands in NFL history.

Ever since Cleveland drafted him in 2007, he was one of the best left tackles in the game. He made the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 2007, and repeated as a Pro Bowler in 2008.<\/p>\n<p>From 2009-11, he made three consecutive All-Pro teams. It didn&rsquo;t matter what quarterback was under center, Thomas made a living out of making sure no one touched them. He made three more All-Pro teams from 2013-15, and didn&rsquo;t miss a snap in his career until an injury in 2017 caused him to miss nine games.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas retired following the 2017 season when the Browns went winless. He was never part of a playoff team, and it&rsquo;s a shame because if he stuck around for a couple more seasons, he would have been a member of the Browns team that finally made the playoffs. Regardless of the bad teams he had around him, Thomas was incredibly consistent and one of the best blockers in the game for a decade.<\/p>\n<p>Thomas is a sure-fire Hall of Famer when the time comes, and was one of the few beacons of light in one of the worst eras of football in Browns history.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>20.

Luke Kuechly<\/h3>\n<p>It really is a shame that injuries robbed us of watching Luke Kuechly have a longer career. In terms of a football IQ standpoint, you could argue that no one was smarter on the field when Kuechly was playing.<\/p>\n<p>Kuechly led the NFL in tackles as a rookie with 164 and was named Defensive Rookie of the Year. For some reason or another, he wasn&rsquo;t named All-Pro, or even chosen to go to the Pro Bowl. Regardless, his best was yet to come. In 2013 He had 156 tackles and four interceptions and was named Defensive Player of the Year.<\/p>\n<p>He once again led the NFL in tackles in 2014 with 153, as well as batting down 12 passes. He would go on to be an All-Pro again in 2015, racking up 118 tackles and four interceptions in 13 games.<\/p>\n<p>Kuechly would add two more All-Pro selections to his list of accolades before retiring after the 2019 season. He sustained several concussions throughout his career, and decided it was best for him and his family to step away from football. He retired as a seven-time Pro Bowler and a five-time All-Pro selection, as well as being named a member of the 2010s All-Decade Team. He is one of the best, and smartest, defenders of his generation.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>19.

Von Miller<\/h3>\n<p>Von Miller has been a force to be reckoned with ever since he was a rookie in 2011. He was a Pro Bowler that season after recording 11.5 sacks, and parlayed that success into a 2012 season that saw him become an All-pro.<\/p>\n<p>Miller had 18.5 sacks in 2012 and quickly became one of the best edge rushers in the NFL. He missed seven games in &#8217;13, but rebounded in &#8217;14 with 14 sacks and getting back to the Pro Bowl. He made consecutive All-Pro selections in 2015 and &#8217;16, getting to the quarterback a combined 24.5 times in that span. He helped the Broncos defeat the Panthers in Super Bowl 50, giving Denver their first Championship since 1998.<\/p>\n<p>Now a member of the Rams, Miller has a chance to add a second Super Bowl to his list of accolades. Sharing the field with Jalen Ramsey definitely makes Los Angeles a threat. If they can start finding that chemistry on both sides of the ball, there is no doubt that the Rams can end the 2021 season lifting the Lombardi.<\/p>\n<p>Miller currently sits at 110.5 sacks in his career, and will one day have a bust in Canton, OH.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>18.

Charles Woodson<\/h3>\n<p>How Charles Woodson spent 18 years in the NFL as a defensive back and didn&rsquo;t ever look bad doing it was the work of a higher power. Whether it was in Oakland or Green Bay, the man never lost a step.<\/p>\n<p>Woodson began the century with consecutive Pro Bowl appearances with the Raiders in 2000 and 2001. Injuries derailed multiple seasons through the early 2000s, and in 20006, he became a Green Bay Packer. In his first season with Green Bay, Woodson intercepted eight passes and somehow got snubbed from the Pro Bowl.<\/p>\n<p>From 2008-11, though, he was one of the best defensive players in football. He intercepted seven passes in 2008, and led the NFL with nine picks in 2009, being named All-Pro for the first time in his career.<\/p>\n<p>In 2010, Woodson helped the Packers win the Super Bowl. He was once again named All-Pro in &#8217;11, leading the NFL with seven interceptions. He finished his career with the team that drafted him, as he went back to Oakland in 2013. He made the switch from cornerback to safety, intercepting five passes in 2015, and being named a Pro Bowler in his final season.<\/p>\n<p>Woodson retired with 65 interceptions and is widely regarded as one of the best defensive backs of all time. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>17.

Larry Fitzgerald<\/h3>\n<p>There were several receivers who made their mark in the 2000s. There were plenty of receivers who dominated the 2010s- Larry Fitzgerald did both.<\/p>\n<p>Fitzgerald made four Pro Bowl teams in the 2000s, and seven in the 2010s. He led the NFl in receptions in his second year in 2005, catching 103 passes for over 1,400 yards and 10 touchdowns. In &#8217;08, Fitzgerald had an incredible regular season, but his postseason was the stuff of legend.<\/p>\n<p>He was named First-Team All-pro for his 96 catches and leading the NFL with 12 touchdown receptions, but he took it to a whole other gear in the postseason. He caught 30 passes for over 500 yards and seven touchdowns in the Cardinals four playoff games. If not for last second heroics by Ben Roehtlisberger and Santonio Holmes, Fitzgerald would have dragged the Cardinals to a Super Bowl win.<\/p>\n<p>Eight years later in 2016, Fitzgerald was still at the top of his game. He led the NFL with 107 catches, one year after putting up 109. He seemed to get better with age, and currently sits at No. 2 all time in receiving yards.

Julius Peppers<\/h3>\n<p>There have been a lot of great edge rushers since the turn of the century, but from 2002-18, Julius Peppers was the man. He kicked off his career with 12 sacks as a rookie, winning the 2002 Defensive Rookie of the Year.<\/p>\n<p>From 2004-06, he made three straight Pro Bowls and had at least 10 sacks in each season. In 2006, he had 13 sacks and led the NFL with 18 tackles for loss. He continued his success after a down year in 2007.<\/p>\n<p>He totaled a career-high 14.5 sacks in 2008, and followed it up with 10.5 sacks in 2009. Peppers left for Chicago in 2010, where he was named First-Team All-Pro for the third time in his career. He had eight sacks, to go along with three forced fumbles, nine pass deflections, 11 tackles for loss, and two interceptions. He did everything for the Bears that season, and was their best defender on a loaded defensive unit.<\/p>\n<p>Peppers returned to Carolina before his career was over, and had 11 sacks in 2017 with the team that drafted him. He retired following the 2018 season with 159.5 career sacks and 175 tackles for loss.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>15.

Ed Reed<\/h3>\n<p>The best ball hawk in NFL history, Ed Reed was elite at reading the quarterback&#8217;s eyes, and making them pay for testing him.<\/p>\n<p>Here is a great story about Reed. The Ravens were scheduled to play the Colts one season. Reed knew that Peyton Manning would be studying Reed&rsquo;s film, so Reed purposely didn&rsquo;t make certain reads on defense so Manning wouldn&rsquo;t expect it when the two teams played. Reed ended up intercepting Manning that game. That was just next-level intellect that he had.<\/p>\n<p>Reed led the NFL in interceptions three times. He had nine interceptions in 2004, as well as 358 interception return yards, which led the league. He was named First-Team All-Pro and won the Defensive Player of the Year. Reed made three consecutive All-Pro teams from 2006-08, and once again led the NFL with nine interceptions in 2008. His final All-Pro selection came in 2010, where he once again led the NFL in interceptions with eight.<\/p>\n<p>Reed was a threat in the defensive backfield for over a decade. He returned seven interceptions for touchdowns, and was also a threat in the return game, as well. He is the best ball hawk in modern NFL history, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2019.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>14.

Troy Polamalu<\/h3>\n<p>Troy Polamalu was a unicorn on the football field. We had never seen anyone quite like him. He was a ball hawk that made some of the most mind-boggling interceptions, and his instincts were unmatched on the back end. Whether he was intercepting passes or flying over the line of scrimmage to make a sack, Polamalu was a swiss army knife for the Steelers for over a decade.<\/p>\n<p>He made his first Pro Bowl in his second season in 2004. The Steelers fielded the best defense in the NFL that season, going 15-1 and making it to the AFC Championship Game. The USC product picked off five passes that season, returning one for a touchdown. Polamalu repeated as a Pro Bowler in 2005, as well as being named First-Team All-Pro, and was one of the biggest contributors to the Steelers&rsquo; 2005 Super Bowl winning team.<\/p>\n<p>Polamalu&rsquo;s best season came in 2010. He intercepted seven passes and was named Defensive Player of the Year. He would repeat as an All-Pro in &#8217;11, and he made his final Pro Bowl appearance in &#8217;13. He retired as an eight-time Pro Bowl selection and a four-time All-Pro. He helped the Steelers win two Super Bowls, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2021 as part of the class of 2020.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>13.

Terrell Owens<\/h3>\n<p>No matter what city T.O. called home, he always put on a show. He started the 2000s with San Francisco, where he was named First-Team All-Pro from 200-02. He led the NFL in touchdown receptions in both 2001 (16) and 2002 (13).<\/p>\n<p>After the 2003 season, Owens was traded to the Eagles, where he continued his historic success. He was once again made All-Pro, pulling in 77 passes for 1,200 yards and 14 touchdowns and helped Philadelphia make it to the Super Bowl. He had a falling out with the Eagles, and in 2006, he signed with the division-rival Cowboys.<\/p>\n<p>Owens led the NFL in touchdowns once again in his first season in Dallas, and in 2007, he was named All-Pro for the fifth time. He had two one year stays in Buffalo and Cincinnati, respectively, before retiring in 2011 after attempting to make the Seahawks roster in the preseason.<\/p>\n<p>Whether he was dancing with cheerleaders after scoring a touchdown, or holding a workout press conference in his driveway, Owens was obviously a polarizing figure. That said, he is one of the five best receivers in league history. He was a six-time Pro Bowler, a five-time All-pro and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>12.

Antonio Brown<\/h3>\n<p>There were several great receivers that defined the 2010s- Antonio Brown outshined all of them. The six year stretch he put together from 2013-18 is one of the best, if not the best, in NFL history for a receiver.<\/p>\n<p>He had six straight years of at least 100 receptions, leading the NFL in that category in 2014 and &#8217;15. His 2014 season is one of the best for a receiver in league history. Along with leading the NFL with 129 catches, he also led the league with 1,698 yards. He followed that up with a better season in 2015. He had 136 catches and 1,834 yards that season.<\/p>\n<p>Brown would lead the NFL in yards once more in &#8217;17 with 1,533, and in 2018, his 18 receiving touchdowns were the most in the league.<\/p>\n<p>Things went south after 2018 for Brown, but he helped the Buccaneers win a Super Bowl in 2020, and is still a valuable member to their receiving unit. He may have to wait to get in the Hall of Fame based on off-field issues, but in terms of his play, he is one of the greatest receivers of all time.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>11.

Darrelle Revis<\/h3>\n<p>Let us say a quick prayer for every receiver who was sent to the dark realms of Revis Island. Revis was the best cornerback of his generation, and his impact in New York was immediate.<\/p>\n<p>Drafted in 2007 out of Pittsburgh by the Jets, Revis intercepted three passes in his rookie season, and was named a Pro Bowler in his second season in 2008. He intercepted five passes that year, returning one for a touchdown.<\/p>\n<p>From 2009-11, Revis made three consecutive All-Pro teams. He led the NFL with 31 pass deflections in 2009 and he intercepted six passes. That year, he held the likes of Andre Johnson, Steve Smith, Chad Ochocinco, and Randy Moss under 35 yards receiving. Revis continued his dominance in 2010. He was named All-pro without recording an interception- that tells you just how much of a shutdown cornerback he was.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to the 2013 season, Revis was traded to the Buccaneers, where he was once again named a Pro Bowler. In 2014, he went to New England and helped the Patriots win the Super Bowl, making his fourth All-Pro team. Revis was the definition of a lockdown cornerback. He consistently kept the game&rsquo;s best receivers in check, and made Revis Island one of the most dreaded places for opposing offenses to visit.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>10.

Watt<\/h3>\n<p>The 21st century has given us a lot of great defenders, and Watt is easily one of the best. In just his second year in the league in 2012, Watt racked up 20.5 sacks and was named First-Team All-Pro, winning his first Defensive Player of the Year Award. He would be named All-Pro each year from 2012-15 as he put up amazing seasons one after the other.<\/p>\n<p>Watt once again recorded 20.5 sacks in 2014 and was named Defensive Player of the Year for a second time. He led the NFL in sacks in 2015 with 17.5 and won his third Defensive Player of the Year Award in four seasons.<\/p>\n<p>Injuries played a big part in his lack of production in the mid-2010s, but Watt is arguably the best defender of the last decade. Whether he is sacking the quarterback or knocking down passes at the line of scrimmage, he is the definition of disruptive. Now with the Arizona Cardinals, Watt is looking to win the first Super Bowl of his storied career. Regardless if he gets a ring or not, he will be a Hall of Famer when his career is all said and done.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>9.

Aaron Donald<\/h3>\n<p>Aaron Donald is arguably the most dominant interior defensive lineman in the history of football. Since being drafted in 2014, he has never missed a Pro Bowl, and has been an All-Pro every year except his rookie season.<\/p>\n<p>He had nine sacks as a rookie with the Rams, and immediately built off that in 2015. He totaled 11 sacks along with 69 tackles, 22 of which were tackles for loss. Donald won his first Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2017. He had 11 sacks along with five forced fumbles.<\/p>\n<p>2018 was when Donald really became this unblockable presence. He led the NFL with 20.5 sacks, as well as 25 tackles for loss. He was once again named Defensive Player of the Year. He won the award for a third time in 2020 with 13.5 sacks, 14 tackles for loss, and four forced fumbles. Donald still has a long career ahead of him.<\/p>\n<p>He is only 30 and is still playing at an elite level every single week.

Adrian Peterson<\/h3>\n<p>From year one, Peterson was the best running back in football. He was named a Pro Bowler as a rookie, rushing for over 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns with the Vikings.<\/p>\n<p>He broke the single-game rushing record against the Chargers that season, rushing for 296 yards. In 2008, Peterson was named First-Team All-Pro for the first time. He led the NFL in rushing yards with 1,760 to go along with 10 touchdowns. He repeated as an All-Pro in 2009, leading the NFL with 18 touchdowns on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>2012 was Peterson&rsquo;s masterpiece. Coming off a year in which he suffered a season-ending leg injury, Peterson ran for 2,097 yards, the second most in NFL history. He was named NFL MVP, as well as the Offensive Player of the Year and Comeback Player of the Year.<\/p>\n<p>He led the NFL in rushing one more time with the Vikings in 2015, accumulating 1,485 yards on the ground. He also led the league with 11 rushing touchdowns.<\/p>\n<p>Peterson&rsquo;s reign in Minnesota is one of the best ever for a running back. While his best years are behind him, there were few like him in the history of the NFL when he was at the top of his game. He will easily be a first ballot Hall of Famer when his time comes.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>7.

He didn&rsquo;t have a big arm, but he was an offensive maestro. The crowd was his audience, the field was his stage, and he spent 20 seasons making beautiful music.<\/p>\n<p>Brees was drafted in the second round by the Chargers in 2001 out of Purdue. He had mild success in San Diego, becoming a Pro Bowler in 2004. In 2005, Brees suffered a shoulder injury that some feared would be career ending. The Chargers drafted Phillip Rivers the year before, and were confident enough in the young quarterback to let Brees leave via free agency. He signed with the Saints in 2006, and along with Sean Payton, they helped revitalize a city.<\/p>\n<p>Brees led the NFL in passing yards in 2006 and helped lead the Saints to the playoffs. He was named an All-Pro for the first time that season, and in 2009, he brought New Orleans their first Super Bowl win.<\/p>\n<p>Brees retired as the NFL&rsquo;s all-time leading passer, throwing for 5,000 yards in a season three times. He was a 13-time Pro Bowl selection and somehow continues to be underrated. He was never voted league MVP, but his numbers more than back up how valuable he was to the Saints for 15 years. Brees is one of the most accomplished quarterbacks in history, and will walk into the Hall of Fame on his first ballot.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>6.

He could win any jump ball because of his height and leaping ability, but was also as fast as a crazed leopard.<\/p>\n<p>Moss had one of the best stretches in NFL history from 2000-10. He had over 1,000 receiving yards on eight different occasions, along with being a four-time Pro Bowler and a three-time All-Pro. He kicked off the century by leading the league in touchdown catches with 15, and was named First-Team All-Pro for the second time in his career.<\/p>\n<p>While he is remembered mostly for his time in Minnesota with the Vikings, his best year came in 2007 with the Patriots. Moss broke the record for most receiving touchdowns in a season with 23, along with reeling in 98 passes for nearly 1,500 yards. He led the NFL in touchdowns again in 2009 with 13, before being traded back to the Vikings.<\/p>\n<p>In total, Moss led the league in touchdown receptions four times. He was a six-time Pro Bowler and a four-time All-Pro, as well as being a member of the 2000s All-Decade Team. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>5.

No one at the position has been as dominant as he was for as long as he was over the last two decades. Tomlinson was drafted fifth overall by the Chargers in 2001, and was an immediate success.<\/p>\n<p>He ran for over 1,200 yards his rookie season and accumulated 10 touchdowns on the ground. He was also a great receiver out of the backfield, catching 59 passes.Two consecutive seasons of 1,600 yards followed in 2002 and 2003, and Tomlinson was named to his first Pro Bowl in 2002.<\/p>\n<p>In 2004, he led the NFL in rushing touchdowns with 17 and was named to his second Pro Bowl, as well as being First-Team All-Pro. This was the start of four consecutive seasons in which Tomlinson would be a Pro Bowler. The Chargers great had his best season in 2006. He broke the NFL record for rushing touchdowns in a season with 28, and had 31 touchdowns in total that season. His 1,815 rushing yards also led the league, and he was named NFL MVP.<\/p>\n<p>Tomlinson retired with 13,684 rushing yards, where he currently ranks seventh all time. He was the heartbeat of the Chargers for a decade, and is the best running back of his era.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>4.

Ray Lewis<\/h3>\n<p>He is in contention for the greatest inside linebacker of all time, and hit harder than anyone in his generation. Ray Lewis oozed fire and passion for the game of football, and he was the soul of the Baltimore Ravens for 17 seasons.<\/p>\n<p>From 2000-12, Lewis was a Pro Bowler nine times and an All-Pro on seven occasions. He was the leader of one of the greatest defenses in NFL history in 2000 that helped the Ravens win the Super Bowl. He had 137 tackles in 2000, along with two interceptions and was named Defensive Player of the Year.<\/p>\n<p>Lewis led the NFL in tackles the following year in 2001 with an amazing 162 total tackles on the season. He got to go out on top after the 2012 season in which the Ravens won their second Super Bowl of the century, defeating the 49ers.<\/p>\n<p>Lewis brought more to the Ravens than just generational talent- he brought a fan base together. His passion was contagious, and it attached itself to every fan that piled into M&amp;T Bank Stadium. He is one of the greatest players of all time, and one that is absolutely synonymous with one team. Ray Lewis was Baltimore. In many ways, he still is.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>3.

Aaron Rodgers<\/h3>\n<p>The body of work that Aaron Rodgers has put up thus far in his career is absolutely remarkable. He has thrown for over 4,000 yards nine times, 40 touchdowns three times, and has won three league MVPs.<\/p>\n<p>What is possibly most impressive about Rodgers is that he makes impossible throws look routine while rarely turning the ball over. Since he became the Packers&rsquo; starter in 2008, he has thrown 10 or more interceptions once, and that came in 2010 when he threw 11 interceptions. He has led the NFL in lowest interception percentage on five different occasions.<\/p>\n<p>Rodgers is a nine-time Pro Bowler, a three time All-Pro, and has won those aforementioned three NFL MVPs. He led the Packers to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Steelers in 2010, and is still chasing that elusive second ring.<\/p>\n<p>From the looks of it, he is still far from done. He is still playing at an elite level at age 38. With quarterbacks seemingly starting to play longer, Aaron Rodgers could keep playing at a high level for several years to come. Whether it is in Green Bay or elsewhere, Rodgers still has a lot of game left in him, and thank goodness for that.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>2.

Peyton Manning<\/h3>\n<p>Peyton Manning is the greatest regular season quarterback in the history of the NFL. That may sound like a backhanded compliment, but it is said with the utmost respect and definitely not with rude intentions.<\/p>\n<p>Manning led the NFL in passing yards three times and broke the record for passing touchdowns in a season twice. His five league MVPs are the most in history. Plus, he is a 14-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro.<\/p>\n<p>For the longest time, Manning was the NFL&rsquo;s equivalent of LeBron James- everyone knew how special he was, but they wondered if he could ever win a ring. When Manning and the Colts overcame a large deficit to beat the Patriots in the 2006 AFC Championship Game, everyone felt like that was finally going to be the year- it was. The Colts beat the Bears in Super Bowl XLI, and Manning silenced the critics.<\/p>\n<p>He closed out his career in Denver. Like John Elway did in the late 1990s, he went out on top. Manning helped usher in the passing game to new heights, and is a large reason why the league is what it is today. He is one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time, and also one of the most accomplished.<\/p>\n<div class=\"next-slide slider\">\n <a class=\"next-slide-btn\" style=\"background:#092f4d\" data-track=\"shortcode\" data-track-action=\"next-slide-shortcode\" href=\"#\">\n <span class=\"title\">Next: <\/span>1.

Tom Brady<\/h3>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone is really surprised to see Tom Brady at the top of this list. Nothing can be said about Brady that hasn&rsquo;t been said in a million other lists, articles, videos, or what have you. The guy is a once in a lifetime player who has accomplished more than any player in the history of the game, maybe in the history of sports.<\/p>\n<p>He was great 15 years ago, he was great five years ago, and he&rsquo;s somehow still great. Even at age 44, he doesn&rsquo;t show signs of slowing down- he is still among the league leaders in nearly every major passing category in 2021. The man was drafted when &ldquo;Maria Maria&rdquo; was the No. 1 song in America, and he is still somehow leading the NFL in touchdown passes through 12 weeks.<\/p>\n<p>Seven Super Bowls, 14 Pro Bowls, and three league MVPs later, Brady is still going strong. Who knows how much longer this ride will last, but it&rsquo;s clear there is still a lot of gas in the car.
