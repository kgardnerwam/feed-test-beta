        <h1>Capturing a forgotten township in South Africa</h1>
                    <strong>Static dreams</strong>
                            <p>Photographers Cyprien Clément-Delmas and Lindokuhle Sobekwa remember documenting a deeply conservative community living in the suburb of Daleside.</p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up in Thokoza, a township southeast of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Johannesburg</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, South Africa, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Magnum Photos member </span><a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/lindokuhle-sobekwa/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lindokuhle Sobekwa</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was raised to respect the collectivist spirit of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ubuntu.</span></i> <span style="font-weight: 400;">“I am because we are,” she says.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like most families in the township, Sobekwa’s parents spent most of their time at work. After his father, a carpenter, passed away, his mother was charged to support four children on her own. She worked in the nearby Afrikaner township of Daleside as a sleep-in domestic worker for a family who forbid her children to enter their home at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feeling of being denied, combined with a sense of curiosity, stayed with Sobekwa, and would come to shape his destiny. In 2012, at the age of 16, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">he was invited to participate in the <em>Of Joy and Soul</em> <em>Project</em> – a long-term art initiative funded by the French art foundation Rubis Mécénat. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">French photographer </span><a href="http://cargocollective.com/ccdelmas"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cyprien Clément-Delmas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Magnum Photos member Bieke Depoorter launched a photography workshop that Sobekwa joined. “Lindodkuhle quickly stood out. We started to spend time together in the township taking pictures,” Clément-Delmas says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“One day, Lindokuhle told me about Daleside: ‘There is an Afrikaner neighbourhood not too far, we should go there to investigate.’ We drove there and became fascinated by the place: the atmosphere, the people, the colours, and the stories they were telling us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From this exploratory visit, a four-year project was born, documenting what remained of the decaying town of Daleside.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The book, entitled <a href="https://gostbooks.com/product/daleside-static-dreams/"><i>Daleside: Static Dreams</i></a> (Gost), brings together portraits of the township’s residents, a mixture of Black and white working-class families who live amid the eerie, desolate landscape.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first year was difficult for us to photograph the community,” Sobekwa says. “Most people said no. Daleside is a very conservative community. Most people there are Christians, so we began attending church service and met a preacher who introduced us to the congregation. That helped the community not to view us as a threat. The community started warming up to us and allowing us in their homes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But without the presence of Clément-Delmas, Sobekwa felt the energies of racism; he was mistaken for a criminal when he came to Daleside to photograph alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The population in Daleside, like in so many other communities in the world: it suffers from a lack of education and opportunity. Alcohol and drugs fill the void for some; religion for others. Violence and abuse cause more violence and abuse. Often, these cycles of abuse last for generations,” Clément-Delmas says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The lack of resources and work puts the society of Daleside under an inevitable collective tension. Daleside is one of the rare places in South Africa where the Black working class and the white working-class are equally poor.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That made me realise that social inequalities are what deeply divides a society. Social justice is what we really have to fight for, here and everywhere.”</span></p>

        <h1>A rare glimpse inside Idaho's Nez Perce tribe</h1>
                    <strong>Meeting the people</strong>
                            <p>As the first photographer welcomed by the Nez Perce in 100 years, Hunter Barnes remembers his time living among the elusive tribe in Lapwai.</p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more than 11,500 years, the </span><a href="https://nezperce.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nez Perce tribe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have inhabited the Columbia River Plateau of the Pacific Northwest in lands that extend across what is now Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. Their name for themselves is <em>Nimíipuu, </em>which means &#8216;we, the people&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;Nez Percé&#8217; comes from French interlopers who indiscriminately described many indigenous people as having the &#8216;pierced nose&#8217; of the nearby Chinook tribe. The Nez Perce signed a treaty with the U.S. government to protect their rights and their land – one which Americans broke repeatedly, reducing the reservation to one-tenth of the agreed 7.5 million acres of land. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today a federally recognised tribe, the Nez Perce number just 3,500 and live on reservations primarily in Idaho. In 2004, American photographer </span><a href="https://www.hunterbarnes.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hunter Barnes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> received an invitation to the Tamkaliks Powwow in Wallowa, Oregon, after a friend suggested he visit and see if it might be possible to document the tribe. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After arriving at the Powwow, Barnes met uncle Irving Waters – a well-respected member of the tribe – who invited him to camp out, then to stay with his family on the reserve. After some time, Barnes was brought to the Sweatlodge – a place few outsiders have ever been, let alone know exist – and was shown the ways of healing and health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tribe welcomed him into their ancient ways of life. Never one to rush into a project, Barnes understands the importance of developing relationships and mutual trust, preferring not to take photos until the time is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He remembers, “We talked about what I wanted to do but it wasn’t until one day after one of the rounds that they looked at me and said, ‘So when are you going to start taking pictures?’ and I said, ‘I guess now, because you asked.’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next four years, Barnes would create a series of 56 photographs in Idaho, Oregon, and Washington documenting the Tamkaliks and Looking Glass Powwows, and the Nez Perce and Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservations, which have just been collected for the new book, </span><a href="https://www.artbook.com/9781909526754.html"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The People</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Reel Art Press). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No one has lived with them since [photographer] <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/edward-curtis-epic-project-to-photograph-native-americans-162523282/">Edward S. Curtis</a>. It had been a 100 years,” Barnes says. &#8220;They took me in&#8230; that’s a big deal. They trusted me just to be there. There were a lot of barriers at first, but rightfully so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Living with Nez Perce on-and-off over the years changed Barnes’s life, imparting upon him the wisdom of listening from within. He remembers just as he finished printing the original series, a strange truck pulled up into his driveway. It was his friend Justin, from the reserve. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Justin said, ‘I had a feeling I was supposed to come find you now,’” Barnes recalls. “I said, ‘I just finished printing these and have to give them out.’ Justin said, ‘Let me be your messenger. I think you learned something from us: Always use your telepathy.’”</span></p>

        <h1>How dub became a defining sound of '70s Britain</h1>
                    <strong>Bass odyssey</strong>
                            <p>An exhibition at the Museum of London seeks to unearth the cultural and social impact dub music has had on the identity of the capital. </p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 300;">From Kingston, Jamaica, to the streets of Hackney and Ladbroke Grove, dub music has profoundly impacted </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">communities and culture across the world over the last 50 years. With its </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">heavy beat of drum and bass, and spellbinding spacing of reverb and echo, dub’s sound is unmistakable; worlds away from the reggae music it stemmed from in the 1960s. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Thanks to the </span><a href="https://www.huckmag.com/topics/windrush/"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Windrush generation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> that arrived from the Caribbean after World War II, dub flourished in Britain. It was in London that dub record labels were established and produced, before being exported to the rest of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Dub would go onto influence multiple sounds, from grime to garage and hip-hop, as well as genres inextricably linked to London, such as punk and post-punk, with bands such as The Clash and The Slits incorporating elements of dub in their work. But dub in its traditional form still survives, with the genre’s original pioneers – among them Lee Scratch Perry and Mad Professor – continuing to produce new material. </span></p>

<div id="attachment_443793" style="width: 1307px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-443793" class="size-full wp-image-443793" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-9-%C2%A9-Sydney-Orleans-Harding_Museum-of-London.jpg" alt="" width="1297" height="1016" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-9-%C2%A9-Sydney-Orleans-Harding_Museum-of-London.jpg 1297w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-9-%C2%A9-Sydney-Orleans-Harding_Museum-of-London-624x489.jpg 624w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-9-%C2%A9-Sydney-Orleans-Harding_Museum-of-London-768x602.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1297px) 100vw, 1297px" /><p id="caption-attachment-443793" class="wp-caption-text">Photograph of two uniformed policemen dancing with two carnival-goers at the Notting Hill Carnival.

<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Now, an exhibition at the Museum of London entitled </span><a href="https://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london/whats-on/exhibitions/dub-london"><i><span style="font-weight: 300;">Dub London: Bassline of a City</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> is paying tribute to the genre’s rich, multilayered legacy. “Spending time with the Rastafari movement, I learned very quickly that dub was much more spiritual,” says exhibition curator </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terry Dhaliwal Davies of her research</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">“The bass is very, very deep. Several times people have described it to me as something going through your body… and how it feels like healing.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">Much of the genre’s history revolves around record shops, which for decades have acted as vital community hubs and meeting points. “If you arrived in Britain [from Jamaica], it was one of the first places you went to,&#8221; explains </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dhaliwal Davies. </span><span style="font-weight: 300;">&#8220;It was where you could eat, meet a producer, or just talk about back home.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">These stores have become part of the fabric of London, with places like West London&#8217;s </span><a href="https://www.peckingsrecords.com/"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Peckings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;"> – a record shop established in 1960 passed down through generations – still to this day standing. </span></p>
<div id="attachment_443794" style="width: 1542px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-443794" class="size-full wp-image-443794" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-10-%C2%A9-Peter-Marshall_Museum-of-London.jpg" alt="" width="1532" height="1016" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-10-%C2%A9-Peter-Marshall_Museum-of-London.jpg 1532w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-10-%C2%A9-Peter-Marshall_Museum-of-London-737x489.jpg 737w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-10-%C2%A9-Peter-Marshall_Museum-of-London-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-10-%C2%A9-Peter-Marshall_Museum-of-London-402x267.jpg 402w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dub-London-10-%C2%A9-Peter-Marshall_Museum-of-London-313x207.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 1532px) 100vw, 1532px" /><p id="caption-attachment-443794" class="wp-caption-text">Notting Hill Carnival, All Saints Road, 21 August 1994. Photo credit: Peter Marshall/Museum of London.</p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">The exhibition also touches on the political dimension of dub, and the experience of being Black and British in London during the &#8217;70s. On display are two photos by </span><a href="https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1260719/darcus-howe-anti-national-front-photograph-shelton-syd/"><span style="font-weight: 300;">Syd Shelton of the Battle of Lewisham </span></a><span style="font-weight: 300;">– a protest held by the National Front on 13 August 1977 under the pretext of demonstrating against street crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 300;">In a quote accompanying the photos, Red Saunders – one of the founders of <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/film-2/white-riot-how-rock-took-on-racism-in-britain/">Rock Against Racism</a> – recalls being at the protest, and seeing an elderly Black woman on her balcony blaring Bob Marley in a show of solidarity with the protesters. “I think that really gives the backdrop of how dub became a connection between London and Jamaica,” says </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dhaliwal Davies</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alongside this historic photography are more recent images commissioned by the Museum of London captured at Nottinghill Carnival, which was cancelled this year for the first time in its 54-year history due to <a href="https://www.huckmag.com/?s=covid+19">COVID-19</a>. These photos follow the duo behind Channel One sound system – Mikey Dread and Jah T –who have been playing at carnival since 1983. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">Vinyl has been back in fashion for quite a long time and people are wanting to explore record shops,” says Dhaliwal Davies, reflecting on the genre’s continued popularity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> “</span><span style="font-weight: 300;">People sometimes assume dub happened in a certain time. But, it&#8217;s still going strong.”</span></p>

        <h1>A visual diary of Black artists coming of age in the '90s</h1>
                    <strong>Living to create</strong>
                            <p>After acquiring a Polaroid camera, photographer Lyle Ashton Harris began capturing a transformative period of his life as a young artist studying at Cal Arts.
</p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1985, </span><a href="https://www.lyleashtonharris.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lyle Ashton Harris</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> travelled to Amsterdam to visit his brother, where he had an epiphany. Harris – then an economics major in his junior year at Wesleyan College – was truly an artist. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I went over a wannabe izod prep, came back with orange hair, and dropped out of [econ] school,” he says. “My South African stepfather encouraged my family to let me do what I needed to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris had switched majors, studied photography, and received his MFA before pursuing his masters at the California Institute of the Arts in Los Angeles. “Cal Arts was on the cutting edge, contemporary thinking around art theory, AIDS activism, feminism, and the like.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It was a ripe period where not only were these ideas being discussed in the classroom, but the activism spilled out into the street around communities like ACT Up and Gran Fury,” Harris continues. </span></p>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443748" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-shot-2020-09-24-at-2.04.50-PM.png" alt="" width="815" height="575" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-shot-2020-09-24-at-2.04.50-PM.png 815w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-shot-2020-09-24-at-2.04.50-PM-693x489.png 693w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-shot-2020-09-24-at-2.04.50-PM-768x542.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help adjust to his new environment, Harris visited the famed Samy’s Camera shop, purchased a Polaroid camera and colour slide film, and started making photographs of his everyday life. Over time, the photos became a visual diary of a transformative period of Harris’s life as he made his early forays into the world of art.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the new exhibition </span><a href="https://icamiami.org/exhibition/lyle-ashton-harris/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ecktachrome Archive</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Harris looks back at this seminal period through a selection of 36 photographs and 15 journals from the early 1990s. The show chronicles a new generation of Black artists and scholars at historic events such as the <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/black-popular-culture">Black Popular Culture</a> and </span><a href="https://www.twn.org/catalog/pages/responsive/cpage.aspx?rec=936&amp;card=price"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Black Nations/Queer Nations?</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The 90s was analogue,” Harris says. “It seems now almost mythical how people were able to form communities, spheres of intimacy, parties or club life, which the archive documents. We can’t overstate how important it was to have that kind of exchange with people.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was in these shared spaces that Harris met Black artists and activists including Marlon Riggs, Faith Ringgold, Angela Davis, Vaginal Davis, bell hooks, and Carrie Mae Weems. As a photographer documenting the scene, Harris occupied a unique vantage point as the consummate insider-meets-outsider, able to engage and observe with equal aplomb. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The work was a way to document relationships and friendships. I&#8217;m intuitive, understanding the power of the image, at the time meeting people, many who became friends, there was an insatiableness that I had. I craved this alternative family and wanted to give voice to the power of communities and resistance, to the people and institutions that have always been there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harris rediscovered the archive at his mother’s home in 2013 after returning to the United States after living in Ghana for seven years. “It was intense re-encountering them,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Going through them was such a process of reacquainting myself. It transported me back to certain periods that informed where I am today but also what this next generation is yearning for… an idyllic period where there was intimacy and community building, where things happened in a more organic way.”</span></p>

        <h1>‘I almost got vocal lessons, Björk said “Don’t do it!”’</h1>
                    <strong>Tricky in conversation</strong>
                            <p>Ahead of the release of his new EP, Fall to Pieces, trip-hop pioneer Tricky chats to Huck about living in Berlin and why his sound has always defied expectation. </p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I got no idea, I got no rules,” says Tricky down the phone. His voice is instantly familiar as a rich, west-country burr in conversation and a seductive whisper across fourteen albums and over three decades. He is explaining why Tricky – that most singular of British artists – does what Tricky does.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think you can know too much,” says the now 52-year-old artist, real name Adrian Thaws. He has a reputation for occasional gruffness – yet on the phone today he is warm and in the moment. He could easily be nostalgic – after all Maxinquaye, his stone-cold classic Mercury-nominated debut album, turned a quarter of a century-old this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, along with fellow Bristolians Portishead and Massive Attack (to whom he was an original member), the album’s eerie blend of late-night hip hop, sound system culture, rock, sultry-jazz singing courtesy of Martina Topley-Bird amplified that new form of lopsided and distinctly English music we got to know as trip-hop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yet, despite occasional moments in the spotlight – like the time he was Björk’s boyfriend or when he popped up as a Gaultier-clad henchman in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fifth Element</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – there’s always been something deeply idiosyncratic that has kept Tricky an outlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t know that something can&#8217;t work,” he says. “People have been telling me for years I have weird time signatures. For me, it’s not weird: that’s just how I hear things. This is why my music doesn’t age – it’s because I don&#8217;t know how to make a traditionally formatted song. I was tempted to get vocal lessons once and it was Björk who said to me ‘Don&#8217;t do it!’ She said I have weird melodies and if I learn to sing, it might take it away from me.”</span></p>
<img class="alignnone wp-image-443736 size-full" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thinking-Of-e1605200203286.jpg" alt="" width="759" height="1200" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thinking-Of-e1605200203286.jpg 759w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Thinking-Of-e1605200203286-309x489.jpg 309w" sizes="(max-width: 759px) 100vw, 759px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the decades, he’s moved from the UK to New York to LA to Paris, back to London and currently, he resides in Berlin. It’s a city steeped in the romantic imagery of artists in self-imposed exile and it’s also where he recorded the recent LP, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fall To Pieces</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like David Bowie’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Low</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, both albums were recorded in Berlin and feature some songs that have unusually abrupt endings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve never heard any of David Bowie&#8217;s stuff here,” he says. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t get influenced like that. Chris Blackwell [founder of Island Records] told me years ago that my songs just start [abruptly] and then they just finish. I’m not sure why people are noticing that now.&#8221; His relationship with Berlin seems much more practical:</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8220;It’s just easy to live in Berlin,&#8221; he says, &#8220;I live quite simply, I like to walk to the supermarket, buy my shopping and cook food. In London I was in taxis for an hour and a half all the time, going to meet people on the other side of the city.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right now, he’s brimming with enthusiasm over an EP of reworks of the track </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In The Doorway</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">,  featuring vocals from fan-sourced competition winners. Tricky picked two winners and set about remixing his own track to fit their stylings. He explains: “I&#8217;m supposed to be a successful musician, I don&#8217;t have to work with someone famous. That girl (winner, Louise Franca) did the vocals on her phone in Brazil. Music is really simple, you don&#8217;t need to use studios. You don&#8217;t need to have ‘brand’ people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He similarly lights up while talking about the happy accident that led him to find vocalist Marta Kacprzak – who takes centre stage on <em>Fall </em><em>to Pieces – </em>when, on tour two years ago, his band suddenly found themselves without a singer.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Tricky - Fall Please feat. Marta" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAEiIF5parQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Marta was working in a bar, ” he says. “She learnt the chorus of the single and just sounded great. She left everything right behind to tour with me for two years. It was her first time doing anything outside of Poland.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With all the anxiety-inducing noise of our times, Tricky was a reassuring voice. With a new album around the corner, he’s just getting on and creating. “I’ve just been to the gym with my trainer [and then] I’ll go home to cook, and think about recording.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’ve got to not give a fuck,” Tricky says. “If I kept giving a fuck about stuff, I would of panicked.” This seems to be the Tricky ethos in 2020, helped by his staying off social media for the last couple of years – particularly in this maelstrom of a time. “Do you know what?” he says, “I give up on it (social media), I’m all about getting my music better. It gets to a point where this is where we are and nothing’s going to change for the moment.”</span></p>

        <h1>Voting among the dead at a San Francisco's mausoleum</h1>
                    <strong>A grave moment </strong>
                            <p>Last week, San Francisco residents cast their ballots in a most unusual location. Huck spoke to some of them to find out why this year was a moment to vote like your life depended on it.</p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was a quiet solemnity across the city last week as San Francisco went to the polls in the US election, perhaps nowhere more so than in a quiet corner of the Richmond District. Just north of San Francisco University lies the Columbarium – the last mausoleum in the city and perhaps one of the most unlikely locations for a polling place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year has been colloquially called a year to vote like your life depended on it. Four years of the Trump administration have seen an America almost torn apart. His fast and loose grip on the truth, policies of hate and division and structural incompetence have pushed the country to the edge. As people voted in this month&#8217;s elections around 1,500 American were dying a day in the country’s worsening Coronavirus pandemic. Many blamed the eye-watering numbers on Trump’s seemingly emphatic devotion to mismanaging the crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People are dying without a care in this country. Even with all the bluster and the noise of the election cycle, it’s undeniable that the lives of thousands were on the ballot. For those voting in the Columbarium, this could not have been clearer. Nothing puts that which is at stake in sharper relief than voting amongst the dead. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443721" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.04.07.png" alt="" width="674" height="1008" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.04.07.png 674w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.04.07-327x489.png 327w" sizes="(max-width: 674px) 100vw, 674px" /></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.dignitymemorial.com/funeral-homes/san-francisco-ca/san-francisco-columbarium-funeral-home/8131"><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco Columbarium and Funeral Home</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – a treasured piece of Victorian-era history and sacred world-renown architecture – is special in myriad ways. The inside niches and stained glass windows within the column and the periphery of the main building have stood the test of time, standing their ground against an ever-changing city. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This whole area [in the Richmond District portion of the city] used to be cemeteries years and years and years ago. Back in the 20s, they decided </span><a href="https://www.kqed.org/news/10779164/why-are-so-many-dead-people-in-colma-and-so-few-in-san-francisco"><span style="font-weight: 400;">to move all the people that were buried in the local cemetery here to Colma</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (a city south of San Francisco city limits) and they grandfathered the Columbarium in,” Brian Kestenblatt, general manager of the Columbarium explained.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The [building people are voting in] opened in 1898,” Kestenblatt continued.  “It changed hands a few times. People have been voting here for at least 15 years. It’s a beautiful spot. It’s very peaceful. It has a great theme to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, a steady flow of voters trickled in. One poll worker recounted how an elderly woman who’d lost her husband earlier this year made a point to come in to vote for the first time this year. </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443722" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.04.49.png" alt="" width="655" height="432" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.04.49.png 655w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.04.49-313x207.png 313w" sizes="(max-width: 655px) 100vw, 655px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most voters coming into the space were reserved and quiet. The Columbarium, unlike many of the city’s other unique venues that’d been turned into polling places such as </span><a href="https://thebolditalic.com/san-francisco-leather-bar-transforms-into-sex-positive-polling-station-6812636bd70"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a leather bar</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offered a peaceful port in the storm of one of America’s most fractious and tumultuous elections in generations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This election is the third time Eric Brenner, 31, has voted at the Columbarium. Like many during an intense time, he coped with the reflexology of routine to process things. For him, voting at the mausoleum is simply a matter of convenience as he lives in the area. Perhaps the death of this year has desensitised him to the irony of things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I always vote every time I can to have my voice heard. It’s a habit. I cannot name one [issue] that brought me out here or to vote in particular.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brenner seemed accepting of the uncertainty of the upcoming election results. He was noticeably a bit more muted and reserved when asked about the direct issues that motivated his choice beyond maintaining a steadfast living homeostasis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m nervous [about the outcome of the election] but I don’t know. I think I’m taking it better than a lot of people. Or I’m just not as nervous as other people.”</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443724" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.05.21.png" alt="" width="577" height="864" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.05.21.png 577w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.05.21-327x489.png 327w" sizes="(max-width: 577px) 100vw, 577px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Papiri, 31, made a point to come in to drop in his ballot on Tuesday at the Columbarium rather than make a trek south to a neighbouring county where he used to live and was previously registered. Like many residents of the city, he didn’t know that he could vote here without being personally directed to the location. He half laughed when it was brought up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t really even think about it but you’re right. It is a bit weird given everything,” he said as he looked around him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s more riding on this election than the typical election,” Papiri stated. “It’s important for me because it seems like a lot of protections and, for instance, environmental laws that were put in place in previous administrations or any sort of general normalcy is slowly being eroded. I want to make my voice heard and make sure that those protections are kept in place. I think it extends beyond environmental protections to civil rights. I would like to see William Barr and the Trump Administration out the door.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deidre Kennedy, an Irish middle-aged woman who has lived in the neighbourhood for sixteen years has familiarity with the space and has voted at the Columbarium for several election cycles. </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443725" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.12.13.png" alt="" width="567" height="864" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.12.13.png 567w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-12-at-09.12.13-321x489.png 321w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 100vw, 567px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a very historical day. I also exercise my right to vote at all costs. I’ve been voting here for years.” she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kennedy stated that she has a deep connection with the place and its time in history both as a space for the dead but also with the timing of the election itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s a connection to the past, the people who have been here, the ancestor energy,” Kennedy said. “With the Day of the Dead yesterday, it’s an ancestor time of the year. I’ve always thought that there was something suspicious about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Lots of people who came before us didn’t even have the right to exercise their right to vote. There is an honour in this that we should all respect. It’s an important moment in history. I’d like to see some female energy in there too. We need change. We are ready for a big change. The world needs it as well on an international level. It’s really important for international relations. Climate wise there is a lot at stake. We are in the eleventh-hour in a lot of ways. We need stronger leaders.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether by convenience, by luck or with intention, the voters using the Columbarium this year all did so against the backdrop of seismic threats to the lives of those not just in the city, or indeed the country, but around the world. Many hoped their vote would be the end for Trump and his America, who’s callousness has woven death into the fabric of society. Perhaps cloaked in the shadow of the already departed was the best, most poignant place in America to cast a vote for life.</span></p>

        <h1>An unflinching portrait of 1980s Birmingham</h1>
                    <strong>Back to Brummie</strong>
                            <p>In the late 1980s, photographer Richard Davis set forth documenting Birmingham's working-class neighbourhoods and spotlighting injustices that were too often ignored. </p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 1984, at the age of 18, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/wireddavis?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Richard Davis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> left home and moved into a shared house in the Moseley District of Birmingham. “It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">felt a good fit for me – alternative, full of young people and open-minded,” he says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I remember someone in the house telling me about a centre for the unemployed run by the Birmingham Trades Council, which was located within walking distance of our house in Sparkhill – an inner-city </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">neighbourhood with a large Asian and Irish population.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the centre, Davis discovered a darkroom and making photographs, an expensive practice made possible by the generous supply of free film, paper, and chemicals. “Its staff offered nothing but encouragement and support. They would often send me out onto the streets of Birmingham armed with a camera and tell me not to come back until I had a decent set of photos,” he says. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This really made me aware of my everyday surroundings and helped me create a lifelong love of the light, the architecture, the people, and how everything interacts together</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I would then spend the next few days developing and printing my films in their darkroom. This was the education I&#8217;d craved but never found at school from a few years before. There was no turning back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the next four years, Davis would traverse the city making photographs, which have just been published in </span><a href="https://www.caferoyalbooks.com/shop/richard-davis-tales-from-the-second-cities-birmingham-19851988"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tales From The Second Cities Birmingham 1985–1988</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Café Royal Books). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspired by the photographs coming out of the 1984-85 Miners Strike along with the works of Gordon Parks and Don McCullin as well as filmmakers Jim Jarmusch and Wim Wenders, Davis set forth to document the local working-class neighbourhoods. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an 18-year-old, seeing how communities came together to support the strikers helped me understand politics and class issues, and how powerful solidarity could be. Photography played an important role in highlighting injustices for the working classes who normally were just ignored,” Davis says. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“From the beginning, the Centre staff </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">helped me learn how a photographer could help. They sent me to a run-down house where an Asian family with young children lived in very poor, unhealthy conditions. My photographs were published in the papers and the family’s problems were finally dealt with. Things like this were a lesson in the power of photography.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a lesson Davis took with him when he left Birmingham at the age of 22 to teach photography at Manchester Polytechnic and continue his </span><a href="https://www.huckmag.com/art-and-culture/photography-2/documenting-life-on-the-fringes-in-thatchers-britain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">journey through photography</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> there. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The book </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">has made me quite nostalgic for my old life in Birmingham and in particular for Sparkhill. I was young and all of a sudden I had this new world opening up in front of me. Various family members still live in Birmingham so I return from time to time but never for long. The City Centre is unrecognisable from the 1980s. Everything is glass. Birmingham doesn&#8217;t feel like home anymore.”</span></p>

        <h1>Speaking to tourists at Four Seasons Total Landscaping</h1>
                    <strong>Make Gardening Great Again!</strong>
                            <p>The site of a bizarre post-election press conference on the outskirts of Philadelphia has become a place of pilgrimage for all those glad to see the end of Trump’s presidency.</p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take the exit off of Interstate-95 in Philadelphia’s northern outskirts and you’ll find yourself on State Road. It’s an unloved and entirely unremarkable industrial street you could find anywhere across urban America, with a predictable assortment of auto-repair shops, gas stations and workshops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re a long way away from Trump Tower and the infamous elevator descent Donald Trump used to launch his bid for the presidency in June 2015, but now this street has a celebrity swagger about it, too, and is drawing visitors from across Pennsylvania and beyond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everybody is here to visit Four Seasons Total Landscaping, which until this past Saturday, was your regular garden and maintenance business. The Trump campaign sprinkled it with stardust by holding a chaotic post-election press conference here. Now, the fans keep coming and staff have locked the doors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s no need for anyone to give out Hollywood-style star maps here; everyone knows the routine: selfies outside the doorway to Four Seasons Total Landscaping, then walk a few metres down to Fantasy Island adult bookstore to snap a few more pics. A handful of more committed visitors will get some shots of Delaware Valley Crematorium Center across the road.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443670" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AeeAahG4.jpeg" alt="" width="1494" height="1991" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AeeAahG4.jpeg 1494w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AeeAahG4-367x489.jpeg 367w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AeeAahG4-768x1023.jpeg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/AeeAahG4-1153x1536.jpeg 1153w" sizes="(max-width: 1494px) 100vw, 1494px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We saw it on the news and we just had to come and see it for ourselves,” explains Briane and Larry, a middle-aged couple who have driven 12-miles from their home in Bucks County to get their photos outside Total Landscaping’s front door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once they’re satisfied, they walk to the end of the building, to the chain-link fence, to try to get into the yard and catch a glimpse of the garage door to which the campaign hastily pinned up their logos – and the now infamous pile of manure. As if their ear-to-ear grins weren’t enough proof, Briane makes explicit: “Oh we hate him [Trump] by the way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time and time again during Trump’s four-year stint in the White House, there have been occurrences so bizarre that you have to pinch yourself and ask if this is, in fact, real. Repeatedly, we have been forced to watch spectacles so shambolic that it’s hard not to find yourself wondering if the joke really is on us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the crowning glory of Trumpian sub-par political circus came on Saturday November 7, when the President’s personal lawyer, former New York City mayor Rudy Guiliani, delivered a press conference to allege – without evidence, again – that widespread voter fraud had occurred in the city of Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trump tweeted out the venue, Four Seasons Philadelphia, then clarified in a <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325087011464749056">subsequent tweet</a> that the location was Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia – not, in fact, the luxury hotel chain, as everyone was lead to believe, but the backyard of a garden centre – opposite a crematorium and a few doors down from a sex shop. Some sort of mistake had clearly been made, but why Trump and his team persisted with the venue has left many people baffled. </span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443671" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANTASY-ISLAND.jpeg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANTASY-ISLAND.jpeg 1920w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANTASY-ISLAND-367x489.jpeg 367w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANTASY-ISLAND-768x1024.jpeg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANTASY-ISLAND-1152x1536.jpeg 1152w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANTASY-ISLAND-1536x2048.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This unlikely location was forever forced into the annals of political mythology as Guiliani – with an enormous pile of manure sitting just out of shot – was told mid-briefing that the election had been called for Joe Biden, as he won Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral college votes to secure the presidency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Bad things happen in Philadelphia, bad things,” <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/trump-bad-things-happen-in-philadelphia-debate-20200930.html">Trump said</a> during a September presidential debate with Biden, attempting to stoke fears of electoral fraud and discredit an election he looked set to lose. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s something Philadelphians have not forgotten. So, it’s almost poetic then, that – despite a bomb scare near the Convention Centre where votes were being counted and </span><a href="https://6abc.com/philadelphia-attack-pennsylvania-convention-center-plot-pa-election/7689932/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two armed men in a Hummer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intent on “straightening things out” were intercepted by law enforcement – strong turnout in Philadelphia helped seal the victory for the Democratic presidential candidate. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been four days since the election was called for Biden and Trump has refused to concede, but Four Seasons Total Landscaping is still drawing an eager crowd. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wearing a multicoloured Biden tank top, another tourist called Joseph runs up the steps to the store, lifts a huge bottle of Wild Turkey bourbon whiskey and snaps himself as he chugs it down. “I wanted a picture of this to show my friends,” he says. “People aren&#8217;t going to forget this place any time soon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A young blonde woman, Justine, has driven here from downtown Philadelphia. She has her boss on the phone from Georgia, who’s insistent on bagging himself an authentic Four Seasons Total Landscaping t-shirt. “I asked one of the workers as he left but he seemed a little sceptical,” she explains.</span></p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443666" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1JuYxPQ0.jpeg" alt="" width="1824" height="1368" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1JuYxPQ0.jpeg 1824w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1JuYxPQ0-652x489.jpeg 652w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1JuYxPQ0-285x214.jpeg 285w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1JuYxPQ0-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1JuYxPQ0-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1824px) 100vw, 1824px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are now three groups outside the shop’s front door and a spirit of camaraderie develops as they take it in turns to photograph each other posing beneath the Four Seasons Total Landscaping logo. It’s a tribute to Trump’s continued ability to bring people together – whether in adoration or revulsion. Like Justine, they want t-shirts, but knocking on the door gets no response. So, they’re waiting until four PM when the business closes, in the hopes of catching the employees leaving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A friendly employee in a fluffy sweater called Melissa is the first to leave. She doesn’t seem surprised by the small crowd that greets her as she opens the door. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;How did you end up hosting Trump&#8217;s concession speech that wasn&#8217;t a concession speech?&#8221; I manage to ask her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She chuckles, regains composure and replies in a professional tone: “You know, we&#8217;re not allowed to say anything right now. I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>
<p>I probe as to whether she could share any personal recollections of the event.  “I’m really sorry, I&#8217;m not allowed to say ANYTHING,” she responds. But she takes my card, and promises to get in touch when they decide to break their silence.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443675" src="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OGvs4xcM.jpeg" alt="" width="1445" height="1084" srcset="https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OGvs4xcM.jpeg 1445w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OGvs4xcM-652x489.jpeg 652w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OGvs4xcM-285x214.jpeg 285w, https://dch81km8r5tow.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OGvs4xcM-768x576.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1445px) 100vw, 1445px" />
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She refuses to answer any further questions, directs the crowd to </span><a href="https://www.fstl1992.com/fstlmerch"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the website</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> where they can buy t-shirts, hoodies and stickers created by the company in response to their new-found global fame, and gets in her car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The crowds keep coming. After class, Daniel, 18, and his high school friends drove over 45-minutes to snap their pictures outside Four Seasons Total Landscaping. “It’s a really defining event of the Trump administration: misinformation and miscommunication,” he says. “A pathetic end to a pathetic presidency.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’re talking a thick plume of black smoke rises above Delaware Valley Crematorium Center, on the opposite side of the road. Trump’s presidency is dead, too – despite his refusal to concede. Now, it’s just a question of how much of America gets caught up in the toxic fumes, as his dreams of holding on to power go up in smoke.</span></p>

        <h1>Inside a vibrant '90s Kingston dancehall community</h1>
                    <strong>No Gyal Can Test</strong>
                            <p>Photographer Akeem Smith has spent much of his life chronicling the creative spirit of dancehall and his archive forms a love letter to the culture that raised him.</p>
            </header>

        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dancehall emerged in Jamaica in the late 1970s, as a new generation forged an indigenous national identity coming of age in the years following independence from the UK. Embracing the already well-established tradition of sound system culture, the movement made itself known at local gatherings around Kingston, quickly radiating across the Caribbean diaspora. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Growing up between Kingston and Brooklyn, Section 8 fashion designer, stylist, and artist </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/akeemouch/?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akeem Smith</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 29, became heavily involved in the dancehall scene. His aunt Paula and grandmother co-founded the Ouch Collective – a niche fashion house that created iconic outfits for the dancers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past 12 years, Smith began creating an extensive archive of artefacts chronicling the 1990s dancehall scene that forms the basis for the new exhibition, </span><a href="https://redbullarts.com/newyork/exhibition/akeem-smith-no-gyal-can-test/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Gyal Can Test</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smith weaves together scenes from the era in a multi-disciplinary show that combines photography, video, ephemera, sculpture, fashion, and audio components to evoke the extraordinary creative spirit of dancehall. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Akeem’s a poet with an exceptional personal history from which he draws upon, using his growing archive and a carefully culled collection of objects and architectural remnants to weave together compositions that tell a richer story of dancehall that counters the common pop culture narrative,” says Max Wolf, Chief Curator at Red Bull Arts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“With </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">No Gyal Can Test</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Akeem aims to venerate the women, the fashion, and the under-sung practitioners of the movements nocturnal economy in order to cement this significant period and its collection of fleeting memories for future generations.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To create an archive of this scale and scope, Smith maintains an extensive network of family, friends, and members of the dancehall community connected with the Ouch Collective. What isn’t seen but can be felt in the detail the photographer brings to the show is the care and support for the people behind the work. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project got its start years ago when Smith helped Photo Morris, a close friend, to organise his archive of thousands of images made over several decades documenting the dancehall community. After Morris died, the archive was bequeathed to Smith, providing him with one of the most extensive records of the period and sparking his interest in preserving shadow archives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Morris had made his living making photographs of women at the dance, and selling prints to them the next day, taking exquisite care to record the dates, venues, and various notes about when they were made, creating an enduring document of a pre-digital social network and nocturnal economy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The presence of the cameras at a dance both validated the hype and significance of the event, as well as the potential for greater visibility, reach and mobility for the lucky few captured in the cameras promising gaze,” Wolf says. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was important to get photographed, or beamed up in the video light, so your presence was known and could potentially circulate within the vibrant Caribbean communities throughout the world that these photos and VHS tapes were sent.”</span></p>

        <h1>Huck 74: The Action Issue</h1>
                    <strong>Out now!</strong>
                            <p>Our latest print instalment is about people on the move – all of whom are actively working to change the world around them. </p>
            </header>
    <main>
        <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘Action’ has always been at the heart of <a href="https://huck.imbmsubscriptions.com/back-issues/"><em>Huck</em></a>. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the early days, the mid-noughties, that relationship was perhaps more literal. The magazine was born out of surf and skate culture: our first eight cover stars, for instance, came directly from those worlds. While, back then, <em>Huck</em> involved itself with all manner of topics, the rebellious heritage of action sports remained the constant thread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As time went on, the publication evolved in conjunction. <em>Huck</em>’s tradition was never in question (again: surf, skate), but its connection to those core scenes – those core ideas – became more tangential. As attitudes, they became vehicles through which to navigate new corners of culture. So physical action became political action, social action, creative action, and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You get the point. What I’m trying to say is, it seems strange that we’ve managed to go this long without dedicating an entire magazine to the notion that has long helped bind everything together. Because in times such as these, the act of getting up and <em>doing</em> something – of making something happen for yourself – has never felt more urgent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So here we are. <a href="https://huck.imbmsubscriptions.com/back-issues/"><strong>Huck 74: The Action Issue</strong>. </a></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our latest print instalment, you’ll find skateboarders in Beirut fighting for public space, months after that cataclysmic blast changed their city forever. There are surfers, too, this time in the form of ‘Color The Water’, an LA surf collective who formed during the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder. We have roller skaters, basketball players and a teenage quad bike crew in Oman. Vic Mensa is here as well, plus Chuck D and Róisín Murphy, while there’s a tour of Red River Gorge, Kentucky, courtesy of climber Kathy Karlo. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short: these are stories of people in constant motion, all of whom are actively working to change the world around them. Because in this respect, there’s always work to be done. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">– <em>Niall</em></span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Flynn, Editor</span></em></p>
