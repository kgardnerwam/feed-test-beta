<p>Having worked with rising French fashion designer <a href="/marine-serre">Marine Serre</a> for her latest <a href="/fashion/article/50629/1/ongoing-guide-paris-fashion-week-marine-serre-dior-margiela-rick-owens-ss21">SS21 collection</a> earlier this year, make-up and SFX artist, grills designer, and Dazed Beauty Community member <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisamchlik/">Lisa Michalik</a> has leant her artistic hand to the world of fashion again, this time creating unworldly beauty looks for a campaign for the Parisian vintage shop, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chezsnowbunny/">Snowbunny</a>. </p>
<p>With models dressed in rare 80s and 90s pieces from the store, Michalik sought to embrace the title of the shop in her artistic direction for the shoot, turning the models into bunnies, through creating large and bejewelled fake rabbit teeth. </p>
<p>Working in close collaboration with the store’s founder, make-up artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/victoriasapet/?hl=fr">Victoria Sapet</a> and stylist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marinelate_/">Marine Cuq</a>, the budding creative explains the goal of the shoot was to “give life” to her “bunny friends from Snowbunny”, creating a “parallel between rabbit teeth and bling bling manicures, accented with gems and piercings.” </p>
<p>Featuring dewy make-up, punctuated with OTT eyelash extensions, dramatic red lipstick, and orange blush, elsewhere the model’s hair has been styled into rabbit ears by the hair artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quentin_lafforgue/">Quentin Lafforgue</a>. </p>

<p>Having previously created make-up looks, prosthetics, and transformed teeth for the likes of <em>Novembre</em>, Lanvin, <em>Vogue Portugal</em>, and <a href="https://www.lisamichalik.com/dazed-korea-magazine-decembre">Dazed Korea</a>, Michalik is no stranger to merging the real with the unreal in her otherworldly beauty looks. </p>
<p>Creating vampire fangs, glow-in-the-dark grills, and marble-decked molars – which she boasts to her 15K <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisamchlik/">Instagram</a> followers – <a href="/beauty/community/article/50396/1/lisa-michalik-makeup-artist-grills-designer-interview">Michalik says</a> her fascination with teeth began after becoming “intrigued by dental prosthesis as it echoed the process of special effects.”</p>
<p>Wanting to “create again and again”, this campaign continues to highlight the multi-hyphenate creatives ability to make the strange alluring and beguilingly beautiful. </p>
<p>Shot by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antoine_caillet/">Antoine Caillet</a>, the images will serve as promotion for Snowbunny, whose fans include Jazzelle (@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PMmYVKkPF/">uglyworldwide</a>) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7iUWjKoFDv/">Bella Hadid</a>.

        <p>Queen of the Ringardes Emily Cooper had most of us screaming into a pillow throughout much of <em><a href="/fashion/article/50668/1/unpacking-emily-in-paris-chaotic-avant-basic-bitch-fashion">Emily in Paris</a>, </em>as she mispronounced countless extremely rudimentary French words, got off with her sweet new friend’s boyfriend, and did the unspeakable by momentarily turning pretty much the entire fashion industry off <a href="/fashion/article/35736/1/the-instagram-documenting-the-margiela-tabi-boots-28-year-reign-margielatab1">Tabis</a>. For all those of us grimacing at her sartorial choices, however, a huge number of viewers were seemingly taking notes. </p>
        <p>According to Lyst’s annual <a href="https://www.lyst.co.uk/year-in-fashion-2020/#wanted"><em>Year In Fashion</em> report</a>, which landed this week, page views on Kangol’s bucket hats soared by 324 per cent after Emily rocked the style that earned her the extremely cutting nickname ‘Bucket Hat’ from bratty actress Brooklyn Clark. Searches for <a href="/ganni">Ganni</a> skirts were also up a casual 289 per cent following the episode in which she was seen wearing a yellow asymmetric style by the Scandi label, with those looking for berets climbing 41 per cent week-on-week after the show first aired. With Netflix recently <a href="/fashion/article/51065/1/what-basic-bitch-fashion-will-emily-in-paris-season-2-provide">confirming</a> two more seasons of the divisive show are coming, the good lord only knows what stylist Patricia Field has in store for us next.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

      </div>
        <p>Other big pop cultural moments that saw people rushing to the Google search bar came via <a href="/cardi-b">Cardi B</a> and <a href="/Megan-thee-stallion">Megan Thee Stallion</a>’s immediately iconic “WAP” video, as those looking for leopard and snakeskin prints surged by 201 per cent after its release, and early-lockdown binge-watch <em><a href="/tiger-king">Tiger King</a>, </em>which gave <a href="/kenzo">Kenzo</a>’s signature tiger motif a boost of 200 per cent in April (no news on Carole Baskin’s flower crown, however). As we <a href="/fashion/article/50033/1/searches-for-marine-serre-moon-print-bodysuit-beyonce-black-is-king">previously reported</a>, <a href="/beyonce">Beyoncé</a>’s <em>Black Is King</em> visual album was a huge moment for <a href="/marine-serre">Marine Serre</a> searches, which jumped 426 per cent in just 48 hours – truly, her power. </p>
        <p>Elsewhere, it was a huge year for cosy fashion (duh), with <a href="/fashion/article/47940/1/ranking-the-best-and-worst-croc-collaborations-kfc-balenciaga-post-malone-yeezy">Crocs</a>, Birkenstocks, Ugg slippers, <a href="/nike">Nike</a> sweatpants, <a href="/prada">Prada</a> shorts, and Hamp;M’s flouncy ‘nap’ dress all doing big numbers among online shoppers. No surprises that we were all over masks in a big way – searches were up 502 per cent, with those looking for <a href="/off-white">Off-White</a>’s logo version climbing 450 per cent between January and March alone. </p>
        <p><a href="/pyer-moss">Pyer Moss</a>, <a href="/alyx">1017 ALYX 9SM</a>, and <a href="/martine-rose">Martine Rose</a> were among the top-ten ‘breakout’ fashion brands, with <a href="/telfar">Telfar</a> taking second place behind Marine Serre thanks to its uber-sought-after shopping bag, which experienced yet another surge in popularity when <a href="/alexandria-cortez-ocasio">AOC</a> carried it on Capitol Hill earlier this year. Notably, the progressive politician also earned herself a place among 2020’s most powerful fashion figures, alongside the likes of <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>, <a href="/lizzo">Lizzo</a>, <a href="/travis-scott">Travis Scott</a>, and <a href="/bts">BTS</a>’s Kim Namjoon. </p>

<p><a href="/tag/spike-lee">Spike Lee</a> is set to make a musical about the creators of the erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra, based on David Kushner’s <em>Esquire</em> <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/2018/9/1/all-rise">article</a> “All Rise: The Untold Story of the Guys Who Launched Viagra.”</p>
<p>The article chronicles the discovery and marketing of the drug (sildenafil citrate), its journey from testing labs to bedside tables, and how it had to overcome challenges from Wall Street, Capitol Hill, and the Catholic church on its way up.</p>
<p>“Whose job was it to convince some of America's most powerful institutions that all men deserved boners?”, Kushner <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/2018/9/1/all-rise">writes</a>, “Two guys. This is the story of how an unlikely duo popped the top on a $3-billion-a-year industry.”</p>
<p>Lee is co-writing alongside British playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic, and the film will feature original music from songwriting duo Stew Stewart and Heidi Rodewald.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/spike-lee-viagra-musical-film-pfizer-eone-pre-covid-miracle-drug-kwame-kwei-armah-1234616563/"><em>Deadline</em></a> about the project, Lee thanked his mother for helping him to overcome an early dislike of musicals: “I thank Ms Jacquelyn Shelton Lee. I thank my late mother for as she would say taking ‘my narrow, rusty behind’ dragging, kicking and screaming to the movies when I wuz a nappy headed kid growing up in da streets of da people’s republic of Brooklyn.”</p>
<p>He added: “I did not want to see corny people singin’ and dancin’. Instead I wanted to play with my friends on da block… so finally going into my fourth decade as a filmmaker I will be directing a dancin’ all singin’ musical Spike Lee joint and I can’t wait. My Moms has been waiting too!”</p>
<p>Jackson Pictures and 40 Acres and Mule Filmworks are set to produce the film, while Joanne Lee of Jackson Pictures and Kushner will serve as executive producers.</p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Does anyone actually want a Twitter dislike button?</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">A spokesperson for the social media platform has confirmed that the feature is ‘something we’re exploring’</h3>

<p>Over the last few years, social media users have been calling for a ‘dislike’ button on platforms like <a href="/tag/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="/tag/twitter">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/tag/instagram">Instagram</a>. Rumours of the feature emerge almost yearly, though the update never materialises. Now, Twitter has sparked excitement again by revealing that it’s considering introducing the capacity to ‘dislike’ or ‘downvote’ tweets.</p>
<p>Responding to a <a href="https://twitter.com/find_evil/status/1328760278037770242">critique</a> of the platform by Jackie Singh, a cybersecurity expert for the <a href="/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> campaign, Twitter’s product lead, Kayvon Beykpour, said a ‘dislike’ feature “<a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392">is something we’re exploring</a>”.</p>
<p>Beykpour didn’t reveal any more info, meaning we don’t know when it might arrive, or even if it definitely will – though the prospect of it is enough to get Twitter users talking. “Apparently Twitter is experimenting with adding a dislike button,” one user <a href="https://twitter.com/sisterariola/status/1328844809998651394">tweeted</a>. “Stan wars are going to be an absolute nightmare.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#1, 2 and 4 are literally our top priority (making the public conversation on Twitter) and has been for years. We’ve made a lot of progress but still lots to do. We do feel it’s important to solve other problems too! As for #3, this is something we’re exploring.</p>mdash; Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/RadishHarmers/status/1328873735781306370">joked</a>: “I don’t want Twitter to add a dislike button. I like the site’s atmosphere of positivity and support.”</p>
<p>Some have expressed their dismay at the prospect of the feature, which they say will only heighten anxiety on the app. One user <a href="https://twitter.com/MeganRoseRuiz1/status/1328921966183550979">said</a>: “If Twitter really comes out with a dislike button, I WILL cry if any one of you bitches dislikes my art posts. My art is good and I will fight you even if I’m crying.”</p>
<p>The Blindboy Podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/Rubberbandits/status/1328836796143316994">tweeted</a>, “No, no, no. This is a website where we compete to have the best complaint, and being aggressively combative is rewarded with serotonin hits. More negativity is not the answer. Let people dislike in silence”, before <a href="https://twitter.com/Rubberbandits/status/1328837685071519749">adding</a>, “I don’t need a load of dislikes on my bad takes. I want to be either ignored or passive-aggressively subtweeted. This is the system that works”.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don#39;t want Twitter to add a dislike button.

                    </div>
                </div>
<p>The rumour of a ‘dislike’ button comes as Twitter launches its Fleets feature, which enables users to post tweets that disappear after 24 hours – much like Stories on Instagram or <a href="/tag/snapchat">Snapchat</a>. Users can share text, photos, and videos which will live at the top of people’s timelines and on the sender’s profile, before disappearing after a day.</p>
<p>“Some of you tell us that tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there’s so much pressure to rack up retweets and likes,” Twitter’s design director, Joshua Harris, and product manager, Sam Haveson, wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html">blog post</a>. “Because they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings.”</p>
<p>Some users have criticised the feature, which reportedly allows unwanted direct messages and enables people to tag others who have blocked them. As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/18/fleets-twitter-launches-disappearing-tweets-tool-worldwide"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Twitter says it’s still working on the feature and is listening to any concerns raised.</p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">You can now buy Aphex Twin’s actual Yamaha CS-5 synth on eBay</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The current bid is $15,400</h3>

		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1290/9/1299119.jpg" alt="Aphex Twin Yamaha CS-5 synth" />		<figcaption>
			<span class="fl-credit">via eBay</span>		</figcaption>

	</figure>
<p><a href="/tag/aphex-twin">Aphex Twin</a>’s vintage Yamaha CS-5 synth is up on eBay – that is, if you have a spare 15k lying around.</p>
<p>The analogue monosynth contains the linear notes of <em>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</em> at the bottom, hand-etched by Richard D. James himself. The auction description also includes a statement from Paul Nicholson, who designed Aphex Twin’s logo, confirming that the etchings were photographed and used for the sleeve of <em>Selected Ambient Works Volume II.</em></p>
<p>“This synth was purchased by me in 2006 from a Vemia auction in the UK. Other than loaning it to Ghostly/Suction Records recording artist Solvent to record his RDJCS5ep 12-inch in 2011, the synth has been carefully stored at my house,” reads the seller’s description.</p>
<p>“The synth has never been serviced, repaired, or modified by me, and is in the same condition as when I received it. It runs on 230V UK power, with a UK plug. You can see some additional etchings and markings in the photos – these were all in place (and likely done by Aphex Twin himself) when I received it. It’s in perfect working order as far as I know, but I offer no guarantee of its functional condition; anyone who’s buying this will surely be buying it for its provenance.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-CS-5-synth-w-Selected-Ambient-Works-II-liner-notes-etched-by-Aphex-Twin/184529209534?pageci=9996e6c2-8edf-49fc-8a8b-1daf40037910">current bid</a> stands at $15,400, but with two more days left on the auction, we can expect the number to keep rising. In the meantime, revisit RDJ’s newest releases <a href="/music/article/48708/1/aphex-twin-has-shared-six-new-tracks-listen-now">here</a>.</p>]]>

<p>After <a href="/beauty/head/article/45878/1/introducing-starface-pimple-patches-for-the-instagram-age">launching in 2019</a>, <a href="/beauty/tag/starface">Starface</a> – the Gen Z favourite pimple patch brand – has gained a cult following, through its determination to change the conversation around acne and skincare. Although many spot stickers have come before this (usually transparent, designed to be invisible, and to draw as little attention to the irritated area as possible), Starface has changed this approach, in a big way. </p>
<p>Its mission? To draw as <em>much</em> attention to the irritated area as possible, in an attempt to translate pimples into an opportunity for self-expression. </p>
<p>With the brand’s original big yellow star sticker a bona fide fixture in the beauty community, Starface has gone onto introduce various iterations of its recognisable star-shaped patches – creating magical <a href="/beauty/head/article/48760/1/starface-launch-glow-in-the-dark-pimple-acne-patches-and-they-are-magical">glow-in-the-dark</a> stickers, a <a href="/beauty/head/article/49202/1/starface-julie-schott-space-wash-facial-cleanser-skincare-launch">facial cleanser</a>, and more recently, spot stickers aimed to <a href="/beauty/head/article/50586/1/starface-launch-pimple-patches-to-encourage-young-people-to-vote">encourage young people to vote</a>.</p>

<p>And now, the skincare label is launching its first-ever co-created product and collaboration, with the Japanese company design Sanrio, for a limited edition Hello Kitty collection.</p>
<p>Collaborating on a shared belief that the objects we use and surround ourselves with every day should bring happiness and positivity to our lives, what better time to add some spice to your surroundings now that <a href="/beauty/soul/article/51033/1/wellness-guide-second-lockdown-self-care-exercise">lockdown 2.0</a> is in full swing? Along with helping your skin, these patches will definitely brighten up your walk to Tesco or your hourly saunter around the living room.</p>
<p>Coming in a pack of 32, in an accompanying Big Hello Kitty reusable pod, the stickers will be in the shape of the cute cartoon character, and will help accelerate zit healing by drawing out pimple pus, blocking outside bacteria, and prevent you from poking and picking. Sign us up!</p>

<p><em>Taken from <a href="/the-autumnwinter-2020-issue">the autumn/winter 2020 issue</a> of Dazed. You can pre-order a copy of our latest issue <a href="https://boutiquemags.com/collections/frontpage/products/dazed">here</a></em></p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve been here, but I haven’t,” says Letitia Wright, standing in the middle of All Saints Road. “Even though I haven’t been physically on this street until today, I’ve seen it many times.” We’re in London’s Notting Hill, outside what used to be The Mangrove. “This place got raided so many times, man,” the actress says, peering closely through a window so the yellow of her beanie and pink of her coat flicker back. Two white women with blow-dries exit the building, which is now a cocktail bar and restaurant. Wright hands me her iPhone, and I take a photo of her under the building’s blue plaque, dedicated to its former owner, before we go round the corner to talk some more.</p>
<p>In March 1968, Frank Crichlow established his Caribbean restaurant here. The Mangrove served as a vital community hub for the area’s West Indian community, and a key meeting place for the British Black Panther movement. It was also raided – and ravaged – by the Metropolitan police 12 times in its first 18 months of opening. No drugs were found.</p>
<p>In June 2020, anti-racist protesters in Bristol pulled down a monument to slave owner Edward Colston, dumping the statue into the city’s harbour in solidarity with Black people harassed and brutalised by police all over the world. Fifty years earlier, in August 1970, 150 demonstrators marched down All Saints Road challenging a version of the same story, one that is more embedded in the fabric of British cities than most would like to admit. In 1971, ‘The Mangrove Nine’ – a group of protesters including Crichlow and British Black Panther leader Altheia Jones-LeCointe – were accused of inciting riots and put on trial at the Old Bailey. The verdict was historic: after 55 days, all nine defendants were acquitted. Even more significantly, the judge admitted that the police force had been “motivated by racial hatred”. Or, more accurately, racism.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Wright stars as Jones-LeCointe in <em>Mangrove</em>, the first instalment of artist and director Steve McQueen’s <em>Small Axe</em> anthology: five films centring London’s West Indian community, stretching from the late 1960s through to the mid-1980s. The Windrush scandal became national news when, in 2018, <em>The Guardian </em>reported that hundreds of British subjects who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971 had been wrongfully detained and deported by Theresa May’s government. McQueen, who is of Grenadian and Trinidadian heritage, is interested in filling in the lives of the Windrush generation. These are untold stories like <em>Lovers Rock</em>, which spends a single, sensual night at a sweaty house party in Ladbroke Grove, and <em>Red, White and Blue</em>, the tale of Jamaican-British scientist-turned-police officer Leroy Logan, who joined the force after his father was beaten by the Metropolitan police. Together, they give a sense of a time and place – of what the era looked, sounded, tasted and felt like to the migrant families who came here. That the films will air in a primetime slot on BBC One feels like a form of justice.</p>
<p>“We mustn’t be victims, but protagonists in our own stories,” says Wright’s Jones-LeCointe, soft-spoken but utterly commanding in one of several powerful speeches in <em>Mangrove</em>. Wright embodies the Trinidadian physician and community organiser’s grace and unwavering sense of purpose. She plays her with a quiet intensity, taking fierce care with the opportunity she’s been given to “represent our elders and ourselves”, as she explains it. “If you depend on other people to tell your story – if you wait for other people to tell your story – then it will never be told.”</p>
<p>“Crichlow wanted to have an establishment where people could get together and just have food,” she continues. “It was disrespected for many years. Today, seeing that it’s a peaceful restaurant, and the people coming out don’t even look like us! It’s kind of trippy seeing that.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you depend on other people to tell your story – if you wait for other people to tell your story – then it will never be told” – Letitia Wright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actress, who turned 27 in October, was raised in Guyana until the age of seven. She’s spent the last two decades in London, growing up in Tottenham, where she joined an after-school acting class for kids run by Black Arts Production Theatre (it still exists today). She went on to train in the opposite end of the city, at the Identity School of Acting in Brixton. Wright’s early roles included gritty British dramas <em>Top Boy</em> and Sally El Hosaini’s underrated <em>My Brother the Devil,</em> and she was Emmy-nominated for a role in <em>Black Mirror</em>. “I don’t want to leave Earth like, ‘She did a cool a little film,’” says Wright of her ambitions. “Like, no – (I’d like people to say that) what she did and who she played, who she represented and what she said – it changed my life.” Impact doesn’t come much bigger than the Marvel universe, where Wright is best known as Shuri – impish teenage sister to the late Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, and the brains behind his Black Panther suit.</p>
<p>In real life, Wright is the eldest of six siblings, though among the crew of fellow actors she’s come to think of as family, she’s the baby. “I see Danny (Daniel) Kaluuya as an older brother, and Malachi Kirby. I see Naomie Harris as an older sister. Danai Gurira, I see as an amazing older sister. Definitely, Chadwick represented being my brother,” she says quietly.</p>
<p>Her own Mangrove – her first real “gathering of like-minded people”, as she puts it – was Identity School, where she was able to find friends who became the “brothers and sisters” she still has today. “It was about having a dream – collectively having a purpose. That stemmed from (school founder) Femi Oguns’ influence, (him saying) ‘You can do anything, be anything,’” she says. When I ask what that collective purpose was, Wright puts it this way. “You have this dream, but people say you have to prepare for these huge hurdles that you are not even thinking about. It’s a refusal to give in to what everybody says you should prepare for – failure. Even if you are the first person in your family to (try).”</p>
<p>Wright explains that Identity alumnus John Boyega, who plays Leroy Logan in <em>Red, White and Blue</em>, set the precedent for dreaming beyond bit parts in TV soaps like <em>Casualty</em> and <em>Holby City</em> (the latter was Wright’s screen debut). “He was like, I’m going to book a feature film and be the lead, and we were just like, <em>What? </em>Then he booked <em>Attack the Block.</em> In that film, he played a character called Moses – in the Bible, Moses is the person that’s meant to lead the Israelites to the promised land. Moses was the torchbearer. I can see the parallel,” she says. “John influenced all of us to think bigger.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Another of Wright’s former classmates – and now her <em>Mangrove</em> co-star – Malachi Kirby recalls the day he first met “Tish”. He had been at Identity for a few years already when a new girl arrived. She was “small”, “cute” and “unassuming” – until she did her first scene. “It was like, <em>What just happened?</em> It was electric in the room. She seemed timid, but she definitely wasn’t. When she spoke, there was a wisdom. I kind of adopted her as my little sister from that day. There was something about her that I just wanted to protect,” he chuckles.</p>
<p>“It felt like she had a maturity beyond her years,” says director Steve McQueen. He says Wright’s “integrity and straightforwardness” were the qualities that stood out to him when casting her as Jones- LeCointe, a woman he describes as “resolute and uncompromising”.</p>
<p>To help prepare her for the role, McQueen put the actress in touch with the real Jones-LeCointe. “I was like, ‘Can I meet her? Is she comfortable to meet?’” Wright admits to being “a bit scared” on meeting the now 75-year-old, arriving early at a café in Finsbury Park. “She had this rucksack on, and she was shorter than I had imagined. We hugged and found a seat at the back. I got to ask her questions. I didn’t want to be too intrusive. I basically made it clear that I wasn’t trying to be her in the sense of how she crossed her legs or how she scratched her hair... I wanted to capture her spirit – the spirit of someone who believed in something bigger for her people, someone who had something to say, and something to contribute.”</p>
<p>During the Mangrove Nine trial, Jones-LeCointe and Darcus Howe (played in the film by Kirby) represented themselves in court, a strategy coordinated by the defendants that was key to their winning of the case. I tell her I’m amazed we weren’t taught about this in school. “Why would they want to teach you about nine people who got off from the Metropolitan police? About the first time race was discussed in the Old Bailey?” asks Wright, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(My friends) have the benefit of exploring (dating apps) without somebody going, ‘Oh my God! Wakanda Forever!’” – Letitia Wright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones-LeCointe isn’t the first activist Wright has played. At the age of 12, her first-ever theatre role was NAACP official and civil rights icon Rosa Parks. “You’re like, ‘OK, this changes everything,’” she says earnestly. “I can’t play Rosa Parks and then do something silly.” Her own political education started with her father, a chef who gave her children’s books about Black inventors and played Bob Marley and Dennis Brown records at home. He had an idea of what they weren’t teaching her about at school. “He was like, ‘I know that no one is going to take the time to tell you about how amazing you are as a Black woman, so I’m going to have to purposefully put this book in your hands and hope that you will read it,’ and I did,” she says. As for the music? “Hearing the lyrics of people fighting for liberation, and freedom, and fairness, and equality plants a crazy seed in your head very early on.”</p>
<p>Wright’s hope is that <em>Mangrove</em> plants the same seed in its viewers. “I hope it moves us forward to that place where you don’t have to wake up and see a police officer put his foot on someone’s throat. To never have to go back there again. That would be the hope,” she says, keeping her voice level. The global fight for Black liberation is an ongoing one, though the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the spring brought a renewed energy to the conversation around police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. I ask how she feels about <em>Mangrove</em>, a film about racism and police brutality, being released in the context of this year’s events. “I remember Steve called to give me the news about the film being selected for Cannes. (<em>Due to Covid-19, the festival was cancelled.</em>) Then he said (of the BLM protests), ‘It feels like life imitating art and art imitating life.’ I felt sad that he even had to say those words,” she replies.</p>
<p>“I’m just tired really, tired of constantly having to say the same things,” Wright continues. “We said it beforehand for years, and then you say it again, and then you say it again, and then you say it again, and then you’re in <em>Mangrove</em>, and then you’re in the street demonstrating. You say it again, you say it again, and then you have Stephen Lawrence, and then you’re saying it again. I don’t know what else to say. Around the world, we really have to get it together. It’s too much to bear.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Despite <em>Mangrove</em>’s weightiness, Malachi Kirby hopes that people will connect with the seam of joy running through the film. McQueen punctuates the courtroom scenes with the electricity of everyday life, paying lavish attention to steel pans, dancing, laughter, steaming pots of curried fish, goat and mutton. Kirby emphasises the importance of not losing a sense of self, celebration, and joy in the midst of injustice. “To still dance, to still sing, is a form of strength and defiance. I think it speaks to generations before us and how we’ve gotten through things,” he says, describing the mood on set as celebratory. They would sing every day – “Blood and Fire” by Niney the Observer, according to Wright, inspired by its use in Franco Rosso and John La Rose’s 1973 short documentary “Mangrove Nine”. When filming the street party scenes, even the famously sombre McQueen got involved. “He was brukking out on the floor!” giggles Kirby.</p>
<p>“We forget how the little things can bring so much joy. Always in the little things,” Wright wrote on Twitter in June. She tells me British poet and activist Akala said something similar in a recent Instagram live – that “we need to promote more Black joy”. Joy, for Wright, is her little sisters – and her parents, who she admits spoil her. “If they come to my apartment, they cook for me. I’m a Guyanese kid who came to Britain, so I can do a really dope spaghetti bolognese, but the Guyanese stuff... the curries, the roti!” she swoons.</p>
<p>Last night, Wright was at dinner with a friend, and they were discussing relationships. They were talking about how to be a successful woman while looking for love at the same time. I ask if that’s something she thinks about often. “Of course, I’m going to be 27!” she says. “I just need to meet the one person that’s for me and that’s it. Done. I don’t need to do all that website stuff.” Unlike her, the friend, another actress, is on the apps. “She has the benefit of exploring without somebody going, ‘Oh my God! Wakanda Forever!’ She doesn’t have that problem,” she groans.</p>	<figure>

<p>“Everybody’s like, ‘Hey, you have successful friends – they’re cute’, and I’m like, ‘Yeah, but they’re dating every girl they fancy,” Wright continues. “You don’t want that. Like oh, dang – you’ve got five chicks? I’m not trying to be number six. I’m just trusting that I will find the person that’s for me when the time is right. My friends have told me I’m too passive. They’re like, ‘You need to do something about it.’”</p>
<p>It’s probably useful for people to know that you’re available, I offer. “That’s true,” she concedes. “But then I have a whole thing about not wanting my heart to be broken. You can’t enjoy your blessings when you go through that,” she counters, hinting that this has happened before. In the meantime, she’s amusingly sanguine about dating. “This is what God wants me to do, so if you’re mature enough to see that, great, amazing, cool, let’s go. But if you’re not – don’t hit my DMs. Just don’t.”</p>
<p>Opposite what used to be The Mangrove is a record store. The shopfront of People’s Sound Records is painted red, yellow and green. Wright has seen it in the documentaries that she’s watched, and wants to go in. “Hey, good afternoon, sorry to bother you,” she says, striding up to the counter. “I wanted to know, how long has this establishment been here?”</p>
<p>The owner saunters over from a room in the back. “This one has been here in this home from 1988,” he says.</p>
<p>“We did a TV show about the Mangrove Nine, and I remember in the documentaries always seeing a reggae shop on this road,” she tells him. “It’s called <em>Small Axe</em>, on BBC One. And then the first film is called <em>Mangrove</em>, which is about a man from down the road,” Wright continues, shyly gesturing across the street.</p>
<p>“I look forward to it coming out,” he nods.</p>
<p><em>Mangrove is out on BBC One now</em></p>

<p>Despite being a long road through hell, 2020 is <em>almost</em> over. On the plus side, it’s now only 37 days until Christmas (polite reminder to start buying gifts for your loved ones). </p>
<p>If you know any <a href="/make-up">make-up</a> fanatics, <a href="/Kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> is making a big case for spending your money on <a href="/Kylie-cosmetics">Kylie Cosmetics</a> – announcing the launch of a <em>Grinch</em>-themed make-up collection that drops tomorrow (Nov 19).</p>
<p>”I have so many memories of reading <em>How The Grinch Stole Christmas</em> every year during the holidays, and now my daughter loves it,” Jenner says on the unlikely pairing between the make-up mogul and our green and hairy Christmas-hating fiend. </p>
<p>The gigantic collection comprises 19 products, including a 16-shade eyeshadow palette, lipsticks, liquid eyeliner, blush, highlighter, and a <em>Grinch</em>-themed lip kit (naturally). Created in collaboration with Dr Seuss, the packaging for the collection features original illustrations, including a menacing pair of Grinch eyes on the palette. </p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Lana Del Rey addresses backlash for wearing a mesh mask at a book signing</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The singer has also responded to rumours about who she voted for in the 2020 US presidential election</h3>

<p>Last month (October 2) <a href="/lana-del-rey">Lana Del Rey</a> held a surprise book signing at a Barnes amp; Noble bookshop in Los Angeles, where she chatted and posed for photos with fans. The singer was primarily there to promote her recent poetry collection, <a href="/music/article/49939/1/lana-del-rey-releases-poetry-album-violet-bent-backwards-over-the-grass"><em>Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass</em></a>, but the book was soon overshadowed by backlash on social media, with critics and fans alike <a href="/music/article/50667/1/lana-del-rey-criticised-for-wearing-mesh-mask-at-book-signing">questioning her choice of face covering</a>.</p>
<p>The mask Del Rey had chosen appeared to be made of mesh (which is thought to do little to stop the spread of coronavirus, due to the fact it’s a porous material) and was previously seen in a cover shoot for <em>Interview</em>.</p>
<p>Del Rey’s sister, Chuck Grant, claimed that Del Rey had “tested negative” for <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> before the event. Grant also said that they remained six feet away from other attendees at all times, despite the fact that several photos show fans standing much closer.</p>
<p>“Please wear a real mask. I’m begging you be safe,” read one comment under images shared by the singer on social media. Another user wrote: “Please tell me that there's some sort of see through/sheer, woven (or clear plastic?) liner under the mesh?”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lana Del Rey meets with fans at surprise book signing event for her collection of poetry, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VBBOTG?src=hashamp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VBBOTG</a>, in LA. 📚 <a href="https://t.co/t2H7hYAvhz">pic.twitter.com/t2H7hYAvhz</a></p>mdash; Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1312209620551622656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p>Now, Del Rey has personally responded to the criticism provoked by her choice of mask, commenting under an article in <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/lana-del-rey-wore-mesh-mask-what-now"><em>Michigan Daily</em></a> that seems to suggest the response from fans – and how it could potentially affect her career – is symptomatic of “cancel culture”.</p>
<p>“Great article,” Del Rey responds via Twitter, claiming that the mask did in fact have “plastic on the inside”. </p>
<p>“They’re commonly sewn in by stylists these days,” she adds. “I don’t generally respond to articles because I don’t care. But there ya go. Same goes for everyone’s masks in my video. I’m lucky enough to have a team of people who can do that.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6emupIwcLM">pic.twitter.com/6emupIwcLM</a></p>mdash; Lana Del Rey (@LanaDelRey) <a href="https://twitter.com/LanaDelRey/status/1328613115462701057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p>While she’s at it, Del Rey has also taken aim at other controversies spread on social media, including a rumour that she supported <a href="/Donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> in the 2020 US presidential election. “Again not that I believe it’s anyone’s business at all,” she writes, “but I made it clear who I voted for.” In 2018, Del Rey <a href="/music/article/41629/1/lana-del-rey-says-kanye-west-trump-support-is-loss-for-the-culture">called</a> Trump’s election “a loss for the country” and <a href="/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>’s support for him “a loss for the culture”. Meanwhile, she’s been vocal – <a href="/life-culture/article/51022/1/lady-gaga-lizzo-cardi-b-timothee-chalamet-beyonce-react-biden-us-election-win">among other celebrities</a> – in celebrating Joe Biden’s election win this year.</p>
<p>“And I don’t glamorize tough relationships,” she writes, having <a href="/music/article/49330/1/lana-del-rey-addresses-backlash-for-instagram-post-double-standards-in-music">already addressed</a> accusations of glamorising abuse in the past. “Relationships can just be tough. Period. Every other singer sings about the same damn thing. Always have, Probably always will.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not everyone is convinced by Del Rey’s explanation for the mask. Several replies to her comments raise suspicions about whether the mesh mask had a plastic layer, based on how it appears in the video. One comment also questions why it took her so long to respond to the controversy, to which she replies: “Bro I’m working on 2 albums and excitedly and happily donating a million dollars throughout the nation.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>In February this year, <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> was spotted wearing a colourful, patchwork cardigan during a rehearsal for <em>The Today Show</em>, finished off with a pearl necklace. If you were on <a href="/tiktok">TikTok</a> at the time, then you’ll know that shortly after that the aptly-named <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/harrystylescardigan">#HarryStylesCardigan</a> challenge took the platform by storm, as fans attempted to crochet their own approximations of the <a href="/jw-anderson">JW Anderson</a> design.</p>
<p>In fact, the challenge trended to the extent that it ended up making its way back to Anderson a couple of months later, who subsequently <a href="/fashion/article/49694/1/harry-styles-crochet-patchwork-cardigan-tiktok-trend-jw-anderson-diy-fashion">shared a helping hand</a> for those looking to craft the look themselves, in the form of a downloadable pattern and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-igQBecLdKIamp;ab_channel=JWAnderson">YouTube tutorial</a>. </p>
<p>“I am so impressed and incredibly humbled by this trend and everyone knitting the cardigan,” the designer wrote at the time. “I really wanted to show our appreciation so we are sharing the pattern with everyone. Keep it up!”</p>
<p>Now though, the cardigan has reached even greater heights, with the announcement that it is set to be immortalised in a museum collection. </p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="/Victoria-and-albert">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> has requested the knitwear for its permanent collection, as an emblem of the DIY creativity sparked by <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> lockdowns this year, and of a more general move towards more eco-friendly practices in fashion.</p>
<p>Take another look at Styles wearing the now-iconic cardigan (and Anderson’s wholehearted embrace of the trend it began) below.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><a href="/Ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> has released the video for “34+35”, a track from her most recent album, <a href="/music/article/50925/1/new-music-friday-5-albums-to-stream-this-week"><em>Positions</em></a>.</p>
<p>The visuals – first <a href="/music/article/51101/1/ariana-grande-hits-the-science-lab-in-a-teaser-for-her-3435-video-positions">teased</a> late last week – come courtesy of “<a href="/music/article/27063/1/drake-releases-hotline-bling-video">Hotline Bling</a>” filmmaker <a href="/director-x">Director X</a>, and feature Grande leading a team of scientists in a lab. The singer also doubles as the robot they’re trying to bring to life.</p>
<p>Ariana Grande has previously called the lyrics to the track “absolutely absurd”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0n_aqCcTVkamp;feature=youtu.beamp;ab_channel=ZachSangShow">explaining</a>: “We heard the strings that sounded so Disney and orchestral and full and pure, and I was just like: ‘yo, what is the dirtiest possible, most opposing lyric that we could write to this?’”</p>
<p>The track was released along with <em>Positions</em> October 30. A <a href="/music/article/50862/1/ariana-grande-is-the-president-in-her-new-video-for-positions">video for the title track</a> from the album sees Grande take on the role of president, signing papers in the Oval Office, and hosting press conferences.</p>
<p>Grande has also recently taken the stage alongside <a href="/thundercat">Thundercat</a> at Adult Swim Festival, to <a href="/music/article/51101/1/ariana-grande-hits-the-science-lab-in-a-teaser-for-her-3435-video-positions">perform a version</a> of the latter’s 2015 track “Them Changes”. “It feels like Ariana and I are forever connected through Mac (Miller),” Thundercat says, referring to their performance as: “part of the healing process.”</p>

<p>President Andrzej Duda’s recent re-election has proved disastrous for <a href="/tag/poland">Poland</a>’s human rights. A right-wing conservative Catholic, the president has repeatedly and emphatically denounced the promotion of LGBTQ+ rights as an “<a href="/politics/article/49844/1/how-lgbtq-rights-are-under-threat-in-poland-and-how-to-help-fight-it">ideology more destructive than communism</a>”.  As he continues to push his deeply homophobic agenda and many regional parliaments declare their districts “LGBT-free zones”, Poland is now the <a href="https://www.ilga-europe.org/rainboweurope/2020">worst-performing country</a> in the EU where LGBTQ+ rights are concerned. </p>
<p><em>More Radical Empathy</em>, a project by photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rebeccazephyrthomas/">Rebecca Thomas</a>, is a poignant and inspiring series of portraits of activists from the global queer community in London, bearing heartfelt slogans of resistance against the abhorrent political climate undermining the safety of Poland’s LGBTQ+ citizens.</p>
<p>Having attended a protest outside the Polish Embassy in London this July, Thomas was deeply moved by her conversations with the protesters. “The way that these activists were drawing attention to their basic humanity was pretty powerful,” she recalls<em>. </em><em>More Radical Empathy</em> evolved as a series of portraits of the extraordinary people she met outside the Polish Embassy that day. </p>
<p>“I have spent a lot of time with the LGTBQ community here in London. And that community was my safe place for most of my twenties and thirties. Even though I'm a cis, straight woman, I always felt welcomed. And I feel that I should use whatever tools I have to give back to a community that's given me so much,” the New Zealand-born photographer tells Dazed. “If you believe in the same rights for everyone, you should support those who aren't currently enjoying those rights, this goes for any group that is oppressed.” </p>

<p>Despite not being able to go out, 2020 has been jammed full of tracks that dare you not to run to your nearest dancefloor. Making it even more difficult is <a href="/shygirl">Shygirl</a>, the London-based rapper who has captured fans with her sexy beats and even sexier (dare we say, sluttier) lyrics. </p>
<p>After releasing “Freak” – which you might have heard at the latest Savage x Fenty show – Shygirl’s latest release “SLIME” is the latest single from her upcoming EP <em>ALIAS. </em>Creatively, the release focuses on four alter egos – Bae, Bovine, Baddie, and Bonk. </p>
<p>Collaborating with make-up artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monaleannemakeup/">Mona Leanne</a>, Shygirl transforms into Bonk for a tutorial with Dazed Beauty. “I have always been drawn to how dramatic the clown make-up has been and I did it really early on for my video ‘GUSH’,” she says. “Just to accentuate this idea of duplicitous moods. My face is saying one thing but like inside is saying another, or whatever, you know, like the face that you show someone.”</p>
<p>Using NARS, Pat McGrath Labs, Nyx, and YSL Beauty, watch the full tutorial below and read Shygirl’s cover interview from the autumn/winter 2020 issue of Dazed <a href="/music/article/51076/1/shygirl-interview-autumnwinter-2020-issue-alias">here</a>. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<h1 class="fl-title">Inside films’ most flamboyant, forgotten interior spaces</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">@celluloidhomes looks at decor throughout cinema and offers followers a bespoke ‘film prescription’ as an antidote to lockdown anxiety</h3>

	<figure>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/celluloidhomes/">@celluloidhomes</a> is the Instagram account surveying the history of cinema from the perspective of films’ interior spaces. From grand midcentury modernist villas in Capri to sparsely furnished apartments in impoverished, inner-city neighbourhoods, @celluloidhomes draws your attention beyond the immediate action of a movie and diverts your eye to the often-overlooked rooms in which the story is unfolding; the decor and details which hugely affect our understanding and experience of the film but so often go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Not only does @celluloidhomes create the opportunity to revisit and reconsider familiar movies in a new way, but it’s also a really rich resource for discovering films you may not have yet encountered. Featuring a mixture of arthouse and cult cinema alongside more mainstream movies, it’s a great place to turn for ideas if you’re paralysed by Netflix-ennui (the condition of extreme malaise that settles over you when you’re scrolling hopelessly through Netflix and you suspect you’ve exhausted the whole site and it no longer has anything new to offer you).</p>
<p>In addition to the range of the movies featured on the account, its creator, Emma Paterson, also offers followers a unique on-request film prescription service. Depending on how you’re feeling (or how you’d <em>like</em> to feel) Paterson will provide you with a bespoke list of films for your personal viewing, designed to enhance or transform your mood. An ardent believer in what she describes as the “simultaneously transporting and grounding” possibilities of cinema, she began offering this free service back in the first lockdown and found people really responded to the idea of being recommended a viewing list. “Prescriptions are mainly based on what I have seen,” she explains. “I try to imagine myself into the mood of the person and I ask myself ‘What would I feel like watching?’”</p>

<p><strong>How did @celluloidhomes begin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>I love cinema and I’ve always been interested in the small details held in interior spaces on-screen. I began by thinking about a number of contemporary films in which luxurious, breath-taking house takes centre stage – almost as an additional character in the film. So I started by sharing images of the Schaffer Residence used in <a href="/tag/tom-ford">Tom Ford</a>’s <a href="/artsandculture/article/6465/1/a-single-man"><em>A Single Man</em></a> and the Villa Necchi Campiglio in <a href="/tag/luca-guadagnino">Luca Guadagnino</a>’s <em>I Am Love</em>. Other good examples would probably be the modernist homes in films such as <a href="/fashion/article/33563/1/watch-a-clip-from-tom-fords-new-film-nocturnal-animals"><em>Nocturnal Animals</em></a> and <em>Arrival</em>. But I soon realised that almost every on-screen home, however prosaic, is both narratively and aesthetically interesting – not just the homes of the moneyed. I decided to expand the view, first by revisiting some of my favourite films and looking again at homes I perhaps previously ignored.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since childhood, watching a film in the cinema has felt simultaneously transporting and grounding. I can’t quite explain it but, as an experience, it expands and anchors me at once. I can’t imagine two better emotional states to experience in a year of chaos, anxiety, and restriction” – Emma Paterson</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Could you tell us more about your interest in film interiors? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>It’s maybe easier to use someone else’s words to answer this: film director Douglas Sirk said, ‘I considered that the homes that people live in exactly describe their lives.’ <a href="/tag/pedro-almodovar">Almodóvar</a> offers something similar, saying, ‘I think décor says a lot about someone’s social position, their taste, their sensibility, their work.’ As an extension of that, I would say that my interest in film interiors is really just an interest in people and story. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>What kind of decor are you drawn to? Please talk us through some of your all-time favourite on-screen interiors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>I would be lying if I said the flamboyant houses – like Casa Malaparte in <a href="/tag/jean-luc-godard">Godard</a>’s <em>Contempt</em> – weren’t among my favourites, but I’m also very partial to the small apartments in which characters live alone. There are fascinating continuities between the vulnerable New York apartments lived in by Bree (played by Jane Fonda) in Pakula’s <em>Klute</em>, and Frannie in <a href="/tag/jane-campion">Campion</a>’s <em>In The Cut</em>, for example. And I <em>love </em>Scottie and Midge’s apartments in <a href="/tag/alfred-hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>’s <em>Vertigo</em>. Often the bathroom becomes a symbolically rich space: think of Chiron as a boy in the bathroom in Jenkins’ <a href="/tag/moonlight"><em>Moonlight</em></a> – the lonely bar of yellow soap in the wall! Or the famous scene in the bathroom of what I imagine to be an upper east side apartment in <a href="/tag/jonathan-glazer">Glazer</a>’s Birth: white, eerily pristine, like a bathroom in a hotel. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>Could you share with us a bit more about the film prescriptions? How did you come to offer this service? And how does it work? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>This was a service I began offering partly out of boredom and anxiety at the start of the first lockdown. But I found that people really liked it and, in fact, searching for the films felt very meditative. Given everyone’s moods this year have been intensified x100, I generally ask people to talk to me about their mood and then I try to prescribe a set of films suited to it. Alternatively, I ask people what mood they would <em>rather</em> be in, and try to identify two or three films that might get them there.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

                </div>
<p><strong>How do you put together a prescription? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Prescriptions are mainly based on what I have seen: I try to imagine myself into the mood of the person and I ask myself ‘What would I feel like watching?’ I’ve received some funny requests, including ‘I want to feel erotic‘, or just ‘chrome and power suits, please.’</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell a lot about a person by their list of favourite films? Is it quite revealing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Yes and no. Often, people’s favourite films will be underlined by a lot of nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways do you think watching movies can be beneficial? And how can watching the right films help us through these trying times? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Since childhood, watching a film in the cinema has felt simultaneously transporting and grounding. I can’t quite explain it but, as an experience, it expands and anchors me at once. I can’t imagine two better emotional states to experience in a year of chaos, anxiety, and restriction.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>What’s your day job? Would you like to run @celluloidhomes as a living? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>I am a literary agent by day, film doctor – ha! – by night. I wonder what it would be like to spend every waking hour on @celluloidhomes! I can’t quite imagine it. I suppose in another life I might have tried my hand at cinematography or set design.</p>
<p><strong>Having recently lost their respective jobs as leader of the free world and chief advisor to the PM, Donald Trump and Dominic Cummings both probably have a lot more time on their hands whilst also possibly feeling dejected and struggling with issues of self-worth.

<p>It’s almost December, which means one thing: <a href="https://twitter.com/bimbofication/status/1159967906656149504">Christian Girl Autumn</a> is, sadly, coming to an end. Determined to go out with a bang, <a href="/beauty/tag/dorian-electra">Dorian Electra</a> has dropped the music video for “F The World”, in which they transform themselves into everyone’s fave basic bitch.</p>
<p>Cosplaying for the season, Electra can be seen twirling for the cameras in a white beanie, pink scarf, and skinny jeans. Carrying a Starbucks pumpkin spice latte (PSL) and a side bag, and rocking a wavy ombre hairstyle, the musician cradles a pumpkin and does the infamous <a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/envision/hand-holding-couple-india-photos/1029999">walking-away-while-holding-hands</a> pose.</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Electra changes into tiny denim shorts, and twerks against a ladder filled with apples. In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHoXycin0i3/">Instagram thirst trap</a> after releasing the video, Electra said: “Feelin so #blessed by y’all’s enormous outpouring of love for my new music video for ‘F The World’! lt;2 🤗🍁☕️🍂  Thanks for lettin me be myself, sing my heart out and celebrate this beautiful season!”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="aLnVLo6uxqo"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aLnVLo6uxqo" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>In honour of the video, and their new persona, Electra has also dropped the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_pwVUVXDrY">Perfect PSL Autumn Make-Up Tutorial</a>’. The video sees Electra and their friend on livestream, offering viewers a step-by-step guide to a beauty look inspired by the “fragility of nature” during fall.</p>
<p>Over the hour and a half, Electra continues to cosplay as the Christian Girl Autumn stereotype, dropping clichés like, ‘Live, Laugh, Love’, claiming church is “a state of mind”, and basically being insufferable.</p>
<p>The artist later <a href="https://twitter.com/DORIANELECTRA/status/1327707748398632961">tweeted</a> a (presumably fake) voucher for a free Starbucks PSL, complete with a photo of Electra from the “F The World” video and the caption: “Let’s celebrate! 🤗🍁☕”</p>

<p>In July, <a href="/tag/megan-thee-stallion">Megan Thee Stallion</a> revealed that she was <a href="/music/article/49835/1/megan-thee-stallion-says-shes-in-recovery-from-a-gunshot-wound-tory-lanez-arrest">recovering from gunshot wounds</a> after being shot in the feet during an altercation. The following month, the rapper alleged that <a href="/tag/tory-lanez">Tory Lanez</a> was the one <a href="/music/article/50201/1/megan-thee-stallion-says-tory-lanez-shot-her">responsible for the shooting</a>, addressing him directly in an <a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1296642764092866560">Instagram Live</a>. “You shot me, and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and shit,” she said. “Stop lying. Why lie?”</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/megan-thee-stallion-rapper-of-the-year-2020"><em>GQ</em></a>, Megan has further opened up about that night, telling the publication that Lanez attempted to buy her silence. “(At this point) I’m really scared,” she said. “Police are just killing everybody for no reason, and I’m thinking, ‘I can’t believe you even think I want to take some money. Like, you just shot me’.”</p>
<p>A lawyer for Lanez (real name Daystar Peterson) has denied the accusation, telling <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9484719/megan-thee-stallion-details-tory-lanez-shooting-bribe/"><em>Billboard</em></a>: “Mr Peterson has never offered money to any witness for their silence or for any other reason. Any reports to the contrary are false.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="aOuwH0nuStY"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aOuwH0nuStY" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>Ever since Megan made the accusation against Lanez, a number of stories about the incident have emerged. In September, <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/09/09/megan-thee-stallion-shooting-tory-lanez-text-apology-too-drunk/"><em>TMZ</em></a> <a href="/music/article/50391/1/tory-lanez-told-megan-thee-stallion-he-was-drunk-after-alleged-shooting">exposed a text</a> which Lanez sent to Megan just hours after the alleged shooting. “Shit should never have happened and I can’t change what I did,” it read. “I just feel horrible. Cuz I genuinely just got too drunk.”</p>
<p>Two weeks later, Lanez released his fifth studio album, <em>DAYSTAR</em>, which <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/tory-lanez-addresses-megan-thee-stallion-on-new-album-daystar/"><em>Pitchfork</em></a> described as “essentially a concept album” about the shooting. On the album, he mentions Megan by name, claims he was “framed” and is “innocent”, and sings, <em>“How the fuck you get shot in your foot, don’t hit no bones or tendons”</em>. Many music critics refused to review the album, calling it “<a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2020/09/tory-lanez-daystar-much-worse-than-a-terrible-album">a project too contemptible to be evaluated on any musical scale</a>”, while <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/tory-lanez-daystar-album/"><em>Highsnobiety</em></a> announced they would no longer cover Lanez’s work.</p>
<p>In October, Lanez was <a href="/music/article/50715/1/tory-lanez-is-charged-with-felony-assault-in-megan-thee-stallion-shooting">charged with felony assault</a>, and, if convicted, faces a possible maximum sentence of 22 years and eight months in prison. Lanez was set to be arraigned on October 13, but it has since been delayed until tomorrow (November 18).</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>Megan has spoken a lot about the incident in the months that have followed, particularly addressing the <a href="/music/article/50761/1/megan-thee-stallion-champions-black-women-in-new-york-times-op-ed">importance of protecting Black women</a>. In an op-ed for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/opinion/megan-thee-stallion-black-women.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, Megan addresses the fact that violence against women “happens because too many men treat all women as objects”, asserting that “the issue is even more intense for Black women, who struggle against stereotypes and are seen as angry or threatening when we try to stand up for ourselves and our sisters”. She adds: “Black women are still constantly disrespected and disregarded in so many areas of life.”</p>
<p>In the midst of the drama, Megan has been continuing with her music, dropping the iconic video for “<a href="/music/article/50056/1/watch-cardi-b-and-megan-thee-stallion-s-music-video-for-new-single-wap">WAP</a>”, <a href="/music/article/50209/1/megan-thee-stallion-is-holding-a-live-virtual-concert-jaquel-knight-coronavirus">holding a virtual concert</a>, and <a href="/music/article/51084/1/megan-thee-stallion-announces-her-debut-album-good-news">announcing her debut album</a>, <em>Good News</em>, which is set to arrive on Friday (November 20). The rapper also <a href="/music/article/50658/1/megan-thee-stallion-demands-justice-for-breonna-taylor-on-snl">appeared on <em>Saturday Night Live</em></a> – where she used her performance to demand justice for <a href="/breonna-taylor">Breonna Taylor</a> – and <a href="/music/article/50713/1/megan-thee-stallion-announces-dont-stop-scholarship-for-women-of-colour">launched a global scholarship</a> fund to provide $10,000 bursaries to female students of colour.</p>]]>

<p>It’s been almost a year since the <a href="/tag/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> first emerged, subsequently sending the world into lockdown and immeasurably altering our everyday lives. After months of working from home, avoiding friends, and generally being depressed AF, it seems there could be light at the end of the tunnel as two COVID-19 vaccines are on their way.</p>
<p>Last week (November 9), developers Pfizer and BioNTech <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54873105">announced a vaccine</a> that can prevent more than 90 per cent of people from getting coronavirus. Hot on their heels, US company Moderna <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54902908">revealed its vaccine</a> yesterday (November 16), which is said to offer nearly 95 per cent protection.</p>
<p>As it turns out, we have an unexpected celeb to thank for the latter. According to the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483"><em>New England Journal of Medicine</em></a>, <a href="/tag/dolly-parton">Dolly Parton</a> provided funding for the crucial research that led to Moderna’s breakthrough.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I want everyone to know that Dolly Parton gave us Buffy the tv series, the song 9 to 5, Dollywood, and of course the Covid vaccine. <a href="https://t.co/mCPB3QlCpZ">https://t.co/mCPB3QlCpZ</a></p>mdash; Kevidently (@Kevidently) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kevidently/status/1328552885433622532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p>A preliminary report reveals that the Dolly Parton COVID-19 Research Fund made a donation to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, whose work inspired Moderna’s research model for the effective vaccine. As reported by <a href="https://www.clashmusic.com/news/dolly-parton-helped-realise-the-covid-19-vaccine"><em>CLASH</em></a> (via <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanCohn/status/1328490899853160449">Jonathan Cohn</a> on Twitter), the country singer donated $1 million (£755k). </p>
<p>Parton’s contribution was <a href="https://www.vumc.org/coronavirus/latest-news/dolly-parton-makes-generous-gift-advance-covid-19-research-vanderbilt">originally announced</a> by the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in April. The 74-year-old reportedly gifted the money in honour of her longtime friend, Naji Abumrad, a professor of surgery. Speaking on <em>NBC</em>’s Today Show, Parton said: “What better time right now, we need this. I felt like this was the time for me to open my heart and my hand, and try to help.”</p>
<p>The president and CEO of Vanderbilt University Medical Center said at the time: “Dolly’s amazing generosity is a source of inspiration and will have a lasting impact on the battle against COVID-19. She cares so much about helping others and we are very grateful for her ongoing support. These funds will help us complete promising research that can benefit millions in their battle with the virus.”</p>
<p>So, there you have it folks, Dolly Parton helped cure coronavirus.</p>]]>

<p><a href="/tag/dua-lipa">Dua Lipa</a> has taken to Instagram to announce the guest appearance of <a href="/tag/fka-twigs">FKA twigs</a> in her upcoming livestream event, Studio 2054, set to take place on November 27.</p>
<p>Lipa shared an Instagram post yesterday (November 16) of an in-studio image of the two singers sitting side by side, with the caption: “So excited to announce that (FKA twigs) will be joining us for STUDIO 2054 a very special performance!!!”</p>
<p>Announced last month, Studio 2054 will see the singer perform “a brand new multi-dimensional live experience”, featuring tracks from her <a href="/music/article/50276/1/new-music-friday-albums-to-hear-this-week">recent album</a> “Future Nostalgia”, remix album “Club Future Nostalgia”, and her self-titled debut album.</p>
<p>The event will see the singer “move through custom-built sets, surreal tv shows, roller discos, ecstatic raves, trashy rocker hangouts, voguing ballrooms, and diva style dressing rooms” according to a press release.</p>
<p>Joining twigs will be a cast of superstar guests that are yet to be revealed – until then, watch this space and read our <a href="/music/article/48960/1/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-quarantine-interview">interview with Dua here</a>.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>Lisa Rinna is an icon. From the moment she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srdXm9FCLeY">smashed that wine glass on the table</a> in a restaurant in Amsterdam – let’s <em>not </em>talk about the husband – it was decided. </p>
<p>So, fans of the <em>Real Housewives</em> star will be pleased to know that they can take one step closer to looking just like their idol with the launch of <a href="https://rinnabeauty.com">Rinna Beauty</a>. </p>
<p>Focusing on lips (obviously), the launch features three kits in nude, nude-pink, and nude-coral, each containing a lipstick, lip gloss, and liner. “I’ve always joked about being the lip pioneer, I’ve always wanted to do something with these lips. ” Rinna tells <em><a href="https://www.allure.com/story/lisa-rinna-beauty-lip-products-interview">Allure</a></em>. “I finally feel like we’re getting to do it and have fun and have a sense of humor, and really bring quality items that I just absolutely love, that my heart and soul are in and part of.”</p>
<p>The debut launch is just the beginning of Rinna Beauty, so stay tuned to see what comes next. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><em>Taken from <a href="/the-autumnwinter-2020-issue">the autumn/winter 2020 issue</a> of Dazed. You can pre-order a copy of our latest issue <a href="https://boutiquemags.com/collections/frontpage/products/dazed">here</a></em></p>
<p>Alter egos have long permeated pop music – a conceptual career narrative for Bowie as Ziggy Stardust, Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce and Nicki Minaj’s ricochet from turned-up valley girl to gun-toting gangster in the space of a tune. There is a lineage, a blueprint for an artist’s dramatis personae. Now, <a href="/tag/shygirl">Shygirl</a>’s bbz have entered the chat – Baddie, Bonk, Bovine and Bae. Think Bratz dolls meet Hatsune Miku, cast in a Hype Williams video, and dressed to match each character’s personality in Mugler, Mowalola, Charlotte Knowles and Asai.</p>
<p>The London born-and-bred musician’s new EP <em>ALIAS</em> is her most ambitious project yet. It’s a hydra-headed origin story for the artist, in which these four personalities weave in and out to scintillate, seduce and fuck it all up. “Your art and your words have the power to build and tear down worlds of your own making,” says Shy. “I am my own main character, heroine and muse.”</p>
<p>Speaking over Zoom from home between a photoshoot and studio time, Shygirl describes each persona’s particular flair, counting them with her ruby-red stiletto nails: Bae is the throwback to the aspirational girls with attitude on south east London estates she saw growing up; Bovine is the queen bee with an ice-cool air; Bonk is playful and coquettish. Baddie is quintessentially Shy – seething yet insouciant, revelling in narcissism, sexually liberated, and rubbing your face in it.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“I’ve had time to really delve into what Shygirl is,” she shares. “I mean, right now, it’s all of me. I live in the headspace day in, day out.” Shygirl has been her moniker since her 2016 debut track, “Want More”, which blossomed from friend and now frequent collaborator Sega Bodega asking her to sing over his sinister industrial beat. With her menacing delivery (<em>“You wanna talk shit? I ain’t into it...wanna fuck fast? I’m into it”</em>) and Sega’s stressy, staccato production, they captured the dancefloors of London’s underground. Shy quit her job at a modelling agency in 2018 to pursue music, and has since powered on with her label <a href="/music/article/40130/1/nuxxe-shygirl-new-ep">NUXXE</a>, founded with Sega, Coucou Chloe and Oklou. That same year, she dropped the venomous <em>Cruel Practice </em>EP, earning a reputation for her dexterous flow over lacerated, horror-pop productions, and she has played shows on just about every continent, soundtracking runways for Savage × Fenty and Mugler.</p>
<p>But who Shygirl is as an artist and person continues to evolve, like her personas, dubbed the ‘Shy Bbz’. “This is still such a new phase of life for me,” she says. “I think it’s necessary, especially as someone presenting themselves publicly, to confirm that you are not one-dimensional – and you may like me today, but you might not like me tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Shy references artists like Björk and Róisín Murphy as cultural touchstones, diaphanous talents who move between genres while retaining strong core identities. “It feels very authentic to me for artists to be amorphous and shed skins – as people we grow. And I don’t like repeating myself, in my work or in conversation,” she says, adding with a sly laugh, “my friends will attest to that.” The world she’s building with <em>ALIAS</em> is both a testament to and lesson in multiplicity, embracing one’s most titillating and toxic traits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your art and your words have the power to build and tear down worlds of your own making” – Shygirl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Across the EP, Shy takes irreverent pleasure in her storytelling, with mile-a-minute raps moving fluidly into distorted, sensual moans, her unwavering drawl magnifying the wit of her explicit, whipsmart lyrics. “<em>I hear they call me shy</em>,” she smirks on first single “FREAK”. On “SLIME”, she traverses what at first seem to be two different voices in a sexual power-play, one misogynist and the other a boss bitch – the twist being that they are both one. Across the shapeshifting beats of producers including <a href="/tag/sophie">SOPHIE</a>, <a href="/tag/arca">Arca</a>, Karma Kid, Happa and Sega, Shygirl plays with perspective: we’re in cahoots with her for one tune, the next we’re prised apart – it’s a collaborative cat-and-mouse.</p>
<p>“I love taking a small situation and stretching the drama out of it,” she says. “I’ve always noted down my thoughts – like, yeah, it could have been poetry but that gets a bit dry, doesn’t it! With music I can play with cadence and pace. I can warp a phrase to mean something totally different just by placement and delivery. It’s a specific kind of high I enjoy from being a smartarse.”</p>
<p>It’s this experimentalism that makes Shygirl so inventive: take 2017’s “CC”, for example, a thumping, woozy track with Sega Bodega about a relationship’s breakdown conceptualised around the sound of her cough, or “FREAK”’s cheeky confession of having your dad on speed dial. The acerbic candour and provocative wordplay have fast become facets of Shy’s act. She’s an artist keen to bust stigmas, asserting her autonomy as both an artist and woman. <em>“Why ride with the devil when I could give you hell?”</em> she sighs on “TWELVE”.</p>
<p>“I find myself taking interactions that have happened and approaching them differently,” says Shy of her songs. “I feel like I’ve asserted more ownership than ever – welcome to my house, I built it from bricks. I’ve taken control – yes, the lyrics are explicit, but it’s in the most visceral, shocking moments that I’m talking more about freedom, identity and agency. Physicality is a universal language. It makes me feel free.”</p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p>“I’m never afraid of making people feel uncomfortable,” she continues, explaining her combative approach. “You’re not getting it on a plate from me. My parents say if you have to question something, be prepared to work for the answer.”</p>
<p>Shygirl is most poised in performance, with her seething sing-talk delivery, acid-coloured wig changes, and the frequent appearance of a luxuriously waved handheld fan. Unlike some peers, she opted out of Club Quarantines and the lockdown livestreams – has she missed the club spaces that influenced the artist she is? “I’ve had time to interrogate what I enjoy about live shows,” she says, “and how performance relates to telling my stories. Shows are about being ‘real’ for people, but actually, my mission as an artist is about creating a fantasy. How do I create a fantasy when I can’t be physically present? Shows are easy in that respect, you’re stimulated by the crowd’s vibe, and they you. This downtime has really helped in crafting a more textural world.” It was in the second month of lockdown that she started making music again. “I think I was scared of what I could write about, sitting at home, but you see what narratives live within you and what you will always need to talk about. It’s a social and creative experiment.”</p>
<p>Amid the UK’s second national lockdown, British nightclubs remain in peril. “They can close physical spaces, but the spirit and the people make this culture,” Shy says. “There’s a desire to be fed, regardless of place. I think that’s felt most by women and queer people, whether you’re going to the club or playing the music. We make the space. We have energy we need to release, let’s just think of those parties in, like... 2028.” London, a city pummelled by iconic club closures, will suffer the brunt of these changes. “There’s an entitlement to culture borne from London, an ego,” she says reflectively, flipping her long blonde hair. “Self-importance is a misgiving, but it’s also liberating as an artist.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“They can close physical spaces, but the spirit and the people make this culture. Women and queer people, whether you’re going to the club or playing the music....we make the space” – Shygirl</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Shygirl is a child of 00s Ramp;B, 90s Eurodance and Myspace deep-dives, and it shows on <em>ALIAS</em> – there’s the gritty production hallmarks of grime and UK rap, and the fug of Benny Benassi-esque beats pulsating throughout, with “TASTY” invoking the peaks of a 90s Fantazia rave. But our conversation is most vibrant when she talks of the sci-fi epics, Meg Cabot coming-of-agers, and Austenian novels of manners she read as a teenager, and their impact on her songwriting. “It’s such fantasy for me!” she says. “Like, I’ve not been to that planet or country manor, but wow, this speaks to me. Language can transport you.” Right now, she is attempting to get through Frank Herbert’s sprawling sci-fi novel <em>Dune</em>, reading it out loud to improve her diction when performing – sounding out the novel’s Houses of Atreides and Harkonnen helps the flow.</p>
<p>The musician is also a keen interlocutor for a dynasty of artists frustrating the parameters of pop. In a set intended for online clubnight HEAV3N, SOPHIE shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXPSe57pOss">unreleased material featuring Shygirl</a>, syncopated, gloopy productions on which she writhes and spits to rapturous responses from an ever-growing fandom. Shygirl and Arca recently united for “unconditional”, a sparse, introspective ode to music as resistance, with proceeds going to organisations fighting for racial equality. She also appeared on Arca’s latest album <em>KiCk i,</em> where the Venezuelan musician herself offers a rebel yell against genre, gender binaries and music’s conventions.</p>
<p>If the <em>ALIAS</em> EP is a multi-sensory experience – “SIREN” needs a slot on the <em>Matrix 4</em> soundtrack, while acid-tongued “TWELVE” would perfectly match a Maddy skewering on <em>Euphoria </em>– its artwork matches up. “I have a broad imagination,” says Shy. “There was no limit, because I actually didn’t <em>know</em> the technical limitations.” The “SLIME” video is like a clandestine session on <em>Second Life.</em> <em>ALIAS</em>’ artwork evokes the body horror of David Cronenberg, a set of eyes peeking from slitted nostrils, the surrounding skin oily and taut like a more-chic Leatherface. “I showed up to a recent shoot, and asked to be painted like a clown. I tell make-up artists to think beyond the boundaries of my face.”</p>	<figure>

	</figure>
<p>After the <em>ALIAS </em>tracks were laid down and lockdown was eased, Shy holidayed in Ibiza with friends – you missed out if you didn’t catch the debaucherous, paradisiacal Instagram stories. During that time, she found some of the stimulation she had missed, and grew closer to Arca. “We’re doing something really personal. Collaborating is about trying to be understood. We thought we knew each other, now we definitely do!” She delights in forging new, surprising connections, citing the union of Karma Kid’s punchy house productions with Arca’s avant-pop on <em>ALIAS</em>. Throughout our conversation, Shy suffixes statements about her development as an artist with praise for her inner sanctum, crediting Sega as her “entryway” into the experimental, and “FREAK” video animator Maurice Andresen and creative director Mischa Notcutt as collaborators that have pushed Shygirl to another level.</p>
<p>With her cohort of painted alter egos, as with her collaborators, she feels deeply connected. “I feel heard, and at my most understood. It’s hard for that not to be a drug you want to keep tapping.”</p>
<p>An album remains a near-future promise, and the next few months will see the continued expansion of the Shygirl universe. Her fans are hard to keep satiated, but Shy is an artist hungry for recognition, drama and limitless artistic possibilities. As we talk, she glides easily across her aliases – the smirk of Bae, Baddie’s tart wit, some playful, almost Austen-esque badinage. It’s in this shapeshifting that she is, paradoxically, at her most centred. This era of Shy is not about discardable sobriquets or creating <em>noms de plume</em> to hide behind; rather, it’s about autonomy in a world that seeks to flatten you, and Shygirl is building her one-woman army. Are you in for the ride? “I’m still shocked that people can make me feel so read and seen, and vice versa,” she muses. “As much as I want to provoke, I want to be understood.”</p>

<p>ICYMI, we just dropped our first autumn/winter 2020 cover, which features <a href="/tag/pa-salieu">Pa Salieu</a>. Dressed in looks by the likes of <a href="/prada">Prada</a>, <a href="/Louis-vuitton">Louis Vuitton</a>, and <a href="/martine-rose">Martine Rose</a>, the rapper is also seen in a stand-out <a href="/Alexander-mcqueen">McQueen</a> mouthpiece dug out from the designer’s archive. </p>
<p>The aluminum jaw bone mouthpiece dates back to McQueen’s SS98 collection, which featured an array of anatomical-inspired jewellery by his long-time friend and collaborator, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/shaunleanejewellery/?hl=en">Shaun Leane</a>. Other pieces in the offering included a spinal corset and a face clamp, which warped the shape of the model’s eyebrows and lips.</p>
<p>The skeletal pieces played into the late designer’s fascination with mortality and served as a reminder of death’s inevitability. The particular momento mori Salieu wears gives the illusion that his skin has been peeled away from his skull, displaying the jaw and the front teeth underneath. </p>
<p>With many of Leane’s pieces shown as part of the Vamp;A’s <a href="/fashion/article/22117/1/five-things-to-expect-from-alexander-mcqueen-savage-beauty"><em>Savage Beauty</em> exhibition</a>, the designer later auctioned off a number of them with the intention of inspiring other creatives. “I want them to be in museums, I want them to be worn,” he explained in a 2017 interview. “I would love in the future, fifty years, one hundred from now, an aspiring jewellery designer, or fashion designer to see them and be inspired like I was at the Vamp;A.”</p>
<p>Read the full interview with Pa Salieu from our <a href="/the-autumnwinter-2020-issue">autumn/winter 2020</a> issue <a href="/music/article/51071/1/pa-salieu-interview-autumnwinter-2020-issue-frontline">here</a>, and revisit our feature on Shaun Leane’s most iconic designs <a href="/fashion/article/38313/1/jeweller-shaun-leane-remembers-his-iconic-mcqueen-pieces">here</a>.</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Byredo Makeup just dropped an eyeshadow palette like no other </h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Connected to three different narratives – Sciomancer, Corporate Colours, and Syren – the 5 Colour Eyeshadow Compact is the latest drop from make-up artist and collaborator Isamaya Ffrench </h3>

<p>Back in October, <a href="/byredo-makeup">Byredo Makeup</a> finally dropped, the beauty arm to the cult fragrance label – founded by Ben Gorham – created in collaboration with Dazed Beauty founder and make-up artist <a href="/isamaya-ffrench">Isamaya Ffrench</a>. </p>
<p>Launching with more classic lipsticks, eyeliner, and mascara, the offering also included the Colour Stick – a creamy, lightweight pigment that can be worn on the eyes, lips, cheeks, wherever. Today, the brand launched a new product to join the line-up: the 5 Colour Eyeshadow Compact. </p>
<p>Coming in three different varieties – Sciomancer, Corporate Colours, and Syren – each palette connects to a narrative to transport the wearer. ”Make-up used to have a kind of repetitive palette but now there is so much freedom in colour and its use, I wanted to design collections that actually connect to a story,” explains Ffrench. </p>
<p>Keeping in line with the other products, the packaging for the compact is a beautiful golden shell, with each pigment in a handy vertical shape for easy swiping and applying. In accompanying images shot by photographer <a href="/Daniel-sannwald">Daniel Sannwald</a>, Ffrench is seen transformed into a mermaid for Syren, Yves Tumour as a dark demon for Sciomancer, and the Medea sisters serve 80s office realness for Corporate Colours. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>The <em>BBC</em>’s The Radiophonic Workshop is in the process of turning the internet into a big musical instrument.</p>
<p>A performance of “Latency” (named after the word used to describe the delay in a transfer of digital data) will take place at an online event on November 22 using a technique inspired by Zoom calls. The band includes composers from the OG Radiophonic Workshop, who created the themes for most shows on the network between the 60s and 90s.</p>
<p>“The idea (of playing the internet) reflected our time,” workshop member Peter Howell told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/15/doctor-whos-sonic-pioneers-to-turn-internet-into-giant-musical-instrument"><em>the Guardian</em></a>. “We’re all subject to the internet now in a way that we never thought we would be.”</p>
<p>The piece is made up of internet delay that’s been stretched from a few milliseconds into several seconds. Instead of playing it all at the same time, the Radiophonic Workshop will play the latency sounds one after another.</p>
<p>“We had the bright idea of using that latency to make a loop of music,” The Radiophonic Workshop’s Bob Earland said. “The sound gets sent to someone, and they add to it, and it keeps going round. So you’re not relying on everyone being on the same clock.”</p>
<p>The performance comes the day before November 23, which is Delia Derbyshire Day, in honour of the Radiophonic Workshop leading member and electronic music pioneer who is credited for bringing early electronic techniques of musique concrete and tape manipulation to a wider audience.</p>
<p>“Latency” will be performed along with other Radiophonic Workshop works on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/RWSProjects" data-link-name="in body link">YouTube channel</a> on November 22 in support of Delia Derbyshire Day and <a href="https://www.thegirlsnetwork.org.uk/our-story" data-link-name="in body link">The Girls’ Network</a>.

<h1 class="fl-title">Matrix 4 wrap party was ‘disguised as a film shoot’ to bypass COVID rules</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The producers reportedly organised a party of 200 people, which they said was part of filming in order to evade Germany’s coronavirus laws</h3>

<p>Although actors and film crews are allowed to return to sets despite the ongoing <a href="/tag/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> pandemic, they’re still not allowed to party together once filming wraps up. Unless, that is, if you disguise the event as a film shoot in order to bypass COVID-19 rules.</p>
<p>This is exactly what the <em>Matrix 4</em> producers did, according to a new report. As told by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/13/matrix-party-disguised-film-shoot-bypass-german-covid-rules-keanu-reeves?new=true"><em>The Guardian</em></a> (via German newspaper <em>Bild</em>), producers Lana and Lilly Wachowski held a party for 200 people at a studio in Brandenburg, code-naming it ‘Icecream Teamevent’. The guests were allegedly invited as ‘extras’ in order to bypass health regulations.</p>
<p>“The mood was exuberant,” a 39-year-old guest told <em>Bild</em>. “Everyone was given a corona PCR test in advance. Everyone needed to come wearing a mask, but many people didn’t wear them as the party wore on. No directional instructions were given, there was no clapperboard and no one was filming.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="vKQi3bBA1y8"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKQi3bBA1y8" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><a href="/tag/keanu-reeves">Keanu Reeves</a> was among the guests, and attended with this partner Alexandra Grant, both of whom reportedly left early on in the evening. The party also boasted a DJ, dancer, and pyrotechnic show, with guests invited to get souvenir <em>Matrix </em>tattoos.</p>
<p>Bianca Markarewicz, a spokesperson for Studio Babelsberg, where the event was held, said that producers told her they were shooting a “celebration scene, which was filmed in the summer, and this was in connection with that”. She added that “hygiene regulations were complied with” and asserted that “the production team consciously put this shoot with its many participants right at the end of filming”.</p>
<p>Parties of up to 50 people are allowed in Berlin and its neighbouring state, Brandenburg, but permission must be given in advance. Guests must abide by social distancing rules, and are required to wear a mask when they’re not eating or drinking.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="adXm2sDzGkQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/adXm2sDzGkQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>A spokesperson for the city of Potsdam, which is responsible for giving permission to parties, said: “No event was announced to us. There were ongoing discussions between the health authority and the studios on the topic of infection protection during filming.” The health authoritiy will reportedly be in touch with the studio about the event.</p>
<p><em>Matrix 4</em> filming was interrupted in March due to coronavirus, but was able to continue in August. Slated for release in December 2021, <a href="/film-tv/article/48015/1/behind-the-scenes-matrix-4-footage-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-san-francisco">behind-the-scenes footage</a> emerged in February, as Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss were spotted filming in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In the summer, writer and director Lilly Wachowski confirmed that <a href="/tag/the-matrix"><em>The Matrix</em></a> movies are an <a href="/film-tv/article/50038/1/lilly-wachowski-confirms-the-matrix-was-always-a-trans-allegory">allegory for the trans experience</a>. Both Lilly and Lana came out as trans after the first three films were released, with fans subsequently speculating whether the journey of the protagonist was a metaphor for gender transition. “I’m glad people are talking about <em>The Matrix </em>movies with a trans narrative,” Lilly said, “and I’m grateful I can be a part of throwing them a rope along their journey. I’m glad that it has gotten out that that was the original intention. The world wasn’t quite ready for it. The corporate world wasn’t ready for it.”</p>]]>

<p>Another week, another new <a href="/tag/palace-skateboards">Palace</a> collab. This time around, the streetwear label is teaming up with luxury label <a href="/tag/moschino">Moschino</a> for a collection full of “Peace, love, and hugs”, according to Moschino’s creative director <a href="/tag/jeremy-scott">Jeremy Scott</a>.</p>
<p>The offering – which draws inspo from Jeremy Scott’s irreverent designs (ie. <a href="/fashion/article/48009/1/lizzo-looks-like-a-snack-chocolate-dress-hershery-moschino-brit-awards">Lizzo dressed as a chocolate bar</a>) and the Italian brand’s vast archive – is made up of a combination of RTW, accessories, and skate hardware.</p>
<p>The line-up includes statement Moschino-fied skateboards, cloud print puffers, shearling jackets emblazoned with ‘Hug me’ messages, and a leather milk carton bag, as well as understated styles including graphic tees and hoodies, monogrammed denim, and bucket hats. Basically, it’s a high-fashion skateboarder’s starter kit. </p>
<p>Enlisting legendary fashion photographer <a href="/tag/david-sims">David Sims</a> to shoot the drop’s accompanying campaign, Palace explain that “Moschino is one of our favourite brands of all time: chic, sexy, innovative, and properly funny. Working with them has been a full-blown dream scenario for us and we are still buzzing on it.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the skate brand recently dropped a <a href="/fashion/article/51017/1/palace-skateboards-whitney-houston-rock-roll-hall-fame-capsule-collection">collection</a> of <a href="/tag/whitney-houston">Whitney Houston</a> inspired pieces for charity, collabed with 90s icons the <a href="/fashion/article/50511/1/rihanna-savage-fenty-show-october-fashion-news-supreme-yohji-burberry-telfar">Happy Mondays</a>, and teamed up with cycling brand Rapha for a <a href="/fashion/article/50732/1/vaquera-butt-challenge-gucci-stone-island-valentino-craig-green-fashion-news/slide-2">psychedelia-inspired collection</a>. Guess we’re taking up skating as our newest lockdown time-killer.</p>
<p>The Palace x Moschino collection is available online at <a href="https://www.palaceskateboards.com/">Palace</a> and <a href="https://www.moschino.com/">Moschino</a> on November 20, and in Japan and China on November 21.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>A 2011 horror film, which was banned in New Zealand, has found a new lease of life after going viral on <a href="/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a>. Users on the platform are filming their reactions to the controversial movie, called <em>Megan is Missing</em>, which many say has left them traumatised.</p>
<p>The film’s writer and director Michael Goi has been forced to issue a trigger warning to his newfound audience. “I got a text from Amber Perkins, the lead actress in my movie, that it was exploding on TikTok at the moment,” Goi <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@michaelgoi/video/6895149978650463494?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.independent.co.uk%2Famp;referer_video_id=6895149978650463494">told viewers</a>. </p>
<p>“I didn’t get to give you the customary warnings that I used to give people before they watched <em>Megan is Missing</em>, which are: do not watch the movie in the middle of the night, do not watch the movie alone, and if you see the words ‘photo number one’ pop up on your screen, you have about four seconds to shut off the movie if you’re already freaking out, before you start seeing things that maybe you don’t want to see.”</p><p>The director also apologised to “those who are already posting about how the movie has freaked them out”.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/meganismissing">#MeganIsMissing</a> hashtag has over 70 million views. A number of clips show people sharing their reaction to the film at 30 minutes, one hour, and after it ends – most of the time they end up in tears. Others have warned users about watching it in the first place. User @lilnutmegg <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@adriana.10.38/video/6894557157300112645">told her followers</a>: “If you are thinking of watching <em>Megan is Missing</em>, please don’t. I love horror/thriller/murder mysteries and I can watch them very easily, but this one I will never ever forget. I couldn’t even finish it.”</p>
<p><em>Megan is Missing </em>was filmed in 2006, but didn’t find distribution until 2011, when it was given a limited release. The script was written over 10 days and the film was shot in just one week. It centres on two 14-year-old students, Megan Stewart (Rachel Quinn) and Amy Herman (Amber Perkins), and tells the story of their lives in the days leading up to Megan’s disappearance, and the awful events that subsequently unfold. </p><p>The movie has been criticised for its poor acting, exploitative nature, graphic violence, and oversexualisation of teenagers. Upon its release, it was banned in New Zealand, with the country’s Office of Film and Literature Classification stating: “The feature depicts sexual violence and sexual conduct involving young people to such an extent and degree, and in such a manner, that the availability of the publication is likely to be injurious to the public good.”</p>
<p>Although <em>Megan is Missing</em> is inspired by real-life abductions of children, the actual story isn’t real, despite marketing itself as based on true events.</p>

<h1 class="fl-title"> Anthony Burgess didn’t actually want people to read A Clockwork Orange</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">In previously unpublished poetry, the writer urges people to read Shakespeare or Mary Shelley instead</h3>

<p>Anthony Burgess’ archive is a gift that keeps on giving. Last year, researchers <a href="/film-tv/article/44191/1/a-clockwork-orange-sequel-anthony-burgess-the-clockwork-condition">found a lost sequel</a> to the writer’s 20th century classic <a href="/tag/a-clockwork-orange"><em>A Clockwork Orange</em></a>, but now, a collection of previously unseen verses written by the author show him dismissing the bestselling text as a “foul farrago”, urging people to read Shakespeare and Mary Shelley instead.</p>
<p>The unpublished poetry was found at Manchester’s <a href="https://www.anthonyburgess.org/">International Anthony Burgess Foundation</a>, and includes <em>A Sonnet for the Emery Collegiate Institute</em>, a verse letter urging students not to read the novel. “<em>Advice: don’t read/ A Clockwork Orange – it’s a foul farrago/ Of made-up words that bite and bash and bleed./ I’ve written better books… So have other men, indeed./ Read Hamlet, Shelley, Keats, Doctor Zhivago</em>,” it reads.</p>
<p>He refers to the novel in another unpublished poem, titled <em>An Essay on Censorship</em>, which dates from 1989: “<em>A book is perilous, a book can slay:/ That is the text I ponder on each day,/ And, smoking, restless, wonder why I chose/ To sell my soul for thirty years of prose./ Banned in Malaysia, burned in Arkansas,/ Offensive to the Afrikaaner’s law… ‘Whom did I kill? Whom did I hurt?’ I ask,/ Reflecting that the writer’s only task/ Is not to preach or prophecy but please</em>.”</p>
<p>Burgess, who died in 1993, became known as a satirical novelist after the 1962 publication of <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, characterised by its exploration of morality and its dystopian portrayal of drugs, music, and violence. The book inspired <a href="/tag/stanley-kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a>’s 1971 cult screen adaptation of the same name, which sparked much controversy for its violent and sexually explicit scenes. </p>
<p>“Most of his other books are non-violent and not about teenage boys. But, thanks to the popularity of the film, people were always asking him about <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>,” Andrew Biswell, Burgess’s biographer and the foundation’s director, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/08/dont-read-clockwork-orange-its-a-foul-farrago-wrote-burgess">told</a> the <em>Guardian</em>.</p>
<p>“Burgess always wanted to be known as a poet. One of the things he did was to smuggle poems into his novels. You find a character who is a poet, who will write or recite a poem. In the collected poems, we can see that poetry was at the heart of his ambition as a writer,” he added.</p>]]>

<p>Amazon is taking legal action against two influencers who used the platform to sell knock-off fashion. Kelly Fitzpatrick and Sabrina Kelly-Krejci are accused of linking up with a number of third-party sellers to advertise, promote, and facilitate the sale of fake goods by the likes of <a href="/dior">Dior</a>, <a href="/gucci">Gucci</a>, and <a href="/chanel">Chanel</a>, and using their personal <a href="/instagram">Instagram</a> accounts to advertise and promote the counterfeit styles. </p>
<p>According to Amazon, Fitzpatrick and Kelly-Krejci came up with a scheme that managed to evade the platform’s counterfeit-detection systems. Posting images of the designer item next to a more generic style on their IG stories, the pair directed followers to buy through a ‘hidden link’ which took them to an Amazon listing. After receiving an order for the generic item, the sellers would then send out the counterfeit product instead.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick’s website, Stylee and Grace, outlined the process in full, explaining that by following the hidden link ‘you order a certain product that looks nothing like the designer dupe in order to hide the item from getting taken (by Amazon) and orders being cancelled’. Amazon worked out what was happening when it ordered a number of the styles and received designer dupes instead of the style that was advertised.</p>
<p>Previously part of the Amazon Associates initiative, which offers a percentage of sales to those advertising and linking to its products on Amazon’s marketplace, Fitzpatrick was subsequently removed from the program when the company realised what was going on. It is now seeking damages from both influencers and pushing for an injunction that would stop them from selling or promoting any items sold on the site. As of last week, both Fitzpatrick and Kelly-Krejci were still sharing hidden links to knock-off products on their social media channels, claims <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2020/11/12/amazon-sues-influencers-for-allegedly-marketing-counterfeits.html?__twitter_impression=true"><em>CNBC</em></a>. </p>
<p>Counterfeit products are currently a widespread problem on Amazon, with the company recently joining forces with <a href="/valentino">Valentino</a> to crack down on designer fakes. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/luxury/amazon-and-valentino-file-joint-lawsuit-over-counterfeit-shoes">two filed a joint lawsuit</a> against NY-based Kaitlyn Pan Group, which allegedly copied Valentino’s signature Rockstud shoes and sold them on the platform as its own design. In 2016, Birkenstock stopped selling through Amazon as fake versions of their sandals flooded the site, with <a href="/nike">Nike</a> following suit three years later.</p>	<figure>

<p><em>Taken from <a href="/the-autumnwinter-2020-issue">the autumn/winter 2020 issue</a> of Dazed. You can pre-order a copy of our latest issue <a href="https://boutiquemags.com/collections/frontpage/products/dazed">here</a></em></p>
<p>For most young, driven, artistically minded people, creativity has taken a serious hit this year. And yet somehow, <a href="/tag/pa-salieu">Pa Salieu</a> – the Coventry rapper taking UK rap into a mutant future – is having the time of his life. “I don’t smile, you know, but I’ve <em>been smiling</em>,” he says with a glint in his eye over Zoom. “I’m happy! I’m pushing myself, I’m unlocking new traits.”</p>
<p>The Gambian-British rapper has many reasons to be happy, despite everything. In the last 12 months, he has become one of the most hyped new musicians in the country, with everyone from FKA twigs to Virgil Abloh tapping his talent. Things really took off with “Frontline”, a gritty and urgent tale of “block life” set against twisting and colliding beats, which became Radio 1Xtra’s most-played song of 2020 to date and amassed more than three million views on YouTube. From there, his tracks only got weirder and darker, with “Bang Out” sampling the silky and ghostly jams of UK jungle favourite, Japan’s “Ghosts”.</p>
<p>Born in Slough, Salieu moved to The Gambia to live with his grandparents for five years, before returning to the UK to join his mum and younger brother and sister in Hillfields, a deprived area of Coventry (his brother, Tee, joined him for this shoot). Salieu’s lyrics don’t sugarcoat his experiences of hardship and violence growing up (several bullets remain lodged in his skull today after he was shot at last year), and yet, there are slickly playful moments that permeate the darkness. Where “My Family” depicts the grit of Hillfields, “Betty”, his other smash track, is richly melodic; club-ready and dancehall-tinged.</p>
<p>Sharing both a Gambian heritage and a polyamorous attitude to genre, Salieu has been likened by many to <a href="/tag/j-hus">J-Hus</a>, a comparison that doesn’t faze either artist. In January Hus tweeted, “I messaged Pa Salieu amp; told him not to watch what ppl are saying, to keep pushing amp; to be a Militérian.” To which Pa replied, “bro, I was born a Militérian.” But you only need to take one listen to “Block Boy”, the new single from his debut mixtape, <em>Send Them to Coventry</em>, to know that Salieu is operating on a totally different plane – a million miles from the trivia, and the trappings, of radio rotation rap.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><strong>Hi Pa. You’ve just moved to London! How’s life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu:</strong> I’ve been in full work mode. My dad worked in factories most his life and my mum does cleaning and that; they both worked so hard, and that immigrant parent workaholic mindset, it transcends, it rubs off on your kid, it’s sick. I’ve been working on my new mixtape (<em>Send Them to Coventry</em>); it’s a real mix of sounds, it’s not like a normal mixtape. It’s a little album, you get an entrance into who I am, there’s a lot of flows because, you see, I have no genre. I’ve been pinned down for most of my life, so I’m not going to let it happen with something I enjoy, with something that I can control.</p>
<p><strong>What do you mean, ‘pinned down’?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I got a criminal record young for carrying a blade. It was for my defence; I’m from the hood but they don’t understand that. With a criminal record, a normal nine-to-five went out the window for me. I’ve worked in warehouses for Hermes and Amazon; I can hack any kind of work but I only lasted two weeks; it was crazy. I’d go to the toilet and there would be racist shit written all over the walls. I am never working in no warehouse again. So when I got the chance to come to London to do music, to leave the strip and meet someone or get a link to go to the studio, I knew I had to really go for it. I can’t get a proper job, so I have to put one hundred into what I do. Music honestly saved me; there was no plan B. Making music is such a blessing. I have this outlet; I get to build something.</p>
<p><strong>Take me back to Hillfields – how did it all start for you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I had this Romanian friend, he was an international student and he had this studio setup where you could record music. I started freestyling and I just loved it. Then, on September 1st 2018, my friend AP got killed. He was my brother, my best friend. AP had started this clothing line Money Moves. He called it ‘hood representative’. Once he died, music started to pick up for me. Everything that happened, I deep it differently. ‘Hood representative’ always stuck with me. I am a representative of my hood, of any hood. For example, ‘Frontline’ is about my area in Coventry, but there are frontlines all around the world – London, New York, anywhere. AP was one of the only people to really motivate me. We shared the same vision, you know? He always looked at shit outside the box. Now I feel obliged to motivate (other artists in the same way). People haven’t even heard of Coventry, but to someone coming from the ends, where I’m coming from, I want them to feel comfortable, I want them to know that it’s in reach, it’s your time!</p>
<p>Hillfields was the ends. You’d go round the corner and there was a street full of prostitutes. Mum was a cleaner, she was a hard worker and out a lot of the time. So I helped, taking my brother and sister to school. You wake up, walk to school, all you see is fiends, come home, all you see is fiends. That’s ‘Frontline’, you know what I’m saying? All I know is what I saw. It was the hood, my secondary school was (on the same) road (as) ‘Frontline’, I’d never been to the seaside in England until last year. I’d only seen beaches when I was in Gambia.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="IaQjlagBnG0"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IaQjlagBnG0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>Do you think it’s harder for British rappers coming up from outside of London?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>Take hip hop; it started in (the Bronx), but it spread across New York, then there’s a scene in LA, in Atlanta. You know what I’m saying? Now that’s what’s happening here too. There’s more than just a UK scene; it’s London, Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham – seeing (Manchester rapper) Aitch, that makes my heart go... It’s mad. If you’re in the hood, you’re in the hood, wherever you are. Coventry is not like London; there’s less opportunity. The only part I loved about it is the culture. I know Urdu words, Afghan words, I know Somali words. There would be 50 different nationalities just in Hillfields, you know? That’s the good thing, the culture.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think you wouldn’t have gotten involved in crime if there’d been more youth clubs, more opportunities?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>Yeah. I never went out of the (area), like I said; I never even went to the seaside. So many people I went to primary school with turned into crackheads or died because of the roads. What opportunities were we getting? I’m telling you, this year I’ve seen more positivity than I have in my whole life. I believe in the blessings of a mother. The only positive thing I used to see was my mum and my sister. At school, most of the people teaching me thought I was a dickhead. I felt like the school was taking me for a dickhead, and so I’d sit in the exclusion room listening to tunes on my cousin’s MP3 player. Vybz Kartel, Tupac... Music was a release for me. It was my outlet. I couldn’t listen in class so when I was in the exclusion room, I made sure I really listened, really took it in. I loved Tupac. He would talk about what was happening on the roads so unapologetically. I just found it relatable. I’m African, I’m proud, this is me, this is who you’re going to get. You know? I’m not a punchline rapper, you’re going to have to listen to what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>You spent several years living in The Gambia as a child, did you enjoy it there?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I got sent there so my mum could be the breadwinner for her parents – till the day my grandma died, mum would always be sending money back. I remember so much from when I was there, even though I was just a kid. Mum is always shocked when she reads the stories in my interviews. I loved it. I was a proper grandbaby, you know? The favourite, innit. My grandma lived in a town called Bundung and my dad’s parents lived in Serekunda, one of the big cities. They used to have a monkey at the house, and there was a whole field of mangoes behind our yard. I used to climb the mango trees all the time; these are experiences that you can’t have here. My grandma liked to go off sometimes and be isolated; she’d go on these religious pilgrimages – you know when you just cut? That was my grandmother. I understand why I have certain traits, they’re from her. I like to be on my own too, to do my own thing and just get to work. I’m so lucky I got sent to Gambia; it made me stronger. I remember one time my grandma took me on the ferry from Banjul, the capital city, and we ended up in this small village called Fas Chaho. I don’t know how to explain it but it was such an experience. There were huts and donkeys everywhere; Gambia is just a different feeling, you know?</p>	<figure>

<p><strong>How did you adapt to life back in the UK? What were you like at school in Coventry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I was a cheeky kid. I wasn’t a troublemaker, but I always ended up getting excluded. School failed me. I’m dark, my African accent is strong but it was even stronger back then. In those times it wasn’t ‘cool’ to be African – well, it was always cool to me. I was very proud of who I was, that’s what Gambia did to me. I’ve lived in a place where nobody gives you dirty looks because everybody looks like you. You’re not going to take the piss out of me. So when people at school dissed me about being African, I wasn’t gonna let it go. I didn’t take any of it; I stood my ground. I always fought back.</p>
<p><strong>You went to a Positive Youth Foundation youth club – did that impact your creativity at a young age?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I just called them and started going. It was one of the only clubs in my area. It had a studio so it was a chance to do music. I loved it, I am one hundred with youth clubs, we need more for kids. The hood is a draw-out for kids. Money is money. If a kid’s hungry and he knows where he can get money, he will, you know? When my grandmother died, that’s when I thought, fuck that, the ends is not drawing me out. I can’t put my mum through that.</p>
<p><strong>Lyrically, your song ‘B***k’ is both a celebration of culture and a critique of racism. How did it come about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I was just feeling energies, I deep everything in it: <em>‘Skin tone black, the lifestyle Black, but they fear the fact.’ </em>You know what I’m saying? I remember my 18th birthday. I went to Ikea and got into a lift; there were these two white women and a kid who saw me coming in. The women both got out of the lift and the kid stayed. The doors closed, the lift went up and one second later these two women come out of the other lift right next to me, looking for the kid. OK, I get it. I’m scary. A Black yute in a hoodie, I need to cross the road so I don’t startle people. It is a fear, that’s why the word ‘Black’ is censored in the title. That’s what I feel like, something about me is an insult I don’t know about. But why? One of the lyrics is <em>‘Realise you’re my brudda, fuck a skin tone / Coming from the heart, bro, listen to the Black tone.’</em> I feel like tunes like that are needed. I grew up around white people, I grew up around Black people, Indian, Kurdish, Afghan, Pakistani, you know? I know how important culture and unity is. I know people get it, and I know more people will get it. You know, this generation is different; we ain’t taking shit, man.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“(In the studio) you’ll see me like I’m possessed or something! I won’t talk. You’d probably think I’m weird” – Pa Salieu</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Last year you were shot. Did coming that close to death alter your outlook on life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I knew I wasn’t going to die. Trust me. I’ve been shot at. I’ve been stabbed. But it’s never touched, you know? It was scary, I felt weird but I knew I wasn’t going to die. I got straight back up. I walked downstairs and told one of my boys, ‘I think I’ve been shot... am I bleeding?’ I turn around, he’s seeing blood everywhere, he takes me to the toilet, my friends get some blue hand towels, they’re trying to put them on my head, and I’m like, no, fuck this, I’m not dying in a toilet. An ambulance took me to the hospital and I remember seeing my dad cry. That changed everything. I didn’t want to put my mum through it. I discharged myself, what, five, six days after? Then, two weeks later, I’m on stage with a shaved head with GoldLink, playing the O2 (in Birmingham).</p>
<p><strong>Do you feel hopeful about the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>Yeah. Our generation ain’t a joke! You saw how racist this country is, I feel like we’re very stubborn now and nothing’s going to pass us like that, you know? I see it. This is about unity. I went to the Black Lives Matter protests – it was mad seeing the unity of everyone, I feel strong on it. Music is one of the keys to that and I think it’s going to be a big key in uniting Africa, I’m telling you. Look at (Hackney group) NSG; they’re building a studio in Ghana. I’m so proud of all this stuff going on. We’re all building.</p>
<p><strong>You posted a picture of yourself with <a href="/tag/fka-twigs">FKA twigs</a>, have you guys been working together?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>Yeah! She’s so cool, like a big sister. She’s just sick. She reached out to me and I fucked with her energy straight away. I’m proud of everyone around me that’s taking their time to help me. I’m proud of everyone I’m working with.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like being in the studio with you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>I don’t know, you’ll see me like I’m possessed or something! I won’t talk. I go to the studio (and I’m) writing, writing; I’m so focused. I just tap in when I’m there. You’d probably think I’m weird.</p>
<p><strong>I bet your mum is proud of you – what a few years...</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pa Salieu: </strong>She is. She wasn’t into the music, but (she’s into) what I’m aiming for. She’s a good woman, man. She’s a good woman. She’s just been giving and giving my whole life, and no one ever gave back to her. She doesn’t know how to say no, just like my grandma. That’s why I want to give back. I want to build schools back home in Gambia. My grandfather built a madrasa (Islamic college); me and my cousin were the first ones to go and now there’s about 600 students. So I’m seeing that and thinking, ‘OK, this is what my family has done. Now I have a chance.’ This thing that is happening with me right now, it’s a gateway. I don’t feel like I’ve done enough yet, I ain’t nowhere close to building my school, but I have to, I have to do it.</p>

<p>Last month, <a href="/Ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> declared herself the president in a video for “<a href="/music/article/50862/1/ariana-grande-is-the-president-in-her-new-video-for-positions">positions</a>”, the title track from her sixth studio album, <a href="/music/article/50925/1/new-music-friday-5-albums-to-stream-this-week">released</a> October 30. Now, she’s working in a science lab instead, in a teaser for another <em>Positions </em>track, “34+35”.</p>
<p>Posted to Instagram, the teaser shows Grande decked out in a white coat, scribbling on a clipboard as she makes her way through a high tech laboratory. Apparently, we won’t have to wait long to see the full thing, as the teaser promises: “Coming soon to a screen near you.”</p>
<p>Grande has talked about the NSFW track itself (do the maths) in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0n_aqCcTVkamp;feature=youtu.beamp;ab_channel=ZachSangShow">interview</a> on the <em>Zach Sang Show</em>, saying: “It’s ridiculous, and so funny and stupid. It’s like, absolutely absurd. It was just a fun thing.” </p>
<p>“We heard the strings that sounded so Disney and orchestral and full and pure, and I was just like: ‘yo, what is the dirtiest possible, most opposing lyric that we could write to this?’”</p>
<p>Recently, the singer also joined <a href="/thundercat">Thundercat</a> for <a href="/music/article/51098/1/watch-ariana-grande-and-thundercat-joint-performance-of-them-changes-adult-swim">a performance of his track</a> “Them Changes” at Adult Swim Festival. “It feels like Ariana and I are forever connected through Mac (Miller),” Thundercat said at the time, referring to the collaboration as: “part of the healing process.”</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">What went down at the pro-Trump ‘Million MAGA March’ rally?</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">On Saturday, Trump supporters gathered in Washington DC to dispute Joe Biden’s election win, while Alex Jones – with a security detail of Proud Boys – called for a ‘second American Revolution’</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1290/9/1299050.jpeg" alt="Million MAGA March pro-Trump rally" />
	</figure>
<p>Yesterday, thousands of pro-<a href="/Donald-trump">Trump</a> protesters descended on Washington DC for the so-called “Million MAGA March”: a gathering that brought together established far-right groups and supporters of the <a href="/politics/article/40936/1/anonymous-qanon-conspiracy-theory-donald-trump-hillary-clinton">QAnon conspiracy theory</a>, including everyone’s fave conspiracy theorist, Alex Jones. Also present were the <a href="/politics/article/50608/1/brief-history-of-the-violent-alt-right-group-the-proud-boys-donald-trump-debate">Proud Boys</a>, an <a href="/alt-right">alt-right</a> group that gained notoriety after Trump mentioned them in a presidential debate in September, shortly before their Twitter hashtag was <a href="/life-culture/article/50657/1/the-proud-boys-hashtag-has-been-hijacked-by-the-gay-community">hijacked by the gay community</a>. </p>
<p>Though <a href="/Joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> recently solidified his victory in the <a href="/us-presidential-election-2020">2020 US presidential election</a>, with a rare Democratic win <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54939212">in the state of Georgia</a>, Donald Trump continues to deny the result. Since Biden <a href="/politics/article/51021/1/us-cities-erupt-in-cheers-joe-biden-beats-donald-trump-to-the-2020-presidency">was declared president-elect</a> on November 7, having won the key battleground of Pennsylvania, the outgoing president has <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1327750127679889409">repeatedly</a> broadcasted claims of voter fraud, stirring his supporters to <a href="/politics/article/50994/1/stop-the-count-trump-supporters-try-to-break-into-vote-counting-centres-election">disrupt vote counting</a> in his favour. </p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the disputed election result was a focus point at the Washington DC rally too, with protesters chanting: “four more years” and “stop the steal”. Images of the crowd retweeted by Trump show hundreds of American flags, only outnumbered by flags reading “Trump 2020” and, of course, the ubiquitous MAGA hat.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting though, that the “Million MAGA March” didn’t quite live up to the hype, unlike 1995’s Million Man March from which it borrowed its name. The Million Man March – a historic gathering of African American men in Washington DC, organised by controversial Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan – brought together several prominent civil rights activists to highlight issues affecting the African American community. Attendance figures were controversial, but estimated to be between 650,000 and one million demonstrators. The turnout of Trump supporters on Saturday was significantly lower.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Million MAGA March vs Million Man March (2015). Stop copying Black people because you can’t do it like us. The funny part is Trump supporters are excited about this small crowd. 😂😂😂😂 <a href="https://t.co/DICP4APGsH">pic.twitter.com/DICP4APGsH</a></p>mdash; African Diaspora News Channel (@AfrDiasporaNews) <a href="https://twitter.com/AfrDiasporaNews/status/1327944150440964097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2020</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p>Nevertheless, any outpouring of support for a president that refuses to concede an election is significant, especially as the mostly-peaceful daytime rally gave way to violent clashes between Trump supporters, counter demonstrators, and police as night fell over Washington DC.</p>
<p>Below, we’ve gathered everything you need to know about what went down at the “Million MAGA March”, as well as the response from Donald Trump (and <a href="/k-pop">K-pop</a> stans, of course).</p>
<h2>TRUMP SUPPORTERS TRAVELLED ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO ATTEND</h2>
<p>Despite the fact that <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> continues to spread rapidly across the US, with 11 million cases and 245,000 deaths recorded as of November 15, Trump supporters travelled to DC from as far as Los Angeles and Seattle, as well as states such as Florida and New York, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/15/million-maga-march-trump-supporters">reported</a> by the <em>Guardian. </em></p>
<p>Beginning around noon on Saturday (5pm UK time) at the White House-adjacent Freedom Plaza, the demonstrations revolved around Trump’s baseless claims about election fraud. Later in the day, the crowd also moved on to the Supreme Court, where it was met with opposition from counter protesters.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

                </div>
<h2>FIGHTS BROKE OUT BETWEEN TRUMP SUPPORTERS AND COUNTER-PROTESTERS</h2>
<p>Right wing commentators including Tomi Lahren have <a href="https://twitter.com/TomiLahren/status/1327673578238701569">suggested</a> that the Million MAGA March was peaceful, complimenting Trump supporters on their lack of violence and property destruction, and trying to contrast the rally with <a href="/black-lives-matter">Black Lives Matter</a> protests earlier this year (which were also, incidentally, <a href="/politics/article/50366/1/over-93-of-blm-protests-in-us-have-been-peaceful-says-new-acled-report">mostly peaceful</a>). However, the <em>BBC</em> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-54945154">reports</a> that twenty people were arrested on various charges at the march, including assault and the possession of firearms.</p>
<p>Two police officers were injured in the clashes and another person was stabbed, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-elections-542e7e916e11255d5ddea6e62b6d5c3b">according to</a> the <em>Associated Press</em>. Videos shared to Twitter also show Trump supporters tearing down Black Lives Matter placards at the recently-renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza.</p>
<p>As always, it’s important to <a href="/science-tech/article/49439/1/how-to-spot-misinformation-amid-the-black-lives-matter-protests">watch out for misinformation</a> surrounding the protests and the subsequent conflict shared on social media, with many videos and quotes lacking context. In one case, a widely-shared video – shared by right wing blogger Andy Ngô and retweeted by Trump – shows “BLM rioters knocking a man unconscious” while omitting the fact that he started the conflict, as seen in an uncut video.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h2>ALEX JONES MADE AN APPEARANCE, ALONG WITH QANON</h2>
<p>The QAnon conspiracy theory, which began on 4Chan and 8Chan messageboards, has grown its presence on more mainstream platforms and IRL throughout the Trump presidency, so much so that Facebook and other social media platforms have had to <a href="/science-tech/article/50687/1/facebook-bans-all-qanon-accounts-on-its-platforms-conspiracy-theory-instagram">address it directly</a>. Following appearances at previous Trump rallies, supporters of the conspiracy – and its enigmatic figurehead, Q – seemingly surfaced at the Million MAGA March as well, via pro-Q placards and dog whistle phrases referencing “The Storm”.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>Never one to miss out on an audience for his wild conspiracy theories, Alex Jones was also in attendance, flanked by self-identified members of the far-right Proud Boys (read a brief history of the group <a href="/politics/article/50608/1/brief-history-of-the-violent-alt-right-group-the-proud-boys-donald-trump-debate">here</a>). Addressing the crowd, who were heard chanting his name as they marched, Jones spoke about a “second American Revolution” and led chants of “1776”.</p>
<p>In a particularly deranged (but characteristic) moment, Jones also <a href="https://twitter.com/VenturaReport/status/1327704877250834442">stated</a>: “We declare independence from that communist Chinese agent Joe Biden and his demonic paedophile family.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h2>WHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP THINK ABOUT ALL OF THIS?</h2>
<p>Trump has been stoking conspiracies about voter fraud since the November 3 presidential election, and even warned before that, should he lose, he would declare it rigged. In a previous press conference, he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZk6VzSLe4Y" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DJZk6VzSLe4Yamp;source=gmailamp;ust=1605539379591000amp;usg=AOvVaw1W5FzLjNC9YEh5M75iAcdV">refused to explicitly condemn</a> far-right groups – instead, he what about-ed about left-wing groups like Antifa, and told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by”. It comes as no surprise, then, that Trump has been vocal in his support for the Million MAGA March. He even made a (very brief) appearance at the event, giving a wave as he drove by on his way to play golf on Saturday morning.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">
                        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump could’ve delivered a rousing speech to his followers at the Million MAGA March but instead he opted to drive through them so he could play golf. <a href="https://t.co/HHH8wQVsyf">pic.twitter.com/HHH8wQVsyf</a></p>mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href="https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1327670356522524674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2020</a></blockquote>
                    </div>
                </div>
<p>Trump has continued to tweet claims that the media has suppressed the voice of his supporters since the rally, a claim echoed at the march itself. He has also decried the actions of “Radical Left ANTIFA SCUM” and told police: “do your job and don’t hold back!”</p>
<p>Trump has attempted to overturn the election result in courts since Biden’s win, and has refused to begin transition proceedings, but has faced setbacks in multiple states – including Philadelphia and Pennsylvania – as judges reject his team’s requests to invalidate mail-in ballots. A lawsuit has also been dropped in Arizona after it became clear that the Democratic lead was to large to be affected by a review.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">A German court has ruled that techno is, in fact, music</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Some good news for Berlin’s clubs, which will be among the venues receiving a tax cut</h3>

<p>A <a href="/germany">German</a> court has officially established that <a href="/techno">techno</a> is a genre of music. Although that may seem pretty self-explanatory, the decision will have a significant impact on the country’s clubs, reducing their financial burdens if and when they begin to reopen in the wake of nationwide <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> lockdowns.</p>
<p>In particular, venues such as Berlin’s notorious KiKatClub will receive a tax cut on ticket fees due to the ruling, paying 7 per cent VAT on ticket sales (as opposed to the 19 per cent they previously had to pay), as is already the case for more traditional music venues.</p>
<p>The decision was made in Germany’s financial high court in Munich at the end of last month (October 29), and hinges on the fact that “the average visitor” is primarily there to experience the music, making club nights comparable to normal concerts. The DJs don’t just play other peoples’ tracks, the court stated, as reported by <a href="https://www.thelocal.de/20201111/german-court-declares-techo-to-be-music"><em>The Local</em></a>: “they perform their own new pieces of music using instruments in the broader sense, to create new sound sequences that have their own character.”</p>
<p>While KitKatClub is among the many venues livestreaming from its <a href="https://kitkatclub.tv/">website</a> to raise funds during lockdown, <a href="/berghain">Berghain</a> has been transformed into <a href="/art-photography/article/50101/1/berghain-berlin-exhibit-art-by-olafur-eliasson-wolfgang-tillmans-and-more">a massive art venue</a>. Since cancelling all of its live events, the club has hosted a <a href="/life-culture/article/49952/1/berlin-berghain-reopens-to-public-with-surreal-sound-art-exhibition-coronavirus">surreal sound art installation</a> and exhibited artists including <a href="/olafur-eliasson">Olafur Eliasson</a>, <a href="/wolfgang-tillmans">Wolfgang Tillmans</a>, and Tacita Dean, alongside rising artists living in Berlin.</p>
<p>Unlike other clubs, Berghain already benefited from the lower tax rates, as German courts <a href="/artsandculture/article/32809/1/berghain-recognised-as-high-art-by-german-law-ruling">recognised the club as high art</a> in and of itself back in 2016.</p>]]>

<p><a href="/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> has joined <a href="/thundercat">Thundercat</a> for a performance of “Them Changes”, a track first released on the latter musician’s <em>The Beyond / Where the Giants Roam </em>EP back in 2015. </p>
<p>The pair teamed up during the first day of <a href="https://www.adultswim.com/presents/festival/index.html">Adult Swim Festival</a>, with Grande joining Thundercat live onstage. It’s not Grande’s first time singing on the track though, since she previously took it on in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9wvtSgJ1YMamp;ab_channel=BBCRadio1VEVO">a cover</a> for <em>BBC Radio 1</em>’s Live Lounge in 2018, then calling it her “favourite song of the past year and a half”.</p>
<p>“It feels like Ariana and I are forever connected through Mac,” says Thundercat in a statement following the new live performance, referring to collaborator <a href="/tag/mac-miller">Mac Miller</a>, “and this is part of the healing process.”</p>
<p>Adult Swim Festival began yesterday (November 13), additionally featuring performances from <a href="/kamasi-washington">Kamasi Washington</a> and <a href="/film-tv/article/40328/1/hereditary-horror-film-ari-aster-interview"><em>Hereditary</em></a> composer Colin Stetson. Ending today (November 14), the virtual festival will also see <a href="/rico-nasty">Rico Nasty</a> perform, with a headline slot reserved for <a href="/robyn">Robyn</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, Ariana Grande also released her sixth studio album – and follow-up to 2019’s <em>thank u, next</em> – <a href="/music/article/50925/1/new-music-friday-5-albums-to-stream-this-week"><em>Positions</em></a>, alongside a <a href="/music/article/50862/1/ariana-grande-is-the-president-in-her-new-video-for-positions">presidential video</a> for the title track.</p>

<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Dua Lipa, Joan Jett, and Billy Idol will make an appearance</h3>

<p>The release of <a href="/miley-cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a>’s <em>Plastic Hearts</em> is just around the corner, with the new record – her seventh studio album – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGq_3QEJLA0/">set to arrive</a> on November 27. Ahead of the release though, Cyrus has revealed the album’s tracklist in an Instagram post, teasing a few featured artists.</p>
<p>The <em>Plastic Hearts </em>tracklist, scrawled in pink ink, includes guest appearances from <a href="/dua-lipa">Dua Lipa</a>, <a href="/joan-jett">Joan Jett</a>, and Billy Idol. Cyrus has also heavily sampled Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks on the <em>Plastic Hearts </em>track “Midnight Sky”. </p>
<p>Though Nicks doesn’t appear on the tracklist itself, she did <a href="/music/article/51006/1/drop-everything-and-listen-to-a-miley-cyrus-and-stevie-nicks-collab">recently link up</a> with Cyrus for a remix of “Midnight Sky”, telling her: “You can borrow from me anytime.”</p>
<p>Besides working on the forthcoming record (and a much-anticipated <a href="/metallica">Metallica</a> covers album) Cyrus has spent 2020 proving herself <a href="/music/article/50829/1/miley-cyrus-best-cover-songs-zombie-jolene-my-future">the pop queen of lockdown</a> as she shares her takes on songs by <a href="/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a>, <a href="/blondie">Blondie</a>, the <a href="/the-velvet-underground">Velvet Underground</a>, and many more.</p>

<p>Besides encouraging a huge amount of young voters to hit the polls in the 2020 US presidential election, and raising an impressive $3.6 million for the critical upcoming Georgia Senate run-offs, former Georgia governor candidate <a href="https://www.instagram.com/staceyabrams/?hl=en">Stacey Abrams</a> has also been busy solving the <a href="/tag/buffy"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a> love triangle debate once and for all. </p>
<p>Taking to Twitter on Monday (November 9), Abrams concluded that Spike was the right choice for Buffy (and tbh, agree). “To be fair, Angel was the right boyfriend for Buffy coming into her power,” Abrams responded to a tweet on the subject. “Spike was the right man to be with as she became the power.”</p>
<p>Following the post, cast members from the cult TV show joined in the debate on who Sarah Michelle Gellar’s character should have ended up with. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/strongdanny/">Danny Strong</a> – who played Jonathan on the show – responded agreeing with Abrams, while <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reagandotcom/?hl=en">Adam Busch</a>, who played Warren Mears, tweeted, “Relationships are all about timing”. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tommylenk/?hl=en">Tom Lenk</a>, who played Andrew Mells, chimed in with a simple: “Woah.” Basically sums up our thoughts on the subject.</p>
<p>The show’s creator, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/whedonworld/">Joss Whedon</a>, dove into the debate as well, responding to Abrams’ tweet with a passionate, “I AGREE! (during squee).” Alyson Hannigan – who starred as Buffy's best friend, Willow Rosenberg – had other ideas, however. She tweeted, “Actually Buffy should have dated Willow”. We guess the age old Buffy love triangle (or... square?) debate can't be laid to rest, after all. Anyways, time to stream <em>Buffy</em>.</p>

<p>In September, university students returned to campuses for the first time since the UK went into lockdown in March. Predictably, within two weeks, hundreds found themselves forced into self-isolation as <a href="/tag/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> cases soared.</p>
<p>Locked down in small rooms with strangers, students began putting signs in their windows, urging the universities to consider their mental health. Others questioned, ‘<a href="https://twitter.com/DanielHewittITV/status/1310529899506143233">9k 4 what?</a>’, as frustration over extortionate tuition and accommodation fees began to mount. Students queried why they’d been sent to uni at all when lectures and seminars are happening online, and criticised the government for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/07/coronavirus-young-people-urged-to-follow-rules-as-uk-cases-rise">scapegoating young people</a> as responsible for the second spike.</p>
<p>In Manchester, tensions have come to a head. Last week (November 5), first year students at the University of Manchester woke up to find themselves caged into their accommodation. Overnight, and without warning nor explanation, the institution had erected fences around the city’s Fallowfield halls of residence. That night, students <a href="/life-culture/article/51011/1/caged-manchester-university-students-rip-down-lockdown-fences-coronavirus">tore down the fences</a> in protest, accusing the university of <a href="https://twitter.com/kirsten_humm/status/1324472494837932033">treating them like animals</a>.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
                    <div class="content-tweet">

<p>Now, rent-striking students have begun occupying Owens Park Tower – one of the uni’s buildings – in demonstration against high rents, poor living conditions, and a lack of support during the pandemic. 18-year-old Ben McGowan, who’s part of the occupation, <a href="https://twitter.com/BenMcGowan_/status/1326891411791294466">said</a> it’s socially distanced, with people grouped within their households in the building.</p>
<p>“We’ve been withholding our rent for three weeks now,” 18-year-old Izzy Smitheman tells Dazed, “because we believe the university has broken its contract in providing us unsafe accommodation, and lying to bring us onto campus for profit, rather than our wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Ve, one of the rent strike organisers, also cited “the frequency of break-ins, pest problems, and unaddressed maintenance issues” as part of the reason for action. “By the time the first rent instalment was due, we had over 200 rent strikers,” she explains.</p>
<p>Smitheman, who’s studying English literature and French, says students decided to escalate their action after “the university ignored our protest and rent strike”, adding that “we will not leave until they meet with us and agree to our demands”. These demands <a href="https://twitter.com/rentstrikeUoM/status/1319224414999818242">include</a> a rent reduction of 40 per cent, no penalties for ending a tenancy, and an increase in support for students in halls.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>The university has responded by <a href="https://twitter.com/rentstrikeUoM/status/1326980605742092289">cutting the WiFi</a> and increasing security presence both at the occupied Tower and halls of residence. Photos and videos on social media show large numbers of police <a href="https://twitter.com/rentstrikeUoM/status/1327010665886781440">entering students’ homes</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/GBCMANCHESTER/status/1326983740569083932">filming them</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GBCMANCHESTER/status/1327185033896095744">confiscating their belongings</a> without reason.</p>
<p>Ve tells Dazed that “the university has not met with us or replied to our demands” and is instead “talking to the SU, but won’t allow us to be in those meetings nor tell us the content of the meetings”.</p>
<p>The university echoed part of this in a <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM/status/1327266606360178689">tweet</a>, revealing that it is engaged with representatives from the student union and is “fully committed to freedom of expression”. It also <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialUoM/status/1327266607773736960">promised</a> that the president and vice-chancellor will meet with student reps over the weekend.</p>
<p>Smitheman doesn’t accept this promise. “The university has been consistently neglectful, and refuses to communicate with us,” she explains. Staff, however, have expressed solidarity with students, whose demands include an end to staff redundancies. </p>

<p>“The university has been consistently neglectful, and refuses to communicate with us” – Izzy Smitheman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an <a href="https://twitter.com/rentstrikeUoM/status/1327203345904365572">email</a> shared by the <a href="https://twitter.com/rentstrikeUoM">UoM Rent Strike</a> Twitter account, 192 staff members said they had written to the president of the university to express their “disgust and shame at their treatment of you”. The email’s author, who hasn’t been named, said they “have never been so ashamed to be associated with the university” in their 25 years of working there. They concluded: “Despite these terrible actions, know that you are valued. You are the beating heart of our university and the reason why so many of us love our jobs. I was proud that you tore down the fences!”</p>
<p>A group of University of Manchester alumni have also offered their support to students, <a href="https://uomalumnisolidarity.wordpress.com/">announcing</a> that they will refuse to engage in events, and withhold donations until the dispute is resolved.</p>
<p>Students have been critical of the university’s treatment of them ever since they arrived in September. Speaking to <a href="/life-culture/article/51011/1/caged-manchester-university-students-rip-down-lockdown-fences-coronavirus">Dazed</a> last week, McGowan said: “Communication on every decision has been awful. During isolation, we had minimal support; we got a food package for the quarantine period, but it arrived after we’d finished isolating, and it all expired within a day.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>McGowan, a first year politics and sociology student, also condemned the university’s lack of mental health support, which he described as “appallingly inadequate”. This appears to be the case at several uni’s across the country, with many regarding this as the reason for a spike in student suicides.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://thetab.com/uk/2020/10/28/at-least-one-university-student-has-died-every-week-since-the-start-of-term-180334"><em>The Tab</em></a>, at least one university student has died weekly since the start of term; while three of these deaths were drug-related, the rest are being treated as unsuspicious and “unrelated to COVID”. Following the death of 19-year-old University of Manchester student Finn Kitson, his father suggested that the “<a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelKitson/status/1317576650360578048">little support</a>” his son received contributed to the “severe anxiety” that may have led to his passing.</p>
<p>At last week’s protest in Manchester, demonstrators held a minute’s silence for a student who recently passed away in their halls. Ve references this tragic incident when discussing the university’s lack of support. “The university has not grown a conscience since it spent £11,000 on fences to make the campus – where a student recently killed himself – into a cage.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>“Many have found the mental toll of isolation with people they barely know to be substantial,” Sarah Cundy, a history student at the University of Manchester, wrote in an article for <a href="https://tribunemag.co.uk/2020/11/manchesters-student-revolt"><em>Tribune</em></a>. She also revealed that 100 students in one of the university’s halls of residence had to sleep on the floor in the communal area last month after their building flooded – <a href="https://twitter.com/rentstrikeUoM/status/1327154630795685889">videos</a> of the damage have been shared on social media.</p>
<p>“Since the start of term, there has been an atmosphere of anger and disappointment from the students,” Smitheman tells Dazed. “We were brought here on the promise of face-to-face teaching, yet we were lied to. The university has made it clear through countless calculated decisions that they care more about profit than our wellbeing.”</p>
<p>Ve says the university’s failures have forced students to “come together to support each other, utilising the internet to make connections”. She adds: “There is a strong feeling of joint resistance across campus, and during the occupation we have been flooded with messages of support and donations of food and supplies.”</p>
<p>”We are doing this for every student on campus,” concludes Smitheman.</p>]]>

<p>A massive outdoor artwork by <a href="/tag/nick-cave">Nick Cave</a> is under fire by local officials for resembling a sign, rather than an art piece.</p>
<p>The 160-foot-long text work titled “Truth Be Told” features the eponymous text sprayed across the School, a branch of Manhattan’s Jack Shainman Gallery. The piece was created by Cave shortly after the murder of <a href="/tag/george-floyd">George Floyd</a> to spark dialogue within the community on racial injustice and police brutality among the ongoing <a href="/tag/black-lives-matter">Black Lives Matter</a> protests.</p>
<p>But city officials and local residents have argued that the piece is technically a sign, which makes it a violation of local law. The gallery’s attorney, William J. Better, says that “Truth Be Told” is an artwork and its public display is protected by the special use permit that the School was given when it was founded in 2014.</p>
<p>“The statement is a pointed antidote to a presidency known for propaganda that disguises truth and history to present racist and nativist ideology as patriotism,” reads the description of the work on Shainman’s website. “It is also open-ended, intended to spark questions surrounding personal interpretations of truth and integrity.”</p>
<p>Shainman submitted a proposal to community officials back in August to build the work, but the town rejected the proposal on the grounds that it wasn’t public art. Nevertheless, Shainman authorised the work to be completed anyway. “I naïvely thought I could just explain it and they’d agree. They were saying it’s a sign, and it isn’t,” he told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/arts/design/nick-caves-truth-writ-large.html"><em>New York Times</em></a>.</p>
<p>“We are actively contesting the village’s assertion that this work is signage and not art,” Shainman said in a statement. “The School is a place of cultural enrichment for the community and has permits to show artwork both inside and outside of the building. We have never before dealt with issues of censorship.”</p>
<p>As for Cave, he told the <em>New York Times</em> that the village’s reaction is “another indication of where people stand”. He added that the piece is “about admitting the truth that one might otherwise lie about” and would be “really upset” if the work hadn’t gone up as planned. “It’s an artwork,” he said. “It’s freedom of expression. It’s not complicated.”</p>
<p>Jack Shainman Gallery has until December 5 to appeal with the community’s order, which it plans to do.</p>]]>

<p><em>Iniva –  or, the Insititute of International Visual Arts – is a London-based radical arts organisation that offers something no other established institution currently does in the UK: a critical and creative hub and programme that works predominantly to support and promote</em><em> Black and Asian artists. It's a bold mission anchored in iniva's founder, the late cultural theorist Stuart Hall; the library named after him, the archives of which you can explore below, is housed in iniva's own building. The Jamaican-British theorist and political activist changed Black British art and culture forever: now, generations of artists that iniva support are articulating new futures via his writings. Below, Rianna Jade Parker writes on Hall's legacy, while 3 artists from iniva past and present (Rosa-Johan Uddoh, Sunil Gupta, and Jade Montserrat) create new work responding to ideas of "movement" – a theme that the insitution's Artistic Director, Sepake Angiama, has been thinking about a lot during the events of 2020.</em></p><h2>CONTENTS</h2>

</ol><h2>RIANNA JADE PARKER ON STUART HALL’S LEGACY</h2>
<p>Stuart Hall’s Jamaica differs greatly from my own, as does his Black Britain. And yet I have relied on him heavily to understand and navigate both. What we do share is a visceral connection to the tropical island and the memories “that guarantee I shall be Jamaican all my life, no matter where I am living”. As the public intellectual writes in his 1995 essay “Negotiating Caribbean Identities” for the<em> New Left Review</em>, a title he co-founded: “The Caribbean is the first, the original and the purest diaspora. These days Blacks who have completed the triangular journey back to Britain sometimes speak of the emerging Black British diaspora, but I have to tell them that they and I are twice diasporised.”</p>
<p>As the global response to white supremacy continues, Britain’s ahistorical image of itself is being addressed in anti-racist reading lists that unsurprisingly reference a variety of Hall’s political writings for insight and contemplation of what he might bring to this moment if he were still alive. But less often discussed is Hall’s long-term and sustained engagement with Black and ethnic minority artists in Britain, especially those working in film and photography. Throughout his career and once retired, he devoted a sizable amount of his leisure time to the developing Black arts scene, both as a founding chair of Autograph, an organisation supporting Black British photographic practices, and of the Institute of International Visual Arts (iniva).</p>
<p>At iniva, Hall’s spirit continues to drive forward the mission of an important resource and support network for visual artists and writers. Today, you’ll find the institution housed in Pimlico; nestled within is the Stuart Hall Library, some of the discoveries of which you’ll find on these pages. From its inception, iniva has dedicated itself to supporting young artists and mediating between the state policymakers and funding bodies who (unevenly) distribute public monies for creative practices. Its creation in 1994 pronounced the emergence of first-generation and young migrant Black British artists who came of age in 80s Thatcherite Britain. Now, 26 years on, it’s still a vital institution supporting artists – especially those in the early stages of their career – whose practice speaks to the politics of difference. “We are the stories we tell ourselves – so, as Sylvia Wynter says, we need to come together to tell new stories and rewrite knowledge that means something to us collectively,” says Sepake Angiama, who has been director at the institute since early this year. “Iniva believes in emergence as a vital force for creation.”</p>	<figure>

<p>In November 2004, Hall delivered the Raphael Samuel Memorial Lecture to a brimming audience at London’s Conway Hall. The talk, which would later be published by iniva in a collection of essays under the title <em>Black Diaspora Artists in Britain: Three ‘Moments’ in Post-war History</em>, was the pinnacle of a day devoted to “Black Diaspora Artists in Britain, Past and Present”. With his easy charm and clarity, Hall characterised three ‘moments’ of Black art in postwar Britain.</p>
<p>The first wave, considered by Hall as the last colonials, arrived in Britain believing that they “naturally belonged to the modern movement and, in a way, it belonged to them”. Despite their own racial frictions and violent encounters in Britain, the art produced by sculptor Ronald Moody and abstractionist Frank Bowling did not match “the speed and depth of this racialising process” as seen in second-wave artworks such as Eddie Chambers’ “Destruction of the National Front” (1979–80), Keith Piper’s “Reactionary Suicide: “Black Boys Keep Swinging (Another N***er Died Today)” (1982) and Donald Rodney’s “The Lexicon of Liberation” (1984). Hall argues that “(this) new ‘horizon’ produced a polemical and politicised art: a highly graphic, iconographic art of line and montage, cutout and collage, image and slogan, the ‘message’ often appearing too pressing, too immediate, too literal, to brook formal delay and, instead, breaking insistently into ‘writing’. The Black body – stretched, threatened, distorted, degraded, imprisoned, beaten and resisting – became an iconic recurring motif.” Subjectively British, and resolutely anti-racist.</p>
<p>In the 1980s the term ‘Black British Art’ was often used to refer to the creative practices of other ethnic groups (in particular Asian and Arab) who identified with the political category ‘Black’ as a signifier indicating ‘oppressed people’ or ‘people on the margins’. Today, without racial smudging or the collapse of nuanced identities, we can accurately understand the artistic practices of Black, Asian and Arab groups – both in terms of a diasporic emplacement in the United Kingdom, and the trajectory inside and outside the established art world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We need to come together to tell new stories and rewrite knowledge that means something to us collectively” – Sepake Angiama</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the present, Black British art and culture has never been in such a productive and generative space as it is now. At iniva, artists including Steve McQueen, Yinka Shonibare and Sonia Boyce were supported early on and now resonate internationally – Boyce will be the first Black woman to represent Britain at the Venice Biennale in 2022. But, of course, the intense focus on state accolades and ‘firsts’ has not shifted. Neoliberalism makes fertile grounds for suspicion and envy among artists and cultural practitioners for widely desired international notoriety, prestigious commissions and monetary prizes – regardless of the debt-driven trajectory and isolated existence often required for such aspirations.</p>
<p>In his 1992 essay <em>“What Is This ‘Black’ in Black Popular Culture?”</em>, Hall spoke to this state that many Black artists find themselves in, calling for us to “bear in mind postmodernism’s deep and ambivalent fascination with difference – sexual difference, cultural difference, racial difference and, above all, ethnic difference. Quite in opposition to the blindness and hostility that European high culture evidenced on the whole toward ethnic difference – its inability even to speak ethnicity when it was so manifestly registering its effects – there is nothing that global postmodernism loves better than a certain kind of difference: a touch of ethnicity, a taste of the exotic, as we say in England, ‘a bit of the other’.”</p>
<p>Hall, born in pre-independence Jamaica in 1932, and forged as an acute political thinker in the UK in the second half of the century, is, in 2020, regarded as primarily an academic and a cultural theorist. Though, in truth, he saw himself as a teacher. In his posthumous memoir<em> Familiar Stranger: A Life Between Two Islands</em>, he wrote, “I wanted to be a Black intellectual but it took something of a journey – certainly no flash of insight – to reach this conclusion.” I’m sure that, for some, ‘teacher’ is not glamorous or exalting enough of a vocation for someone of his calibre and legacy. But the only theory worth having, as Hall once remarked, is that which you have to fight off, not that which you speak with profound fluency.</p>
<p>I think about this and his many other lessons from the Stuart Hall Library, a free space with an open membership where I can access rare and radical resources, just a stone’s throw away from Tate Britain physically, but much further in terms of curatorial approach. The Tate galleries have spotlighted Steve McQueen in a major solo retrospective and a public art commission in the past year alone; though as Angiama points out, it was iniva, back in 1995, who recognised his early talent and gave the young artist his first film commission.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

SPARE RIB, no 173, December 1986: Spare Rib was an active part of the Women’s Liberation Movement. Its purpose, as described in its editorial, was “to investigate and present alternatives to the traditional gender roles for women of virgin, wife or mother”. Running from 1972-93, it shaped debate about feminism in the UK, challenging the stereotyping and exploitation of women.			<span class="fl-credit">Courtesy of iniva</span>		</figcaption>

<p>The archive of Delhi-born photographer Sunil Gupta’s OVA (Organisation for Visual Arts) – which promoted the practices of international artists – is hosted at Stuart Hall Library. Gupta here takes excerpts from a personal letter from a lover and mixes them with a work originally made in 1988, which as he recalls, was made “in response to the Tory government’s reprehensible Clause 28 that declared it illegal for local councils to fund any activities that might be deemed to promote homosexual relationships”.</p>

<p>Rosa-Johan Uddoh is a performance artist and iniva’s first digital artist-in-residence. Her work explores how places, objects and characters in British popular culture affect our self-formation. This tongue-twister of a script is an extract from her upcoming publication for Focal Point Gallery and Bookworks. “Read it aloud, let it get stuck in your head and I hope you’ll get your tongue around breaking the silence around Black history in Britain, literally,” says the artist.</p>

<p><a href="https://performingborders.live/commissions/reseeding-in-correspondence-performance-to-camera-by-jade-montserrat/">Jade Montserrat</a> is a multidisciplinary artist based in Scarborough who is supported by a Stuart Hall Foundation scholarship in her work from a Black diasporic perspective in the north of England. This performance-to-camera collage was made with filmmakers Webb-Ellis, and, in the artist’s words, extends her idea that drawing is a mode of being and operating, asking, “What does it mean to survey and reclaim ‘environments’, our relationship to space, and where are potentials for reclamation or belongings?”</p>

<p>Colourful, impactful, and fantastical are the foundation of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianvu/">Brian Vu</a>’s incredible photos. The <a href="/new-york">New York</a>-based multimedia artist – mainly working in the medium of photography – has made a name for himself capturing the creative and <a href="/lgbt">LGBTQ+</a> community around him. </p>
<p>“Working with people and the individuality of everyone in my community is what drives me to do what I do,” Vu explains on the inspiration behind his images, that have featured the likes of <a href="/aquaria">Aquaria</a>, <a href="/kim-petras">Kim Petras</a>, Cupid, <a href="/beauty/community/article/42685/1/uglyworldwide-jazelle-zanaughtti">Jazzelle Zanaughtti</a>, <a href="/beauty/community/article/46865/1/laurel-charleston-drag-make-up-artist-queer-lgbtq-new-york">Laurel Charleston</a>, and <a href="/beauty/community/article/50721/1/visual-artist-dj-vile-sanchez-new-york">Vile Sánchez</a>. “We’re constantly bouncing ideas off of each other on a daily basis.” </p>
<p>When he’s not photographing other people, Vu turns the lens on himself, creating incredible looks that are as equally eye-catching as those he captures from behind the camera. Think <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG01F30DJUh/">flowers blooming from the skin</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CF-0IZWlton/">playful smileys</a>, or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG5kKkwDSfz/">important messages urging people to vote</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Working with people and the individuality of everyone in my community is what drives me to do what I do. We’re constantly bouncing ideas off of each other on a daily basis” – Brian Vu </p>

<p>In addition to his photography and make-up looks, Vu is also the co-founder of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/brianbeautyofficial/">Brian Beauty</a>, a brand he started after his partner and co-founder <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nyletron/">Nyle Fisher</a> suggested it and is the direction he wants to see the industry heading in. “(Brian Beauty) stands for limitless experimentation and alternative visual expression,” he says, also stressing the importance of racial and gender inclusivity as a given. “We are continuing to design products and visuals that exemplify our creative language,” he says on his plans to continue growing the brand. “We intend to excite our community in terms of design and performance.” </p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about yourself and where you grew up?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> I’m a multimedia artist who mainly focuses on photography. I grew up as a first generation Vietnamese-American. After college in California, I moved to New York and began my career here. </p>
<p><strong>What is it you do and how did you get into it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> I don’t like to fully label myself as it’s continually changing. Right now, I’m focusing on photography and make-up. Photography feels so natural to me; I have to capture and document my ideas and this art form is as immediate as it gets. With make-up, I started because all of my friends and subjects were really into it so I began practicing and practicing.  </p>
<p><strong>What are you trying to communicate through your work and why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> I want to document the wonderful people in my community, their integrity, and their talent. There’s an energy there that’s difficult to describe. I aim to present beauty in unconventional ways too. I share work that feels true to me. Artwork that opens up possibilities. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>Can you talk us through some of your favourite images? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> One of my favorite portraits is the photograph of Cupid with the chain look. Though the image is composed and staged, there’s a ton of emotional value there for me. I felt like it was easier to see eye to eye with collaborators afterwards. I expect nothing but the best when people come into my studio<strong> </strong>and<strong> </strong>I try to work with people who give it their all to create work that we can both be truly proud of. </p>
<p><strong>What’s been your career highlight so far and what do you hope to accomplish ultimately?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> My cover of <em>King Kong</em> was a major moment for me. It was wild to see a magazine that I respect take a chance and give me full creative freedom. Right now, I’m just happy with continuing to create and not expecting anything. As long as I see growth within my work and personal self, I’m content. </p>
<p><strong>What are you working on at the moment? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> I’m working on a major video project right now documenting some new make-up looks. It’s going to be a huge moment for me. I can’t say much more about it just yet. </p>
<p><strong>What does beauty mean to you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> Confidence in oneself is everything.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>Describe your beauty aesthetic in three words.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> Colourful, thoughtful, and sickening. </p>
<p><strong>How do you assert your identity and experiences through your beauty?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> By documenting not only myself, but the people I’m surrounded by unapologetically. </p>
<p><strong>What’s your favourite smell and why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> Lavender. It smells so cute. </p>
<p><strong>Which fictional character do you most relate to and why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> Mew from Pokemon. I feel like Mew is so powerful. It’s psychic, it’s playful, and it’s mysterious.</p>
<p><strong>When do you feel most beautiful?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> When I’m working on my art – it’s when I feel the most free. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>It is the sixth day and you are creating humans. They can look however you want them to. What do they look like and why?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> Give them wings, humans should be able to fly and not have to walk. </p>
<p><strong>Would you rather live forever as an old person or live your life in reverse?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> I’d do reverse. It’d be interesting to be a child with all the knowledge and experience of an adult. </p>
<p><strong>What is the future of beauty?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brian Vu:</strong> Freedom of expression without the confines of society, racial inclusivity, and it’s non-binary.</p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">YSL Beauty’s new initiative aims to eliminate domestic violence</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Abuse is Not Love follows reports that domestic violence has risen significantly in 2020 and sees the brand partner with various non-profits around the world </h3>

<p><a href="/beauty/tag/ysl">YSL Beauty</a> is taking a stand against domestic violence in its latest initiative, Abuse is Not Love. Through the project, the brand is hoping to drive change through partnering with non-profit organisations around the world – including Women’s Aid in the UK, En Avant Toute(s) in France and It’s on Us in America.</p>
<p>This news comes after reports that domestic violence has risen significantly in 2020. According to <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/05/fears-grow-domestic-abuse-england-enters-second-lockdown">the Guardian</a></em>, calls to <a href="https://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/">the National Domestic Abuse Helpline</a> increased 49 percent in the first three weeks of lockdown this past March. While we can’t say we expected that beauty brands would be the ones to solve this problem, we'll take it.</p>
<p>“Supporting societal shifts have always been central to the way YSL Beauty acts as a brand. Especially when it comes to the independence of women. Intimate Partner Violence hinders the safety, wellbeing and independence of women,” explained Stephan Bezy, international general manager at YSL Beauty. “It felt very natural to work on an issue that stood in opposition to our core values and beliefs.”</p>
<p>Along with its non-profit partnerships, the brand is set to launch on-campus learning programs at over 250 American universities – educating more than 60,000 students in its first year about intimate partner violence and how to support victims. In the UK, YSL will be training school advocates on how to address sexism and gender-based violence, delivering workshops and creating an educational toolkit for teaching about domestic violence.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, ambassadors to the brand, <a href="/beauty/head/article/44719/1/ysl-beaute-announces-dua-lipa-latest-ambassador">Dua Lipa</a> and <a href="/beauty/tag/zoe-kravitz">Zoë Kravitz</a> have also spoken out in support of the new initiative. “600 million women in the world are living in a country where Intimate Partner Violence is not considered a crime,” said Dua Lipa. “This is an issue that deserves attention and it is time to take action.”</p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Emo legends 3OH!3 collaborate with 100 gecs in an unexpected comeback</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">‘LONELY MACHINES’ is the duo’s first release in four years</h3>

<p>The early-noughties teens who hung out in skate parks listening to 3OH!3 straight out their flip phones are cut from the same cloth as the zoomers of today, who plan pilgrimages to the <a href="/music/article/48794/1/100-gecs-laura-les-dylan-brady-minecraft-charli-xcx" data-stringify-link="https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/48794/1/100-gecs-laura-les-dylan-brady-minecraft-charli-xcx" data-sk="tooltip_parent">100 gecs</a> tree on Google Maps and know every Dylan Brady remix by heart.</p>
<p>For this reason, a merging of the two, while certainly surprising, isn’t a big shock, especially when you consider 100 gecs’ penchant for collaboration (Think: <a href="/tag/a-g-cook">A.G. Cook</a>, <a href="/tag/charli-xcx">Charli XCX</a>, and <a href="/music/article/44167/1/dorian-electra-new-song-video-flamboyant-interview">Dorian Electra</a>).</p>
<p>Shortly after <a href="https://youtu.be/GrPnXO_Syxw">announcing their comeback</a> via YouTube video on November 9, Sean Foreman and Nathaniel Motte of 3OH!3 have returned with their first release in four years, “LONELY MACHINES”. Enlisting the help of 100 gecs, the track harkens back to the golden days of emo pop punk, recalling bangers like “DONTTRUSTME” and “My First Kiss”. Naturally, Laura Les and Dylan Brady have added their terminally online flair to the song too, so get ready for some 8-bit crunkcore.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, 100 gecs revealed yet another collaboration – this time with <a href="/music/article/51049/1/rico-nasty-and-100-gecs-dylan-brady-link-up-on-new-song-ohfr-nightmare-vacation">Rico Nasty</a>. Following on from Rico’s <a href="/music/article/50113/1/rico-nasty-shares-the-100-gecs-dylan-brady-produced-video-for-new-track-iphone">rendition of “ringtone”</a> back in August, new track “OHFR?” is an infectuous rager – <a href="/music/article/51049/1/rico-nasty-and-100-gecs-dylan-brady-link-up-on-new-song-ohfr-nightmare-vacation">watch the video here</a>.</p>

<p>ICYMI, this week saw <a href="/tag/telfar-clemens">Telfar Clemens</a> get another huge celebrity seal of approval. After congresswoman <a href="/tag/alexandria-ocasio-cortez">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a> was seen carrying her oxblood tote on the steps of the Capitol building earlier this year, <a href="/tag/oprah-winfrey">Oprah</a> has also <a href="/fashion/article/51019/1/oprah-gives-the-telfar-bag-her-seal-of-approval-favourites-list-telfar-clemens">gotten on board</a>, including the shopping bag in her annual list of favourite things. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="/tag/whitney-houston">Whitney Houston</a> got a <a href="/tag/palace-skateboards">Palace</a> <a href="/fashion/article/51017/1/palace-skateboards-whitney-houston-rock-roll-hall-fame-capsule-collection">collection</a> made in her honour, and, in good or bad news depending on your personal opinion, Emily is set to continue her adventures in Paris. Turns out 2020’s Queen Ringarde is getting <a href="/fashion/article/51065/1/what-basic-bitch-fashion-will-emily-in-paris-season-2-provide">a second series</a>. </p>

<h1 class="fl-title">New Music Friday: 6 albums to stream this week</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Including Pa Salieu’s Coventry-repping release, French RB artist Bonnie Banane’s sultry debut, and Milan club kid vibes from M¥SS KETA</h3>

	<figure>

<p>The sky is the limit for UK rapper <a href="/projects/article/48938/1/pa-salieu-musician-biography-dazed-100-2020-profile">Pa Salieu</a>, who’s been the name on everyone’s lips since the release of his breakout hit “Frontline” in January. Since then, the 23-year-old has released a string of rapturously received new tracks and appearances, including “Betty”, which was <em>Radio 1</em>’s record of the week for three consecutive weeks, and collaborations with <a href="/tag/fka-twigs">FKA twigs</a> and <a href="/tag/burberry">Burberry</a>.</p>
<p>On <em>Send Them to Coventry</em>, the rapper lurches effortlessly between afroswing, dancehall, and UK road-rap, as he ponders his Gambian heritage and hometown in Coventry. Opening track “Block Boy” is an infectious introduction to the record; its raucous hooks and inventive production serve as the backbone to Pa’s raw lyrics (“<em>My name is Pa / I’m from Hillside / bust gun, dodge slugs, got touched, skipped death”</em>). “My Family”, featuring UK rapper BackRoad Gee, is a murky track with eerie synths lines and an insidiously catchy hook, while “Energy” is decked out 80s soft-rock sounds and vocals from UK soul singer Mahalia.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, French Ramp;B artist Bonnie Banane stuns with her sultry debut <em>Sexy Planet</em>, while Milan club kid M¥SS KETA’s album is a pumpy mix of trance and hardcore, and Jazmin Bean’s release sounds like nightmarish fever dream – in the best way possible.</p>
<h2>BONNIE BANANE, <em>SEXY PLANET</em></h2><h2>FATIMA YAMAHA, <em>SPONTANEOUS ORDER</em></h2><h2>JAZMIN BEAN, <em>WORLDWIDE TORTURE</em></h2><h2>M¥SS KETA,<em> IL CIELO NON È UN LIMITE</em></h2><h2>PA SALIEU, <em>SEND THEM TO COVENTRY</em></h2><h2>TYGAPAW, <em>GET FREE</em></h2>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Watch the Safdie brothers-directed music video for Oneohtrix Point Never</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The trio, who worked together on Uncut Gems, have collaborated again on the electronic musician’s track, ‘Lost but Never Alone’</h3>

	<figure>
		<img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1290/9/1299036.jpg" alt="Oneohtrix Point Never ‘Lost but Never Alone’" />
	</figure>
<p>Directing duo <a href="/tag/josh-safdie">Josh</a> and <a href="/tag/benny-safdie">Benny Safdie</a> have once again joined forces with <a href="/tag/oneohtrix-point-never">Oneohtrix Point Never</a>. The trio, who worked together on the Safdie brothers’ films <a href="/tag/uncut-gems"><em>Uncut Gems</em></a> and <em>Good Time</em>, have collaborated on the music video for “Lost but Never Alone”, which features on the electronic musician’s new album, <em>Magic Oneohtrix Point Never</em>.</p>
<p>Splicing together a number of different scenarios, the video makes you feel like you’re channel-surfing in the 80s. In one clip, a young man gets caught with a smartphone, which his parents destroy; in another, a monster-like woman chases after someone; in one, you simply watch Oneohtrix Point Never perform.</p>
<p>“Nostalgia is both warming and deeply depressing,” Josh said of the video. “It’s a love/hate relationship. Emotions themselves are haunting. ‘Lost but Never Alone’ is a haunted piece of surfing – a screen-capture of our desire to pull meaning from the past at all times, and the triumph of breaking through it with something else.”</p>
<p>Josh added: “I love the album and this song in particular fills me with a deep sense of sadness, angst, loneliness, creativity, and, of course, triumph. We’re all lost but never alone.”</p>
<p>The Safdie brothers and Oneohtrix Point Never – real name, Daniel Lopatin – regularly collaborate, with Lopatin <a href="/music/article/45677/1/oneohtrix-point-never-is-making-the-soundtrack-to-uncut-gems">writing the scores</a> for the directing duo’s critically-acclaimed films. Josh and Benny also directed the video for Lopatin’s 2017 track, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzZ6-OqjoIgamp;ab_channel=OneohtrixVEVO">The Pure and the Damned</a>”, which appeared on the <em>Good Time </em>soundtrack.</p>

<p>A few weeks after boosting our serotonin levels when he introduced his <a href="/fashion/article/50582/1/simon-porte-jacquemus-new-puppy-toutou-dog-instagram">tiny puppy Toutou</a> to the world, <a href="/jacquemus">Jacquemus</a> is back to do the same with his latest campaign. </p>
<p>Enlisting 00s runway legend <a href="/laetitia-casta">Laetitia Casta</a> to star in the stripped-back series, the Paris-based designer dishes out a heady dose of nostalgia – with the model seen playing with an old-school games console, making a call on a Nokia cellphone, and driving a Pepto Bismol pink car with Toutou in the passenger seat (those little ears – we cannot). </p>
<p>The pièce de résistance, however, comes in the form of a Jacquemus-ified vending machine. Devoid of the usual overpriced Wotsits, Starburst, and bottles of Pepsi Max, in their place are a selection of the designer’s bags – from the tiny Chiquito to the new Bambino, its shelves are filled with a candy-coloured rainbow of his most covetable styles. The only question is: anyone got any change? </p>
<p>Check out the full <em>L’Année 97</em> campaign in the gallery above. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>What’s a shower thought you’ve had lately? A lot can happen in the shower besides the main objective. Inside the steamy cubicles, our most novel ideas arise. We span life’s greatest existential questions and epiphanies, we question the boundaries of human invention, or we perform a solid rendition of Rihanna’s “Umbrella” like it’s no one’s business<em>, </em>with said apparatus and all. Under the endless trickle of piping H2O, anything goes, but for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tanochepillo/">Elisa Sanfeliu</a>, the shower is home to her humble blank canvas. </p>
<p>As strands from our scalps spiral into an unsavoury volume in the drain, the Spanish creative attentively rescues the slithers, finding use for the runaways by adorning them against the porcelain slabs of her bathroom walls, as she constructs portraits out of her own <a href="/hair">hair</a>. “I was combing my hair and sticking it on the wall as usual, as for them not to go down the drain, when I saw an eye,” she shares on the genesis of her textured murals. “So I thought of putting a nose on it, then the mouth, the jaw and the hair.” It was at this point, Sanfeliu began to picture a man, and his presence amongst the downpour made her burst into laughter. “I live alone if you so I took a selfie of me next to the figure and joked about how I was ‘getting some tonight’ which, translated into Spanish slang, would be ‘ta noche pillo,’ my Instagram name.”</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="4" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CG5obIIlCRi/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
                </div>
<p>Sanfeliu’s spirited approach is is illustrated through her her spindly creations, spanning nude depictions of the female form that celebrate a new mode of erotic artistry. Her temporary silhouettes feature a pair of legs stretched open, a naked woman knelt on all fours looking over her shoulder, to the arcs of bosoms and bottoms with nipples neatly punctuated in thick clusters of threads. “I like to draw women's faces and bodies because of the curvy shapes; it feels more familiar and comfortable for me,” she offers.</p>
<p>Her nimble designs also document those in her immediate surroundings, a circle of Barcelona’s entrepreneurs, such as friend Paloma Lanna, the founder of the fashion label Paloma Wool – “who actually hates finding hairs, but to my surprise she loved then and asked me to represent some of her pieces,” Sanfeliu says – which <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGxjnurlUwF/">resulted in</a> a reconstructed handbag to the etchings of La Manso’s kaleidoscopic plastic rings. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Some drawings are reinterpretations of things, others are simply faces that I see and are formed naturally when I automatically stick the hairs on the wall. The drawing is almost made by itself. I see faces and then I just add more hairs to shape it” – Elisa Sanfeliu</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is it that governs her newly-established practice? “Honestly nothing, it was spontaneous and practical really,” she says. “Some drawings are reinterpretations of things, others are simply faces that I see and are formed naturally when I automatically stick the hairs on the wall. The drawing is almost made by itself. I see faces and then I just add more hairs to shape it.”</p>
<p>The dexterous sketches lend themselves to Sanfeliu’s profession outside of the washroom as a lash artist, designing eyebrows and eyelash extensions. But the shower provides her with a feeling of liberation that she’s restricted by in her day-to-day. “I always tell my clients not to wet their eyelashes or eyebrows in 24 hours. When I'm in the shower I feel like I'm working with hair but I don't have to be so precise at all, on the contrary, the water flows and the shapes are made, and if anything is misplaced it doesn’t matter.”</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
                    <blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="4" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CGxjASQFCEX/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
                </div>
<p>While we’re all conditioned into two types of shower camps: the prune or the prompt, Sanfeliu favours the former, spending around 10-15 minutes alone on her aquatic masterpieces. “Some have even taken me half an hour.” And we all know that we become an octave closer to sounding like Adele in our damp booths – thank you <a href="https://www.exploratorium.edu/exploratopia/activity_shower.html">science for proving so</a> – Sanfeliu also translates her musical musings out of her hair too. I drew the cover of the album <em>Calambre</em> by Naty Peluso the other day because her music inspires me a lot. I'm thinking of drawing more things related to music that I listen to in the shower.” </p>
<p>No matter your timings, the pressure preference or the products – be it Sanex or Olaplex – the shower is a sacred and safe place. But every soul-searching shower has its time and the tranquility of loofahs and lotions eventually runs its cause. Is she glum when it comes to and end and she’s reminded of the impermanence of her pictures? “I don’t feel sad, no. I take a picture and it’s saved forever. I also get super cold when creating these drawings so I kind of enjoy turning the hot water back on, washing it away and getting warm again.” </p>
<p>With the opening of the shower doors, or the sweep of a soggy shower curtain, reality is restored with a piercing temperature drop and the grasp of an obnoxiously small hand towel, instead of a body one. But thank goodness for hygiene, it’s never too long a wait to return to the drizzling fantasia, proving that even in places we feel overly-familiar with, flashes of ingenuity can be found where we least expect them. </p>]]>

<p>Watching the news or scrolling down your Twitter feed has mostly been pretty grim in 2020, but <a href="/Megan-thee-stallion">Megan Thee Stallion</a> is here to turn things around. On Thursday night, the Houston rapper shared details on her upcoming debut studio album, titled <em>Good News</em>, which is set to arrive next Friday (November 20).</p>
<p><em>Good</em> <em>News</em> follows her third EP <em>Suga</em>, which <a href="/music/article/48260/1/new-music-friday-albums-to-stream-this-week">was released</a> back in March this year. In between, Meg has also collaborated with <a href="/cardi-b">Cardi B</a> on her NSFW single (and unavoidable cultural phenomenon) “<a href="/music/article/50056/1/watch-cardi-b-and-megan-thee-stallion-s-music-video-for-new-single-wap">WAP</a>”, as well as <a href="/beyonce">Beyoncé</a> on a <a href="/music/article/49047/1/beyonce-features-new-remix-of-megan-thee-stallion-savage-suga-coronavirus-relief">remix</a> of the <em>Suga </em>track “Savage”.</p>
<p>“Hotties, I first want to say thank you for riding with me, growing with me, and staying down with me since my first mixtape <em>Rich Ratchet</em>!” Megan writes on Instagram, unveiling the <em>Good News </em>album artwork (see below). “Through this rough ass year we’ve all been having I felt like we could all use a lil bit of good news.”</p>
<p>Back in May, she <a href="/music/article/49115/1/megan-thee-stallion-2020-interview">told Dazed</a> about working on her debut album, writing and recording in a home studio during <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> quarantine. “I feel like it’s going to be amazing,” she said at the time, “so I can’t wait for y’all to hear that.”</p>
<p>Besides sharing new music she has been a vocal supporter of the <a href="/black-lives-matter">Black Lives Matter</a> movement in 2020. In a <em>New York Times </em>op-ed she’s <a href="/music/article/50761/1/megan-thee-stallion-champions-black-women-in-new-york-times-op-ed">championed Black women</a>, while <a href="http://dazeddigital.com/music/article/50658/1/megan-thee-stallion-demands-justice-for-breonna-taylor-on-snl">her debut</a> on <em>Saturday Night Live </em>included a call to: “protect our Black women, and love our Black women, because at the end of the day we need our Black women.”</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
