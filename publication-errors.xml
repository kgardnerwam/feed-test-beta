        <![CDATA[

        <h3>The town of Margaret Thatcher’s birth has revealed plans for an eye-watering £300,000 bronze statue of the Tory tyrant, complete with a £100,000 unveiling ceremony.</h3>
      <p>The ostentatious monument in Grantham, Lincolnshire, was <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/07/bronze-statue-for-section-28-prime-minister-margaret-thatcher-rejected-by-the-government/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">originally intended</a> to stand in London’s Parliament Square until plans were rejected for attracting protests.</p>
      <p>Thatcher’s memorial remains so controversial that the town will erect it atop a 10ft plinth in a bid to prevent it being attacked, making it a terrifying 20ft tall overall.</p>
      <p>“It’s way beyond time that we recognise Margaret Thatcher for her abilities and what she did for this country,” councillor Jacky Smith told <a href="https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2019/02/political-vandals-fail-to-deter-thatcher-statue-approval/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Lincolnite</em></a> – a judgement not shared by the many LGBT+ people who still live with <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/11/18/section-28-margaret-thatcher-anniversary-homophobia-repeal-england-wales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the scars of Section 28</a>.</p>
      <p>In spite of her questionable legacy the town plans to honour the infamous Iron Lady at an extravagant unveiling event for more than 200 guests, reserving up to 50 seats for the biggest donors.</p>
      <p>An estimated £50,200 will go towards external events organisation, audio and media for guests, staging, seating, an unveiling mechanism and crew labour.</p>
      <p>Approximately £24,250 will cover the cost of public safety, including medical support, stewarding, security, barriers, road closures, refreshments and infrastructure.</p>
      <p>And an extra cost of £35,040 has been proposed for a sound system, stage lighting, shelter for the seated area, a web page with live streaming as well as filming and editing of the event and promotional material.</p>
      <p>The plans were pushed through by South Kesteven District Council, which insists all money will be recuperated through fundraising, <a href="https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2021/02/council-sets-out-100k-thatcher-statue-unveiling-budget/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Lincolnite</em></a> reports.</p>

        <p>When scrutiny councillors called on the authority to show exactly how they intend to do this, the council replied with plans for a private fundraising appeal, the details of which have yet to be finalised.</p>
        <p>Council leader Kelham Cooke said: “The unveiling of the statute provides a unique opportunity to celebrate our heritage and harness national and international interest to promote South Kesteven as a visitor destination and attracting investment, all of which support plans to boost the local economy and regenerate the local area.”</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the council, news of the statue has also revived opposition to the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/24/section-28-uk-scotland-what-was-anniversary-history-trans-rights-margaret-thatcher-liz-truss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">much-reviled</a> former prime minister, who <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/11/16/margaret-thatcher-lgbt-the-crown-section-28-gay-promotion-gillian-anderson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was notorious</a> for her anti-LGBT+ attitudes while in power.</p>
        <p><a href="https://thelincolnite.co.uk/2020/12/14000-people-interested-in-egging-thatcher-statue/">More than 14,000 people on Facebook</a> registered their interest in attending an egg-throwing contest at the monument when it is installed.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<h3>A newly-registered Muslim charity is facing scrutiny over sermons on its website that suggest homosexuality is a disease that needs to be cured.</h3>
<p>The Cheshire-based Ghamidi Centre of Islamic Communication, which registered as a charity in December, hosted videos and audio clips in which speakers discuss “the right to beat wives” and liken gay people to murderers.</p>
<p>Islamic scholar Khalid Zaheer delivers <a href="https://www.ghamidi.tv/audios/is-there-room-for-gays-and-lesbian-in-islam-1134">one 2014 lecture</a> hosted on the charity’s website, titled: “Is There Room for Gays and Lesbians in Islam?”</p>
<p>In the clip, Zaheer says: “There’s no denying the fact that there are some people who have their own nature, inclined unnaturally towards people belonging to their own gender. It’s a disease, and this disease needs to be cured.”</p>
<h2>Muslim scholar suggests gay people help to ‘overcome disease’</h2>
<p>He continues: “The existence of a disease does not justify that the person who is suffering from it should be allowed to go for it.</p>
<p>“There are people who lose their senses and are inclined to killing others. Of course we’re not going to allow killing, because there is somebody who has a problem in his mind or is is mentally ill.”</p>

<p>Zaheer adds: “What is wrong morally is wrong. It needs to be stopped. It needs to be curved, and there are people who are suffering from diseases, which are causing them to be inclined to do things which are illegitimate.</p>
<p>“Well, we need to cure such patients and prevent them from coming close to doing what is otherwise unacceptable and illegitimate.</p>
<p>“So, we will sympathise with such people, we will help them to overcome this problem, but we will most certainly defend the principle that what is obscene is obscene, and therefore it cannot be allowed, it cannot be promoted, and in no way it can ever be declared as legitimate.”</p>

<p>Other clips preach that husbands “hold a degree of superiority over their wives”, with a sermon titled <a href="https://www.ghamidi.tv/audios/misconceptions-about-women-the-right-to-beat-wives-91">“The Right to Beat Wives”</a> appearing to conclude that husbands should have a right to “punish” their wives – though only in ways that do not leave physical injuries.</p>
<p>In its registration with the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/12/28/lgb-alliance-john-nicolson-charity-commission-abusive-transphobic-gay-snp-mp/">Charity Commission</a>, the centre lists its purpose as “the advancement of the religion of Islam for the benefit of the public, primarily but not exclusively through the provision of online information, learning and study”.</p>
<h2>Challenge over charity status for ‘gay cure’ body</h2>
<p>The sermons were challenged by the National Secular Society, which has called for the centre’s charitable status to be reviewed.</p>
<p>NSS head of policy and research Megan Manson said: “The Charity Commission should quickly review the status of the Ghamidi Centre and consider whether the material on its website is compatible with the expectation that charities provide a public benefit.</p>
<p>“And this should prompt questions over the status of ‘the advancement of religion’ as a charitable purpose in law.”</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>LGBT+ campaigner Peter Tatchell also challenged the “shocking” material and questioned why the body has charitable status, which enables it to claim tax relief and taxpayer-funded Gift Aid on donations.</p>
<p>The Ghamidi Centre of Islamic Communication did not immediately respond to a request for comment from <em>PinkNews</em>.</p>
<p>In an email to National Secular Society, a trustee for the centre agreed that “some of the content does not seem compatible with our charitable status”.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>The trustee added: “As a first step, we have temporarily removed these videos from the website. We will be reviewing these in more detail along with other content on the website. For this purpose we will also be seeking advice from our legal advisor and guidance from Charity Commission.</p>
<p>“Some of these videos are old and their titles may give wrong impression about their intended message. Certainly, there is no intention of imposing any religious ideas or values on others.</p>
<p>“We believe in freedom of expression, and the right to freedom of religion and belief are protected by the Human Rights Act. We all enjoy this freedom in a democratic country.”</p>
<p>Though the sermons in their video form have been removed from the centre’s website, they remain available as audio files.</p>]]>
