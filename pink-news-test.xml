        <![CDATA[<h3>Ellen DeGeneres has finally broken her silence on the controversy surrounding her talkshow after staff accused senior producers of bullying, sexual misconduct and racism on set.</h3>
        <p>The talkshow host faced months of backlash after former and current staffers spoke out about the “toxic” culture on the set of her show, with separate claims <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/20/ellen-degeneres-mean-accusations-bullying-staff-kevin-porter-us-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accusing </a>her of being “one of the meanest people alive”.</p>
        <p>Now, DeGeneres has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egn3CuQRHW8&t=326s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally addressed the allegations</a> at length during an opening monologue in the first episode of her show’s eighteenth season, released to YouTube before it aired on Monday (September 21).</p>
        <p>Opening the show, she joked: “Welcome to season 18 of <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>! If you’re watching because you love me, thank you. If you’re watching because you don’t love me, welcome.</p>
        <p>“How was everybody’s summer? Good? Mine was great,” she said to laughter from her virtual audience. “Super terrific!”</p>
        <p>DeGeneres continued: “Let’s get to it. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show, and then there was an investigation.</p>
        <p>“I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realise that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.”</p>
        <p><iframe title="Ellen&#039;s First Monologue of Season 18" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Egn3CuQRHW8?start=326&feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
        <h2>Ellen DeGeneres ‘is working on the impatience thing’.</h2>
        <p>DeGeneres said she and her staff have had “a lot of conversations” in recent weeks about how they can improve the workplace’s culture going forward.</p>
        <p>“We have made the necessary changes, and today we are starting a new chapter,” she said.</p>
        <p>DeGeneres also spoke out about allegations that she is “one of the meanest people alive”, saying she became known as the “Be Kind” lady after she spoke out about the suicide of gay student Tyler Clementi, who died by suicide following homophobic bullying.</p>
        <p>“Being known as the ‘Be Kind’ lady is a tricky position to be in, so let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking about changing their title or giving themselves a nickname, don’t go with the ‘Be Kind’ lady. Don’t do it.</p>
        <p>“The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient, and I am working on all of that.</p>
        <p>“I am a work-in-progress, and I am especially working on the impatience thing, and it’s not going well because it’s not happening fast enough, I’ll tell you that,” she joked.</p>
        <blockquote><p><strong>I’ve played a straight woman in movies, so I’m a <em>pretty</em> good actress.</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p>“Listen, I am a talkshow host, and you know that, but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. I’ve played a straight woman in movies, so I’m a <em>pretty</em> good actress. But I don’t think that I’m that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you.</p>
        <p>“This is me. And my intention is to always be the best person I can be, and if I’ve ever let someone down, if I’ve ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that.</p>
        <p>“If that’s ever the case, I have let myself down and I’ve hurt myself as well, because I always try to grow as a person, I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn.”</p>
        <h2>Ellen DeGeneres wants her staff to ‘be happy and be proud’ to work on her show.</h2>
        <p>DeGeneres said she loves to “make people laugh and feel good”, but said she now has a greater responsibility as a boss to 270 employees.</p>
        <p>“All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and be proud to work here,” she said.</p>
        <p>“This has been a horrible summer for people all around the world. People are losing their jobs, people are losing loved ones to a pandemic, people are losing their homes and lives in raging fires that are going on. There’s blatant racial injustice all around us. I watch the news and feel like, where do we even begin?</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

          <p>“So my hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day that people can go to escape and laugh. I want to continue to help all the people that we help everyday. And I’m committed to making this the best season that we have ever had.”</p>
          <p>DeGeneres also revealed that Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss, who has served as a DJ on her talkshow since 2014, has been promoted to co-executive producer after <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/18/ellen-degeneres-show-producers-fired-sexual-misconduct-ed-glavin-kevin-leman-jonathan-norman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three senior producers were fired</a> following a Warner Media investigation into misconduct on set.</p>
          <p>The talkshow host has faced months of backlash and criticism, beginning in March when comedian Kevin T Porter urged people to share their stories of DeGeneres “mean” behaviour.</p>
          <p>The controversy intensified when former and current staffers told <em>Buzzfeed News </em>that the talkshow was plagued by a toxic on-set culture.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<h3>François Arnaud came out as bisexual in a string of Instagram stories Sunday evening (20 September).</h3>
      <p>Arnaud, 35, described how chatting about his relationship history with some work pals prompted him to muse on the ways in bi-erasure is embedded even in the most nondescript moments of people’s lives.</p>
      <p>The star, who made a memorable guest appearance in <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/21/schitts-creek-emmmys-emmy-awards-dan-levy-eugene-levy-elton-john/"><em>Schitt’s Creek</em></a> as David’s ex, Sebastian, said he struggles as someone attracted to more than one gender to describe his relationships.</p>
      <p>“I asked myself — for the ten-thousandth time — how to tell such a story without making it seem like that was the whole story of me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure many bisexual guys feel the same and end up doing as I did,” he wrote, “letting other people’s assumptions of straightness stand uncorrected.”</p>
      <h2><strong>François Arnaud: ‘I’ve always considered myself bisexual.’</strong></h2>
      <p>Arnaud outlined how many bi folk feel impeded by people’s assumptions on their sexuality, and may feel that can’t correct them because it’s “really f***ing scary to give up your privilege”.</p>
      <p>“But here’s the thing. Silence has the perverse effect of perpetuating those stereotypes, making bi guys invisible, and leading people to doubt that we even exist,” the Canadian actor wrote.</p>
      <p>“No wonder it’s still a chore to acknowledge bisexuality without getting into lengthy explanations.”</p>
      <p>“So yes, labels are frustrating and words, imperfect. But I’ve always considered myself bisexual.</p>
      <p>“Not confused or trying to look edgy. Not disloyal. Not ashamed. Not invisible.”</p>
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

          <p> </p>
          <p>Bi-erasure remains a rampant reality both in and outside of the LGBT+ community, with <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/10/30/bi-erasure-invisibility-biphobia-health-consequences-research-assumptions-sexuality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers linking </a>the experience of having people doubt that bisexuality exists to serious health risks.</p>
          <p>Indeed, researchers warn, although all LGBT+ people suffer from “minority stress”, which contributes to poor health, bisexual people experience unique stresses because of biphobia and bi-erasure.</p>
          <p>Bisexual people are victims of negative stereotypes, for example, that bisexuality is a “phase”, and can feel “invisible” because their orientation is often assumed based on the relationship they are currently in. This can lead to inadequate healthcare.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<h3>Louis Theroux has spoken about a trans woman who died to a drug overdose a year after she was interviewed for his prison documentary.</h3>
          <p>The filmmaker had interviewed Deborah Lee Worledge in his 2007 documentary <em>Behind Bars</em>, which explored life in the US prison system.</p>
          <p>At the time Deborah, who had a decades-long record of minor criminal offences, was serving a three-month sentence for robbery at San Quentin, a men’s prison in California.</p>
          <p>When Theroux first interviewed the inmate, she was revealed to be in a loving and compassionate relationship with her cellmate, Robert.</p>
          <h2>Louis Theroux shares tragic update on trans woman featured in prison documentary.</h2>
          <p>Revisiting the documentary as part of his new series <em>Life on the Edge</em>, Theroux reflected: “Shortly after the interview, Deborah was released.</p>
          <p>“She to me represented something about San Quentin, which was that very often things weren’t quite as you would expect. Nothing was quire as simple as you might imagine it would be.</p>
          <p>“You expect brutality in prison, and violence and antagonism, so what becomes surprising is when you see something else. It’s not simply chaos, mayhem, negativity.</p>
          <p>“If you become habituated to a certain way of living, that becomes more normal, or at least more known, than what you have on the outside.”</p>

          <p>He added: “The following year, after we filmed, Deborah was back inside, and then released.</p>
          <p>“She died of a drug overdose on September 4, 2008 two days later. She is missed by many.”</p>
          <p>Theroux continued: “She had a romantic notion of being an outlaw. She was the one who said to me: ‘It’s like in the movies. there’s cops and there’s robbers, and we’re the robbers.’</p>
          <p>“She seemed to have seen the streets as a more accepting place than, as it were, mainstream society. There’s a kind of self-respect in the aspect of street code.</p>
          <p>“It might seem self-destructive, but in other ways it’s the best they can do in the situation they’re in.”</p>
          <h2>Deborah Lee Worledge: ‘Today’s a different day’.</h2>
          <p>The new documentary features a short clip of Deborah speaking to photographer Robert Gumpert in 2008, shortly before her death.</p>
          <p>In <a href="https://takeapicturetellastory.com/2011/09/deborah-lee-worledge-4-april-2008/">the full clip</a>, she expresses her hope that as trans people become more accepted in society, they would have a route to a better life.</p>

          <p>She says: “Years ago back in the 80s, when t****ies were growing up and coming of age, there was no place for us in society and we were kind of put out on the fringes of society.</p>
          <p>“We were allowed by society to be the hookers late at night, do little petty crimes, be little petty drug dealers, but we were never allowed to be in somebody’s business, to represent their business standing at the counter.</p>
          <p>“The real safe place for us was out there on the streets, in the little underworld or whatever you want to call it, being petty criminals, coming in and out of jails and stuff.</p>
          <p>“I’ve done a nine year term, and a 13 year term back to back in prison behind. Growing up out there on the street.</p>
          <p>“Today’s a different day, though, because now transsexuals are in the non-profits, and they’re being allowed to become functioning members of the community, things are becoming much more accepted.</p>
          <p>“We’re not all <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/01/09/jerry-springer-my-show-isnt-transphobic-people-just-behave-badly/">Jerry Springer</a>. And I feel pretty confident about the upward movement of my community, and proud to be a part of it.”</p>

        <![CDATA[<h3>Allison Jones Rushing, one of Donald Trump’s top picks to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court, has worrying links to an anti-LGBT+ hate group.</h3>
            <p>Rushing is one of the 20 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/additions-president-donald-j-trumps-supreme-court-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential conservative nominees Trump</a> listed earlier this month, just weeks before before Ginsburg passed away and left a vacancy on the US Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>Trump plans to replace RBG, as she was affectionately known, imminently, and has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/19/politics/trump-ruth-bader-ginsburg-vacant-seat-fill/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vowed to announce a woman</a> as his nominee this week.</p>
            <p>Rushing is one of the<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-supreme-court-list-potential-nominees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> most prominent</a> female potential nominees on Trump’s list, and has a concerning anti-LGBT+ history. According to CNN’s Daniel Dale, Trump boasted that one of his shortlisted candidates ‘”is 38 years old and could serve on the court for 50 years”, which Dale says is “almost certainly” Rushing.</p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
              <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump notes that one of the candidates on his SCOTUS short list (almost certainly Allison Jones Rushing) is 38 years old and could serve on the court for 50 years. He sarcastically says Democrats are "thrilled" about that prospect.</p>
              <p>— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) <a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1308017299119575040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
              <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
              <p>The judge was confirmed to the fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2019, but many LGBT+ organisations expressed alarm over the judge’s decade-long association with well-known anti-LGBT+ hate group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).</p>
              <p>ADF is an <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/12/alliance-defending-freedom-transphobia-anti-lgbt-hate-group-trans-kids-court-judge-robert-chatigny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-LGBT+ legal group,</a> which has been classified by the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Poverty Law Center </a>as an anti-LGBT+ hate group. The organisation has supported criminalising gay sex in America and abroad, fought for the state-enforced sterilisation of trans people, and has linked being gay to paedophilia.</p>
              <p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-newly-confirmed-federal-judge-has-ties-anti-gay-n980281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NBC News</em></a>, Rushing was an intern for ADF as a law student in 2005. She authored amicus briefs for clients in support of the ADF’s conservative views, and <a href="https://fedsoc-cms-public.s3.amazonaws.com/update/pdf/B22wZwmR6ZBq5SEsPA5qbyWBvQa7FMQ8k1MyDSo8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-authored a legal brief</a> on “religious liberty”. Between 2012 and 2017, Rushing spoke at ADF events at least once a year.</p>
              <blockquote><p><strong>Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organisations operating in this country today.</strong></p></blockquote>
              <p>Ian Wilhite, a spokesperson for Lambda Legal, said in a statement at the time of Rushing’s senate confirmation: “Throughout her brief legal career, Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organisations operating in this country today, the Alliance Defending Freedom.”</p>
              <p>Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, also told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-supreme-court-list-potential-nominees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>CNN</em></a> in a statement at the time: “Her record clearly shows she will not be a fair and independent judge — a reality with dire consequences for Fourth Circuit cases and the American people.”</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

                <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-tribute-supreme-court-lgbt-rights-barack-obama-hillary-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died at her home on Friday evening (September 18)</a> from complications of metastatic cancer of the pancreas, prompting an outpouring of love and praise for the equal rights champion and feminist icon and an immediate political firestorm.</p>
                <p>Democrats have called for a delay in replacing Ginsburg, following a precedent set during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, when Republicans senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declared a replacement would not be approved, and that the next president would instead choose his or her pick following the election.</p>
                <p>However Friday (September 18), <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/trump-nominee-to-replace-ruth-bader-ginsburg-on-supreme-court-will-get-senate-vote-mcconnell-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McConnell was adamant that a vote would be held</a> on Trump’s nominee. Ted Cruz has argued that there is a different precedent for times when the White House and Senate are controlled by the same party, which wasn’t the case under Obama.</p>
                <p>Until Ginsburg’s death, the supreme court had a 5 to 4 Republican majority. Should Trump’s nominee be appointed, this would shift to a stronger 6 to 3 conservative majority which could remain in place for decades, shaping major legal decision in the US for years to come.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<h3><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> removed the iconic “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCh2l0J1uJk&feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So long, gay Bowser</a>” line from the Nintendo 64 platformer – but in its place is new, improved bisexual energy.</h3>
                <p>For countless gays of a certain age, booting up <em>Super Mario 64</em> while their parents or guardians were asleep, huddled in their duvet covers, was a rite of passage.</p>
                <p>The news that Nintendo would release <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>, which sweeps up three of the plumber’s most iconic platformers into one cartridge, had many ready to relive the year 1996, in particular the infamous “gay Bowser” line.</p>
                <p>At the end of every lava-filled boss level – we don’t recommend getting Bowser to do your interior design, to be honest – Bowser would stomp in and Mario would have to fling him into explosive spikes.</p>
                <p>After releasing the turtle-like beast, Mario would shout, “So long, <em>King</em> Bowser” – but only, it sounded as though he was saying “gay Bowser”.</p>
                <p>So, imagine the heartbreak, the devastation, the pure pain, when it emerged that the port of <em>Super Mario 64</em> removed the beloved meme-worthy line.</p>
                <p>Fans found this out when Nintendo <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1307016634863943687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1307016634863943687%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2020%2F9%2F18%2F21445859%2Fsuper-mario-64-nintendo-switch-3d-all-stars-gay-bowser-bye-charles-martinet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared footage</a> of <em>Super Mario 64 being played on the Nintendo Switch </em>on Friday (September 18).</p>
                <p>In the new version, when Mario hurls Bowser off the stage, he simply says: “Buh-bye.”</p>

                  <h2><strong><em>Super Mario 64</em> fans lament the loss of ‘gay Bowser’ (1994 to 2020).</strong></h2>
                  <p>The tweak is no act of homophobia –instead, it’s likely the result of Nintendo basing the game on <em><a href="https://n64today.com/2017/04/30/super-mario-64-shindou-wace-race-64">Super Mario 64 Shindou Pak Taiou Version</a></em>, a refreshed version of the original released in Japan in 1997.</p>
                  <p>There’s a package of updates with this region-exclusive version, but in Japan, Bowser isn’t known as “King Koopa” as he is internationally. So having Mario refer to the big bad in this way would have confused many Japan-based fans.</p>
                  <p>But even this logical reason didn’t stop the change leaving fans reeling like Bowser being lobbed into a spiked bomb.</p>
