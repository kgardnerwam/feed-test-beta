        <![CDATA[<h3>Ellen DeGeneres has finally broken her silence on the controversy surrounding her talkshow after staff accused senior producers of bullying, sexual misconduct and racism on set.</h3>
        <p>The talkshow host faced months of backlash after former and current staffers spoke out about the “toxic” culture on the set of her show, with separate claims <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/20/ellen-degeneres-mean-accusations-bullying-staff-kevin-porter-us-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accusing </a>her of being “one of the meanest people alive”.</p>
        <p>Now, DeGeneres has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egn3CuQRHW8&t=326s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally addressed the allegations</a> at length during an opening monologue in the first episode of her show’s eighteenth season, released to YouTube before it aired on Monday (September 21).</p>
        <p>Opening the show, she joked: “Welcome to season 18 of <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>! If you’re watching because you love me, thank you. If you’re watching because you don’t love me, welcome.</p>
        <p>“How was everybody’s summer? Good? Mine was great,” she said to laughter from her virtual audience. “Super terrific!”</p>
        <p>DeGeneres continued: “Let’s get to it. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show, and then there was an investigation.</p>
        <p>“I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realise that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.”</p>

        <h2>Ellen DeGeneres ‘is working on the impatience thing’.</h2>
        <p>DeGeneres said she and her staff have had “a lot of conversations” in recent weeks about how they can improve the workplace’s culture going forward.</p>
        <p>“We have made the necessary changes, and today we are starting a new chapter,” she said.</p>
        <p>DeGeneres also spoke out about allegations that she is “one of the meanest people alive”, saying she became known as the “Be Kind” lady after she spoke out about the suicide of gay student Tyler Clementi, who died by suicide following homophobic bullying.</p>
        <p>“Being known as the ‘Be Kind’ lady is a tricky position to be in, so let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking about changing their title or giving themselves a nickname, don’t go with the ‘Be Kind’ lady. Don’t do it.</p>
        <p>“The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient, and I am working on all of that.</p>
        <p>“I am a work-in-progress, and I am especially working on the impatience thing, and it’s not going well because it’s not happening fast enough, I’ll tell you that,” she joked.</p>
        <blockquote><p><strong>I’ve played a straight woman in movies, so I’m a <em>pretty</em> good actress.</strong></p></blockquote>
        <p>“Listen, I am a talkshow host, and you know that, but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. I’ve played a straight woman in movies, so I’m a <em>pretty</em> good actress. But I don’t think that I’m that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you.</p>
        <p>“This is me. And my intention is to always be the best person I can be, and if I’ve ever let someone down, if I’ve ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that.</p>
        <p>“If that’s ever the case, I have let myself down and I’ve hurt myself as well, because I always try to grow as a person, I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn.”</p>
        <h2>Ellen DeGeneres wants her staff to ‘be happy and be proud’ to work on her show.</h2>
        <p>DeGeneres said she loves to “make people laugh and feel good”, but said she now has a greater responsibility as a boss to 270 employees.</p>
        <p>“All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and be proud to work here,” she said.</p>
        <p>“This has been a horrible summer for people all around the world. People are losing their jobs, people are losing loved ones to a pandemic, people are losing their homes and lives in raging fires that are going on. There’s blatant racial injustice all around us. I watch the news and feel like, where do we even begin?</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

          <p>“So my hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day that people can go to escape and laugh. I want to continue to help all the people that we help everyday. And I’m committed to making this the best season that we have ever had.”</p>
          <p>DeGeneres also revealed that Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss, who has served as a DJ on her talkshow since 2014, has been promoted to co-executive producer after <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/18/ellen-degeneres-show-producers-fired-sexual-misconduct-ed-glavin-kevin-leman-jonathan-norman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three senior producers were fired</a> following a Warner Media investigation into misconduct on set.</p>
          <p>The talkshow host has faced months of backlash and criticism, beginning in March when comedian Kevin T Porter urged people to share their stories of DeGeneres “mean” behaviour.</p>
          <p>The controversy intensified when former and current staffers told <em>Buzzfeed News </em>that the talkshow was plagued by a toxic on-set culture.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<h3>François Arnaud came out as bisexual in a string of Instagram stories Sunday evening (20 September).</h3>
      <p>Arnaud, 35, described how chatting about his relationship history with some work pals prompted him to muse on the ways in bi-erasure is embedded even in the most nondescript moments of people’s lives.</p>
      <p>The star, who made a memorable guest appearance in <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/21/schitts-creek-emmmys-emmy-awards-dan-levy-eugene-levy-elton-john/"><em>Schitt’s Creek</em></a> as David’s ex, Sebastian, said he struggles as someone attracted to more than one gender to describe his relationships.</p>
      <p>“I asked myself — for the ten-thousandth time — how to tell such a story without making it seem like that was the whole story of me,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure many bisexual guys feel the same and end up doing as I did,” he wrote, “letting other people’s assumptions of straightness stand uncorrected.”</p>
      <h2><strong>François Arnaud: ‘I’ve always considered myself bisexual.’</strong></h2>
      <p>Arnaud outlined how many bi folk feel impeded by people’s assumptions on their sexuality, and may feel that can’t correct them because it’s “really f***ing scary to give up your privilege”.</p>
      <p>“But here’s the thing. Silence has the perverse effect of perpetuating those stereotypes, making bi guys invisible, and leading people to doubt that we even exist,” the Canadian actor wrote.</p>
      <p>“No wonder it’s still a chore to acknowledge bisexuality without getting into lengthy explanations.”</p>
      <p>“So yes, labels are frustrating and words, imperfect. But I’ve always considered myself bisexual.</p>
      <p>“Not confused or trying to look edgy. Not disloyal. Not ashamed. Not invisible.”</p>
      <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
        <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Happy “Francois Arnaud just came out as bisexual” Day, everybody! <a href="https://t.co/C9bKOBRWbq">pic.twitter.com/C9bKOBRWbq</a></p>

          <p>Bi-erasure remains a rampant reality both in and outside of the LGBT+ community, with <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/10/30/bi-erasure-invisibility-biphobia-health-consequences-research-assumptions-sexuality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers linking </a>the experience of having people doubt that bisexuality exists to serious health risks.</p>
          <p>Indeed, researchers warn, although all LGBT+ people suffer from “minority stress”, which contributes to poor health, bisexual people experience unique stresses because of biphobia and bi-erasure.</p>
          <p>Bisexual people are victims of negative stereotypes, for example, that bisexuality is a “phase”, and can feel “invisible” because their orientation is often assumed based on the relationship they are currently in. This can lead to inadequate healthcare.</p>]]>
