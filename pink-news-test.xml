        <![CDATA[<h3>Beloved comedy series <em>Schitt</em>‘s <em>Creek</em> has shattered records with a clean sweep at the Emmy Awards, winning all of the major comedy categories.</h3>
                                                  <p>The show’s co-creator and star Dan Levy gave a number of emotional speeches at the ceremony, held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL8EVXx8Si0&feature=youtu.be">virtually</a> on Sunday night, as the show’s final season picked up a record nine awards — the most ever for a comedy show in a single year.</p>
                                                  <p>As well as picking up the awards for best comedy series, outstanding writing and outstanding directing, the show’s cast swept all of the comedic acting categories — with Eugene Levy winning for lead actor, Catherine O’Hara winning for lead actress, Dan Levy winning for supporting actor, and Annie Murphy wining for supporting actress.</p>
                                                  <h2>Schitt’s Creek ‘is a castigation of homophobia’.</h2>
                                                  <p>Accepting the award for outstanding comedy series, Dan Levy said: “This show at its core is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance, and that is something that we need more of now than we’ve ever needed before.</p>
                                                  <p>“I just wanted to say for any of you who have not registered to vote, please do so, and then go out and vote because that is the only way that we are going to have some love and acceptance out there.”</p>

                                                  <p>His father, co-creator and co-star Eugene Levy paid an emotional tribute to his son, adding: “I want to thank once again this young man who took our fish-out-of-water story about the Rose family and transformed it into a celebration of inclusivity, a castigation of homophobia, and a declaration of the power of love.”</p>
                                                  <h2>Elton John makes a surprise appearance at Emmy Awards to praise record-breaking show.</h2>
                                                  <p>The cast also received a surprise message from Elton John during the ceremony, who said: “I love Schitt’s Creek for its big Canadian heart, but three things really made the show an all-time favourite of mine.</p>
                                                  <p>“One, they name-checked me in an episode, two I met the cast after one of my shows in Italy, and three, Daniel Levy was named after one of my songs. I challenge any other nominated comedy to top that!”</p>

                                                  <p>After the show’s finale earlier this year,<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/08/schitts-creek-finale-season-6-legacy-lgbt/"> Dan Levy spoke about the many parents who wrote to thank them</a> for helping understand and embrace their children’s identity.</p>
                                                  <p>Levy said it is “the greatest takeaway I could have ever imagined from this show”.</p>
                                                  <p>“I just think back to times in my life when I was still in the closet and really struggling, and thinking if I was going to be able to live an open and authentic life myself,” he told GLAAD.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

                                                    <p>Chiyo Gomes, a 24-year-old drag artist well known among London’s queer performance scene, became a finalist for Mr Gay England 2020 in August.</p>
                                                    <p>But what was a cause for celebration quickly saw Gomes caught in the crosshairs of transphobes, determined to stymie his bid to be crowned the winner.</p>
                                                    <p>The contest’s organisers took to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgayengland/status/1306620479055237121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> to respond to the criticism with a powerful and clear message: “The Mr Gay England cooperation are PROUD to welcome any gay man to compete for one of our national titles.</p>

                                                      <p>Finalists are also judged on how much money they raise for two charities – <a href="https://charliecookson.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Charlie and Carter Foundation</a> for seriously ill children with life-limiting conditions, and the mental health charity <a href="https://www.northern-pride.com/health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Northern Pride Health Zone</a>.</p>

                                                      <p>“Imagine how delicious it would be if we made queerstory and I was the first trans man to win Mr Gay England. To hold that title. To take up that space.”</p>

        <![CDATA[<h3>The governor of the Cayman Islands has pleaded with people to be kind to each other, just a week after leaked messages from a Christian WhatsApp group showed members threatening to “lovingly” hang “one or two gays”.</h3>
                                                                  <p>Governor Martyn Roper said recent public discussion about LGBT+ people had been “irresponsible” and “shocking” during a COVID-19 press briefing on Friday (September 18).</p>
                                                                  <p>While Roper did not name <a href="https://www.caymancompass.com/2020/09/10/disturbing-and-dangerous-messages-scare-lgbtq-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cayman Caribbean Cause</a>, the Christian group in question, he made a plea for people to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p>
                                                                  <p>“I’ve seen a number of comments made on WhatsApp in recent days about the Civil Partnership Bill that I feel are deeply irresponsible. In fact, I find them quite shocking. The worst ones have been referred to the police to look into,” said Roper, according to the <a href="https://www.caymancompass.com/2020/09/19/governor-anti-lgbtq-comments-irresponsible-and-shocking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cayman Compass.</em></a></p>
                                                                  <p>“I’m not going to single out individuals or organisations but I call on both sides of this debate to lower the temperature and please think twice before posting anything on social media that would offend others in our community.”</p>
                                                                  <p>The messages, which show an incomplete snippet of a discussion about gay and LGBT+ rights, are from members of Cayman Caribbean Cause – a Christian group that includes prominent leaders from the church community in the Cayman Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory.</p>
                                                                  <p>In one, a member suggests “maybe hang one or two [gay people] in a loving way” as a warning to others.</p>
                                                                  <p>Another message suggested implementing teachings from the Quran to criminalise homosexuality, reading: “If this was a Muslim country, they’d be [thrown] out by the thousands.”</p>
                                                                  <p>Roper later added that copies of the leaked WhatsApp messages had been received by Police Commissioner Derek Byrne and were “being looked at”.</p>
                                                                  <p>Same-sex marriage was legalised in the Cayman Islands in 2019, following a lawsuit by a lesbian couple. However later that year, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/11/08/cayman-islands-legalisation-same-sex-overturned-legal-illegal-court-appeals-lesbian-couple-british-territory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the islands’ government won an appeal to overturn the legalisation.</a></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<h3>Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay presidential candidate for a major party, has one message for LGBT+ youth in the run up to the US election: Vote.</h3>
                                                                  <p>Buttigieg, the gay mayor from Indiana who was the surprise break-out star of the Democratic race earlier this year, has <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/03/joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-beau-endorsement-democratic-presidential-race-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrown his weight</a> behind Joe Biden’s bid to get Donald Trump out of the White House.</p>
                                                                  <p>And in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/18/pete-buttigieg-interview-joe-biden-donald-trump-lgbtq-gay-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, the 38-year-old has spoken out about how this year’s US election is both political and deeply personal.</p>
                                                                  <p>“When you see your own rights come up for debate, when you know something as intimate and central to your life as the existence of your family is something that is not supported by your president, and certainly your vice-president, it’s painful,” Pete Buttigieg said.</p>
                                                                  <p>“It creates a sense of urgency that I hope will motivate many people – including a lot of LGBTQ younger people who maybe weren’t deciding so much how to vote as they were whether to vote – to see now is the time to vote like your life depends on it.”</p>
                                                                  <p>Buttigieg’s history-making run to be the first openly gay US president <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/02/pete-buttigieg-drops-out-presidential-race-first-openly-gay-major-candidate-democratic-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ended</a> in March, after his campaign suffered heavy losses in South Carolina during the primary. He’s since been <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/07/joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-presidency-transition-team-us-election-2020-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tapped</a> to serve in a key role on the presidential transition team of his former rival Joe Biden.</p>
                                                                  <p>Despite Trump’s claims to support LGBT+ rights, Buttigieg said he’s very aware of how fragile the rights he and his husband, Chasten, enjoy are, saying he’s “mindful every day” that their marriage was possible “by the grace of one vote on our Supreme Court”.</p>
                                                                  <p>Pete Buttigieg continued: “[Trump has] rarely missed an opportunity to attack the community, especially trans people, whether we’re talking about the ban on military service or issues around healthcare.</p>
                                                                  <p>“But even for same-sex international adoption, this administration has taken us in the wrong direction and four more years would be a tremendous setback.</p>
                                                                  <p>“Also around the world, we’re seeing, for example in eastern Europe, really disturbing setbacks in LGBTQ rights and equality without a strong United States leading the way in human rights, which requires leadership and credibility and also that we’re doing the right thing here at home.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

                                                                            <p>The disturbing figures were published in a report from the country’s human rights ombudsman on Tuesday (September 15), <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-colombia-lgbt/more-than-60-lgbt-intersex-people-killed-in-colombia-in-first-eight-months-of-2020-idUKKBN266360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported.</p>

This represents a considerable increase from the year before, when there were 309 cases for the whole 12-month period.</p>
                                                                            <p>The ombudsman also cites 36 cases of aggression by police officers, a figure supported by previous reports of a rise in attacks fuelled by <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/08/colombia-bogota-coronavirus-gendered-lockdown-rise-transphobic-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gender-based lockdown laws</a>.</p>

                                                                            <p>The BMA also <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/bma-media-centre/leading-doctors-affirm-trans-and-non-binary-rights-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called on the government to ensure the rights of trans and non-binary people</a> in accessing healthcare.</p>
                                                                            <p>The heated public debate over whether trans and non-binary people should be allowed to self-declare their gender (a system in place in dozens of other countries including Ireland, Malta and Argentina) had put doctors in a “weird position where we’re expected to define what is a valid transition”, Dr Grace Allport, who wrote the BMA motion, told <em>PinkNews</em>.</p>
                                                                            <p>“We end up as gatekeepers, not just of healthcare but of what is ‘male’ and ‘female’,” Allport said. “It doesn’t feel like a role doctors should be doing – it doesn’t feel like something anyone should be doing for anyone else.”</p>
                                                                            <h2>Reforming the UK’s Gender Recognition Act.</h2>
                                                                            <p>In 2017, then-prime minister Theresa May suggested reforming the GRA after a government report found that only around 5,000 people from the UK’s trans population of roughly half a million people had used the law to change their legal gender.</p>
                                                                            <p>A huge public consultation on potential reforms of the GRA was held in 2018, with trans activists calling for legal recognition for non-binary trans people, access to legal gender recognition for trans 16- and 17-year-olds, and demedicalising and streamlining the gender recognition process.</p>
                                                                            <p>A key demand was for the requirement of a medical diagnosis for legal gender recognition to be removed, with May saying that “being trans is not an illness”.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">
