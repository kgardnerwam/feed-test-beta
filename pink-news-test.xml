        <![CDATA[<h3>Louis Theroux has spoken about a trans woman who died to a drug overdose a year after she was interviewed for his prison documentary.</h3>
          <p>The filmmaker had interviewed Deborah Lee Worledge in his 2007 documentary <em>Behind Bars</em>, which explored life in the US prison system.</p>
          <p>At the time Deborah, who had a decades-long record of minor criminal offences, was serving a three-month sentence for robbery at San Quentin, a men’s prison in California.</p>
          <p>When Theroux first interviewed the inmate, she was revealed to be in a loving and compassionate relationship with her cellmate, Robert.</p>
          <h2>Louis Theroux shares tragic update on trans woman featured in prison documentary.</h2>
          <p>Revisiting the documentary as part of his new series <em>Life on the Edge</em>, Theroux reflected: “Shortly after the interview, Deborah was released.</p>
          <p>“She to me represented something about San Quentin, which was that very often things weren’t quite as you would expect. Nothing was quire as simple as you might imagine it would be.</p>
          <p>“You expect brutality in prison, and violence and antagonism, so what becomes surprising is when you see something else. It’s not simply chaos, mayhem, negativity.</p>
          <p>“If you become habituated to a certain way of living, that becomes more normal, or at least more known, than what you have on the outside.”</p>

          <p>He added: “The following year, after we filmed, Deborah was back inside, and then released.</p>
          <p>“She died of a drug overdose on September 4, 2008 two days later. She is missed by many.”</p>
          <p>Theroux continued: “She had a romantic notion of being an outlaw. She was the one who said to me: ‘It’s like in the movies. there’s cops and there’s robbers, and we’re the robbers.’</p>
          <p>“She seemed to have seen the streets as a more accepting place than, as it were, mainstream society. There’s a kind of self-respect in the aspect of street code.</p>
          <p>“It might seem self-destructive, but in other ways it’s the best they can do in the situation they’re in.”</p>
          <h2>Deborah Lee Worledge: ‘Today’s a different day’.</h2>
          <p>The new documentary features a short clip of Deborah speaking to photographer Robert Gumpert in 2008, shortly before her death.</p>
          <p>In <a href="https://takeapicturetellastory.com/2011/09/deborah-lee-worledge-4-april-2008/">the full clip</a>, she expresses her hope that as trans people become more accepted in society, they would have a route to a better life.</p>

          <p>She says: “Years ago back in the 80s, when t****ies were growing up and coming of age, there was no place for us in society and we were kind of put out on the fringes of society.</p>
          <p>“We were allowed by society to be the hookers late at night, do little petty crimes, be little petty drug dealers, but we were never allowed to be in somebody’s business, to represent their business standing at the counter.</p>
          <p>“The real safe place for us was out there on the streets, in the little underworld or whatever you want to call it, being petty criminals, coming in and out of jails and stuff.</p>
          <p>“I’ve done a nine year term, and a 13 year term back to back in prison behind. Growing up out there on the street.</p>
          <p>“Today’s a different day, though, because now transsexuals are in the non-profits, and they’re being allowed to become functioning members of the community, things are becoming much more accepted.</p>
          <p>“We’re not all <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/01/09/jerry-springer-my-show-isnt-transphobic-people-just-behave-badly/">Jerry Springer</a>. And I feel pretty confident about the upward movement of my community, and proud to be a part of it.”</p>
          <p>Louis Theroux <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/04/louis-theroux-trans-transgender-life-behind-bars-life-on-the-edge-bbc/">has previously said that he regrets parts of the original 2007 documentary,</a> which referred to Deborah by her birth name and used male pronouns for her during voice-over segments.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

            <p>He explained to <em><a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/louis-theroux-recalls-the-mistake-he-made-when-meeting-a-trans-prisoner-for-tv-doc/">UniLad</a> </em>that since the documentary series was filmed, “it feels like the world’s moved on and all cultural norms have changed”.</p>

        <![CDATA[<h3>Allison Jones Rushing, one of Donald Trump’s top picks to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court, has worrying links to an anti-LGBT+ hate group.</h3>
            <p>Rushing is one of the 20 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/additions-president-donald-j-trumps-supreme-court-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential conservative nominees Trump</a> listed earlier this month, just weeks before before Ginsburg passed away and left a vacancy on the US Supreme Court.</p>
            <p>Trump plans to replace RBG, as she was affectionately known, imminently, and has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/19/politics/trump-ruth-bader-ginsburg-vacant-seat-fill/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vowed to announce a woman</a> as his nominee this week.</p>
            <p>Rushing is one of the<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-supreme-court-list-potential-nominees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> most prominent</a> female potential nominees on Trump’s list, and has a concerning anti-LGBT+ history. According to CNN’s Daniel Dale, Trump boasted that one of his shortlisted candidates ‘”is 38 years old and could serve on the court for 50 years”, which Dale says is “almost certainly” Rushing.</p>
            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
              <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trump notes that one of the candidates on his SCOTUS short list (almost certainly Allison Jones Rushing) is 38 years old and could serve on the court for 50 years. He sarcastically says Democrats are "thrilled" about that prospect.</p>
              <p>— Daniel Dale (@ddale8) <a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1308017299119575040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
              <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
              <p>The judge was confirmed to the fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2019, but many LGBT+ organisations expressed alarm over the judge’s decade-long association with well-known anti-LGBT+ hate group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).</p>
              <p>ADF is an <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/12/alliance-defending-freedom-transphobia-anti-lgbt-hate-group-trans-kids-court-judge-robert-chatigny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-LGBT+ legal group,</a> which has been classified by the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Poverty Law Center </a>as an anti-LGBT+ hate group. The organisation has supported criminalising gay sex in America and abroad, fought for the state-enforced sterilisation of trans people, and has linked being gay to paedophilia.</p>
              <p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-newly-confirmed-federal-judge-has-ties-anti-gay-n980281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NBC News</em></a>, Rushing was an intern for ADF as a law student in 2005. She authored amicus briefs for clients in support of the ADF’s conservative views, and <a href="https://fedsoc-cms-public.s3.amazonaws.com/update/pdf/B22wZwmR6ZBq5SEsPA5qbyWBvQa7FMQ8k1MyDSo8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-authored a legal brief</a> on “religious liberty”. Between 2012 and 2017, Rushing spoke at ADF events at least once a year.</p>
              <blockquote><p><strong>Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organisations operating in this country today.</strong></p></blockquote>
              <p>Ian Wilhite, a spokesperson for Lambda Legal, said in a statement at the time of Rushing’s senate confirmation: “Throughout her brief legal career, Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organisations operating in this country today, the Alliance Defending Freedom.”</p>
              <p>Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, also told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-supreme-court-list-potential-nominees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>CNN</em></a> in a statement at the time: “Her record clearly shows she will not be a fair and independent judge — a reality with dire consequences for Fourth Circuit cases and the American people.”</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

                <p>Ruth Bader Ginsburg <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/19/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-tribute-supreme-court-lgbt-rights-barack-obama-hillary-clinton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died at her home on Friday evening (September 18)</a> from complications of metastatic cancer of the pancreas, prompting an outpouring of love and praise for the equal rights champion and feminist icon and an immediate political firestorm.</p>
                <p>Democrats have called for a delay in replacing Ginsburg, following a precedent set during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, when Republicans senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declared a replacement would not be approved, and that the next president would instead choose his or her pick following the election.</p>
                <p>However Friday (September 18), <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/18/trump-nominee-to-replace-ruth-bader-ginsburg-on-supreme-court-will-get-senate-vote-mcconnell-says.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">McConnell was adamant that a vote would be held</a> on Trump’s nominee. Ted Cruz has argued that there is a different precedent for times when the White House and Senate are controlled by the same party, which wasn’t the case under Obama.</p>
                <p>Until Ginsburg’s death, the supreme court had a 5 to 4 Republican majority. Should Trump’s nominee be appointed, this would shift to a stronger 6 to 3 conservative majority which could remain in place for decades, shaping major legal decision in the US for years to come.</p>]]>
