      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Ellen DeGeneres has finally broken her silence on the controversy surrounding her talkshow after staff accused senior producers of bullying, sexual misconduct and racism on set.</h3>
<p>The talkshow host faced months of backlash after former and current staffers spoke out about the “toxic” culture on the set of her show, with separate claims <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/20/ellen-degeneres-mean-accusations-bullying-staff-kevin-porter-us-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accusing </a>her of being “one of the meanest people alive”.</p>
<p>Now, DeGeneres has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Egn3CuQRHW8&t=326s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally addressed the allegations</a> at length during an opening monologue in the first episode of her show’s eighteenth season, released to YouTube before it aired on Monday (September 21).</p>
<p>Opening the show, she joked: “Welcome to season 18 of <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em>! If you’re watching because you love me, thank you. If you’re watching because you don’t love me, welcome.</p>
<p>“How was everybody’s summer? Good? Mine was great,” she said to laughter from her virtual audience. “Super terrific!”</p>
<p>DeGeneres continued: “Let’s get to it. As you may have heard, this summer there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show, and then there was an investigation.</p>
<p>“I learned that things happened here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously and I want to say I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I am in a position of privilege and power and I realise that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.”</p>

<h2>Ellen DeGeneres ‘is working on the impatience thing’.</h2>
<p>DeGeneres said she and her staff have had “a lot of conversations” in recent weeks about how they can improve the workplace’s culture going forward.</p>
<p>“We have made the necessary changes, and today we are starting a new chapter,” she said.</p>
<p>DeGeneres also spoke out about allegations that she is “one of the meanest people alive”, saying she became known as the “Be Kind” lady after she spoke out about the suicide of gay student Tyler Clementi, who died by suicide following homophobic bullying.</p>
<p>“Being known as the ‘Be Kind’ lady is a tricky position to be in, so let me give you some advice out there, if anybody is thinking about changing their title or giving themselves a nickname, don’t go with the ‘Be Kind’ lady. Don’t do it.</p>
<p>“The truth is I am that person that you see on TV. I am also a lot of other things. Sometimes I get sad, I get mad, I get anxious, I get frustrated, I get impatient, and I am working on all of that.</p>
<p>“I am a work-in-progress, and I am especially working on the impatience thing, and it’s not going well because it’s not happening fast enough, I’ll tell you that,” she joked.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I’ve played a straight woman in movies, so I’m a <em>pretty</em> good actress.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>“Listen, I am a talkshow host, and you know that, but maybe some of you know that I was an actress. I’ve played a straight woman in movies, so I’m a <em>pretty</em> good actress. But I don’t think that I’m that good that I could come out here every day for 17 years and fool you.</p>
<p>“This is me. And my intention is to always be the best person I can be, and if I’ve ever let someone down, if I’ve ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that.</p>
<p>“If that’s ever the case, I have let myself down and I’ve hurt myself as well, because I always try to grow as a person, I look at everything that comes into my life as an opportunity to learn.”</p>
<h2>Ellen DeGeneres wants her staff to ‘be happy and be proud’ to work on her show.</h2>
<p>DeGeneres said she loves to “make people laugh and feel good”, but said she now has a greater responsibility as a boss to 270 employees.</p>
<p>“All I want is for every single one of them to be happy and be proud to work here,” she said.</p>
<p>“This has been a horrible summer for people all around the world. People are losing their jobs, people are losing loved ones to a pandemic, people are losing their homes and lives in raging fires that are going on. There’s blatant racial injustice all around us. I watch the news and feel like, where do we even begin?</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“So my hope is that we can still be a place of happiness and joy. I still want to be the one hour a day that people can go to escape and laugh. I want to continue to help all the people that we help everyday. And I’m committed to making this the best season that we have ever had.”</p>
<p>DeGeneres also revealed that Stephen ‘tWitch’ Boss, who has served as a DJ on her talkshow since 2014, has been promoted to co-executive producer after <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/18/ellen-degeneres-show-producers-fired-sexual-misconduct-ed-glavin-kevin-leman-jonathan-norman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three senior producers were fired</a> following a Warner Media investigation into misconduct on set.</p>
<p>The talkshow host has faced months of backlash and criticism, beginning in March when comedian Kevin T Porter urged people to share their stories of DeGeneres “mean” behaviour.</p>
<p>The controversy intensified when former and current staffers told <em>Buzzfeed News </em>that the talkshow was plagued by a toxic on-set culture.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>François Arnaud came out as bisexual in a string of Instagram stories Sunday evening (20 September).</h3>
<p>Arnaud, 35, described how chatting about his relationship history with some work pals prompted him to muse on the ways in bi-erasure is embedded even in the most nondescript moments of people’s lives.</p>
<p>The star, who made a memorable guest appearance in <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/21/schitts-creek-emmmys-emmy-awards-dan-levy-eugene-levy-elton-john/"><em>Schitt’s Creek</em></a> as David’s ex, Sebastian, said he struggles as someone attracted to more than one gender to describe his relationships.</p>
<p>“I asked myself — for the ten-thousandth time — how to tell such a story without making it seem like that was the whole story of me,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m sure many bisexual guys feel the same and end up doing as I did,” he wrote, “letting other people’s assumptions of straightness stand uncorrected.”</p>
<h2><strong>François Arnaud: ‘I’ve always considered myself bisexual.’</strong></h2>
<p>Arnaud outlined how many bi folk feel impeded by people’s assumptions on their sexuality, and may feel that can’t correct them because it’s “really f***ing scary to give up your privilege”.</p>
<p>“But here’s the thing. Silence has the perverse effect of perpetuating those stereotypes, making bi guys invisible, and leading people to doubt that we even exist,” the Canadian actor wrote.</p>
<p>“No wonder it’s still a chore to acknowledge bisexuality without getting into lengthy explanations.”</p>
<p>“So yes, labels are frustrating and words, imperfect. But I’ve always considered myself bisexual.</p>
<p>“Not confused or trying to look edgy. Not disloyal. Not ashamed. Not invisible.”</p>

<p>Bi-erasure remains a rampant reality both in and outside of the LGBT+ community, with <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/10/30/bi-erasure-invisibility-biphobia-health-consequences-research-assumptions-sexuality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">researchers linking </a>the experience of having people doubt that bisexuality exists to serious health risks.</p>
<p>Indeed, researchers warn, although all LGBT+ people suffer from “minority stress”, which contributes to poor health, bisexual people experience unique stresses because of biphobia and bi-erasure.</p>
<p>Bisexual people are victims of negative stereotypes, for example, that bisexuality is a “phase”, and can feel “invisible” because their orientation is often assumed based on the relationship they are currently in. This can lead to inadequate healthcare.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Louis Theroux has spoken about a trans woman who died to a drug overdose a year after she was interviewed for his prison documentary.</h3>
<p>The filmmaker had interviewed Deborah Lee Worledge in his 2007 documentary <em>Behind Bars</em>, which explored life in the US prison system.</p>
<p>At the time Deborah, who had a decades-long record of minor criminal offences, was serving a three-month sentence for robbery at San Quentin, a men’s prison in California.</p>
<p>When Theroux first interviewed the inmate, she was revealed to be in a loving and compassionate relationship with her cellmate, Robert.</p>
<h2>Louis Theroux shares tragic update on trans woman featured in prison documentary.</h2>
<p>Revisiting the documentary as part of his new series <em>Life on the Edge</em>, Theroux reflected: “Shortly after the interview, Deborah was released.</p>
<p>“She to me represented something about San Quentin, which was that very often things weren’t quite as you would expect. Nothing was quire as simple as you might imagine it would be.</p>
<p>“You expect brutality in prison, and violence and antagonism, so what becomes surprising is when you see something else. It’s not simply chaos, mayhem, negativity.</p>
<p>“If you become habituated to a certain way of living, that becomes more normal, or at least more known, than what you have on the outside.”</p>

<p>He added: “The following year, after we filmed, Deborah was back inside, and then released.</p>
<p>“She died of a drug overdose on September 4, 2008 two days later. She is missed by many.”</p>
<p>Theroux continued: “She had a romantic notion of being an outlaw. She was the one who said to me: ‘It’s like in the movies. there’s cops and there’s robbers, and we’re the robbers.’</p>
<p>“She seemed to have seen the streets as a more accepting place than, as it were, mainstream society. There’s a kind of self-respect in the aspect of street code.</p>
<p>“It might seem self-destructive, but in other ways it’s the best they can do in the situation they’re in.”</p>
<h2>Deborah Lee Worledge: ‘Today’s a different day’.</h2>
<p>The new documentary features a short clip of Deborah speaking to photographer Robert Gumpert in 2008, shortly before her death.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://takeapicturetellastory.com/2011/09/deborah-lee-worledge-4-april-2008/">the full clip</a>, she expresses her hope that as trans people become more accepted in society, they would have a route to a better life.</p>

<p>She says: “Years ago back in the 80s, when t****ies were growing up and coming of age, there was no place for us in society and we were kind of put out on the fringes of society.</p>
<p>“We were allowed by society to be the hookers late at night, do little petty crimes, be little petty drug dealers, but we were never allowed to be in somebody’s business, to represent their business standing at the counter.</p>
<p>“The real safe place for us was out there on the streets, in the little underworld or whatever you want to call it, being petty criminals, coming in and out of jails and stuff.</p>
<p>“I’ve done a nine year term, and a 13 year term back to back in prison behind. Growing up out there on the street.</p>
<p>“Today’s a different day, though, because now transsexuals are in the non-profits, and they’re being allowed to become functioning members of the community, things are becoming much more accepted.</p>
<p>“We’re not all <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/01/09/jerry-springer-my-show-isnt-transphobic-people-just-behave-badly/">Jerry Springer</a>. And I feel pretty confident about the upward movement of my community, and proud to be a part of it.”</p>
<p>Louis Theroux <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/04/louis-theroux-trans-transgender-life-behind-bars-life-on-the-edge-bbc/">has previously said that he regrets parts of the original 2007 documentary,</a> which referred to Deborah by her birth name and used male pronouns for her during voice-over segments.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Allison Jones Rushing, one of Donald Trump’s top picks to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court, has worrying links to an anti-LGBT+ hate group.</h3>
<p>Rushing is one of the 20 <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/additions-president-donald-j-trumps-supreme-court-list/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">potential conservative nominees Trump</a> listed earlier this month, just weeks before before Ginsburg passed away and left a vacancy on the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Trump plans to replace RBG, as she was affectionately known, imminently, and has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/19/politics/trump-ruth-bader-ginsburg-vacant-seat-fill/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vowed to announce a woman</a> as his nominee this week.</p>
<p>Rushing is one of the<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-supreme-court-list-potential-nominees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> most prominent</a> female potential nominees on Trump’s list, and has a concerning anti-LGBT+ history. According to CNN’s Daniel Dale, Trump boasted that one of his shortlisted candidates ‘”is 38 years old and could serve on the court for 50 years”, which Dale says is “almost certainly” Rushing.</p>

<p>The judge was confirmed to the fourth US Circuit Court of Appeals in March 2019, but many LGBT+ organisations expressed alarm over the judge’s decade-long association with well-known anti-LGBT+ hate group Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF).</p>
<p>ADF is an <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/12/alliance-defending-freedom-transphobia-anti-lgbt-hate-group-trans-kids-court-judge-robert-chatigny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-LGBT+ legal group,</a> which has been classified by the <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/alliance-defending-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern Poverty Law Center </a>as an anti-LGBT+ hate group. The organisation has supported criminalising gay sex in America and abroad, fought for the state-enforced sterilisation of trans people, and has linked being gay to paedophilia.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-newly-confirmed-federal-judge-has-ties-anti-gay-n980281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NBC News</em></a>, Rushing was an intern for ADF as a law student in 2005. She authored amicus briefs for clients in support of the ADF’s conservative views, and <a href="https://fedsoc-cms-public.s3.amazonaws.com/update/pdf/B22wZwmR6ZBq5SEsPA5qbyWBvQa7FMQ8k1MyDSo8.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">co-authored a legal brief</a> on “religious liberty”. Between 2012 and 2017, Rushing spoke at ADF events at least once a year.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organisations operating in this country today.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ian Wilhite, a spokesperson for Lambda Legal, said in a statement at the time of Rushing’s senate confirmation: “Throughout her brief legal career, Allison Rushing has supported and closely associated herself with one of the most extreme anti-LGBT organisations operating in this country today, the Alliance Defending Freedom.”</p>
<p>Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, also told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/trump-supreme-court-list-potential-nominees/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>CNN</em></a> in a statement at the time: “Her record clearly shows she will not be a fair and independent judge — a reality with dire consequences for Fourth Circuit cases and the American people.”</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Democrats have called for a delay in replacing Ginsburg, following a precedent set during the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency, when Republicans senate majority leader Mitch McConnell declared a replacement would not be approved, and that the next president would instead choose his or her pick following the election.</p>

<p>Until Ginsburg’s death, the supreme court had a 5 to 4 Republican majority. Should Trump’s nominee be appointed, this would shift to a stronger 6 to 3 conservative majority which could remain in place for decades, shaping major legal decision in the US for years to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em> removed the iconic “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCh2l0J1uJk&feature=emb_title" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">So long, gay Bowser</a>” line from the Nintendo 64 platformer – but in its place is new, improved bisexual energy.</h3>
<p>For countless gays of a certain age, booting up <em>Super Mario 64</em> while their parents or guardians were asleep, huddled in their duvet covers, was a rite of passage.</p>
<p>The news that Nintendo would release <em>Super Mario 3D All-Stars</em>, which sweeps up three of the plumber’s most iconic platformers into one cartridge, had many ready to relive the year 1996, in particular the infamous “gay Bowser” line.</p>
<p>At the end of every lava-filled boss level – we don’t recommend getting Bowser to do your interior design, to be honest – Bowser would stomp in and Mario would have to fling him into explosive spikes.</p>
<p>After releasing the turtle-like beast, Mario would shout, “So long, <em>King</em> Bowser” – but only, it sounded as though he was saying “gay Bowser”.</p>
<p>So, imagine the heartbreak, the devastation, the pure pain, when it emerged that the port of <em>Super Mario 64</em> removed the beloved meme-worthy line.</p>
<p>Fans found this out when Nintendo <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1307016634863943687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1307016634863943687%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2020%2F9%2F18%2F21445859%2Fsuper-mario-64-nintendo-switch-3d-all-stars-gay-bowser-bye-charles-martinet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared footage</a> of <em>Super Mario 64 being played on the Nintendo Switch </em>on Friday (September 18).</p>
<p>In the new version, when Mario hurls Bowser off the stage, he simply says: “Buh-bye.”</p>

<h2><strong><em>Super Mario 64</em> fans lament the loss of ‘gay Bowser’ (1994 to 2020).</strong></h2>
<p>The tweak is no act of homophobia –instead, it’s likely the result of Nintendo basing the game on <em><a href="https://n64today.com/2017/04/30/super-mario-64-shindou-wace-race-64">Super Mario 64 Shindou Pak Taiou Version</a></em>, a refreshed version of the original released in Japan in 1997.</p>
<p>There’s a package of updates with this region-exclusive version, but in Japan, Bowser isn’t known as “King Koopa” as he is internationally. So having Mario refer to the big bad in this way would have confused many Japan-based fans.</p>
<p>But even this logical reason didn’t stop the change leaving fans reeling like Bowser being lobbed into a spiked bomb.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Tens of thousands of people have signed a petition calling on the government to press ahead with reform of the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) ahead of a looming announcement on the issue.</h3>
<p><em>The Sunday Times</em> has reported that <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/20/trans-legal-gender-change-medical-diagnosis-required-sunday-times/">equalities minister Liz Truss is poised to ditch</a> plans to allow trans people to change the gender on their birth certificate without seeking approval from doctors — opting to largely ignore the results of a 2018 consultation <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/23/gender-recognition-act-reform-delayed-liz-truss-theresa-may-transphobia-trans-tory/">that found overwhelming public support</a> for the change.</p>
<p>The newspaper’s report is the latest in the series of leaks concerning GRA reform, which has faced an uncertain future and repeated delays since Truss was handed the equalities brief by Boris Johnson.</p>
<p>On Monday, a Government Equalities Office spokesperson confirmed to <em>PinkNews</em>: “The minister for women and equalities will provide the government’s response to the Gender Recognition Act this week.”</p>
<h2>Petition calls for GRA reform to continue.</h2>
<p>Ahead of the imminent announcement, a petition <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/327108">calling for the reforms to go ahead</a> has attracted more than 64,000 signatures in just over a day.</p>
<p>It states: “Reform the GRA to allow transgender people to self-identify without the need for a medical diagnosis, to streamline the administrative process, and to allow non-binary identities to be legally recognised.</p>
<p>“The response gathered by the government showed strong support for this reform with 70 per cent in favour, but the results seem to have been ignored by policy makers.</p>
<p>“The current process is distressing and often humiliating for transgender people, as well as lengthy and costly making it inaccessible to many people.</p>
<p>“Reform is needed to improve the lives of trans people, and I don’t think the proposed measures will negatively impact existing provisions under the [Equality] Act.”</p>

<p>Campaigners have long called for the UK’s gender recognition laws, which are 16 years out of date and <a href="http://pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/06/uk-european-commission-legal-gender-recognition-act-hungary-poland-trans-transgender/">do not align with international best practice</a>, to be modernised.</p>
<p>The existing laws require trans people to clear a number of hurdles to change their legal gender, including the provision of “evidence of living in an acquired gender”, submission of a medical report detailing treatment they received, and payment of a £140 fee.</p>
<p>A large percentage of trans people do not seek a gender recognition certificate due to the bureaucratic burden, medicalised process, high cost and perceived lack of benefit. Others, such as under-18s and non-binary people, are denied access to gender recognition certificates entirely.</p>
<p>A gender recognition certificate is not required to update gender on ID documents such as passports or driver’s licenses, it has no connection whatsoever to access to single-sex spaces, and it’s illegal for businesses to require one to be provided as evidence of gender.</p>
<h2>‘Trans people have waited too long for equality.’</h2>
<p>LGBT+ charity Stonewall said in a statement on Sunday: “For years, trans communities have said the GRA is outdated. The British public overwhelmingly agreed and called for reform via consultation.</p>
<p>“Trade unions and doctors just this week re-affirmed their support for reform. Trans people have waited too long for equality.</p>
<p>“Now, if today’s report is true and the government doesn’t move forward with real GRA reform it will be a bitter blow for trans people.</p>
<p>“But what hasn’t changed is trans people’s legal right to access single-sex spaces in line with the gender they identify with.”</p>
<p>Stonewall added: “This news won’t change the fact that in a landmark ruling this week, an employment tribunal decided that Equality Act protections cover non-binary and gender fluid people.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“What also won’t change is the fact that Stonewall will continue to work with trans communities and trans-led organisations to build a world where all of us can be accepted without exception. We will get there, together.”</p>
<p>Trans children’s charity Mermaids said: “After articles published today, rumours are spreading about the government’s plans for the Gender Recognition Act reform.</p>
<p>“We are patiently awaiting a formal announcement and will continue to be optimistic for the future of trans rights in the UK.”</p>
<p>“Meanwhile it’s worth repeating: trans people can already self-id for passports, driving licences and yes, access to single sex spaces. That isn’t changing. Take heart.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A BBC journalist asked the prime minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley, if people should be “allowed” to be gay – and she did not hold back.</h3>
<p>Mottley appeared on BBC News to discuss <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/16/barbados-revives-plan-to-remove-queen-as-head-of-state-and-become-a-republic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revived plans</a> for the Caribbean island to remove the queen as its head of state and become a republic.</p>
<p>In the interview with BBC journalist Christian Fraser, Mottley spoke about constitutional reform in Barbados, and the topic of LGBT+ rights came up.</p>
<p>Barbados<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/16/barbados-government-sandra-mason-same-sex-civil-unions-marriage-public-referendum-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> recently agreed to recognise same-sex civil unions</a>, as the tiny island nation <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/22/barbados-lgbt-gay-couples-visa-remote-work-welcome-stamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unpicks</a> its colonial-era homosexuality laws.</p>
<p>Although the government asserted that it is not yet allowing same-sex marriage, it has agreed to put the matter to a referendum and “be guided by the vote of the public”.</p>
<p>Referencing the upcoming referendum, Fraser asked the prime minister: “For that next generation, should they be allowed to be gay in Barbados?”</p>
<p>Looking incredulous, Mottley said: “Sorry?”</p>
<p>But Fraser persisted with the question, repeating more slowly: “Should people in Barbados be allowed to be gay, to be homosexual?”</p>
<p>Mottley, who has taken a progressive stance on LGBT+ rights in Barbados, was quick to put the journalist in his place.</p>
<p>She said: “Is that a question you would ask the United Kingdom?”</p>
<p>Fraser refused to back down, adding: “Well, we have laws on gay marriage and you’re having a referendum on gay marriage.”</p>
<p>The irony that the colonial-era laws which oppress LGBT+ people in Barbados were put in place by the British escaped the BBC journalist.</p>

<p>“I think the question is, should we discriminate against people because they’re gay? And we will not.</p>
<p>“We are absolutely clear that Barbados became the first Black slave society, and a country that has known what it is to discriminate against citizens for centuries cannot in today’s world be discriminating against any human being for any reason whatsoever.”</p>
<p>Explaining the referendum on same-sex marriage, she continued: “The government is resolute that marriage is a function of the church, and to that extent, a referendum will be held to allow all parties to determine whether they will speak on marriage or not.</p>
<p>“With respect to civil unions, we believe that that is a function of civil rights, and to that extent there shall be no discrimination against any person, whether gay, whether straight, whether Black, whether white, whether short, whether tall, for any reason in this country.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The Emmy Awards took place virtually this year on account of the pandemic, but even that couldn’t stop Billy Porter from serving an iconic look.</h3>
<p>The <em>Pose</em> star was sadly deprived of his chance to<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/02/10/billy-porter-oscars-outfits-fashion-red-carpet-elton-john-academy-awards-kensington-palace/"> strut on the red carpet</a> in front of the cameras on Sunday night (20 September), as the show took place with all <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/21/schitts-creek-emmmys-emmy-awards-dan-levy-eugene-levy-elton-john/">nominees and winners</a> appearing remotely from home –while a person in a hazmat suit stood ready at each location to hand out trophies.</p>
<p>But Porter, who was nominated for outstanding supporting actor in a drama, would never let a little thing like a global pandemic get in the way of a fashion opportunity – even if some of his previous red carpet looks, such as <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/04/billy-porter-met-gala-2019-gold-outfit/">arriving atop a throne carried by four burly men,</a> would doubtlessly fall foul of social distancing rules.</p>
<h2>Not even a pandemic can stop Billy Porter from serving looks.</h2>
<p>The actor took to Instagram to share photos of his all-white suit, accessorised with a white flowing train and silver jewellery</p>

<p>He said: “We know what’s going on in the world, so I’m trying to hold space for all things, trying to not lose my mind, trying to have fun tonight.”</p>
<p>On his Instagram Story, Porter answered questions from fans while getting ready for the ceremony.</p>
<p>Asked how he would describe his style, Porter said: “I would describe my style as free. I’ve worked a long time to find a space where I don’t care what other people think of me. That’s a real interesting and hard place to get to.</p>
<p>“I will be 51 years old tomorrow, and I’m there, I’m free. That’s how I would describe my style.”</p>
<h2><em>Pose</em> actor vows to ‘give voice to the voiceless’.</h2>
<p>Although he was ultimately beaten by Jeremy Strong of <em>Succession</em>, Porter also gave a hint of what could have been in his acceptance speech when asked about <em>Pose</em>.</p>
<p>He said: “We as artists have the power to speak truth to power, engage in really complicated conversations with the culture and reveal humanity.</p>
<p>“Never in a million years as a gay man as a gay Black man who came out in the 80s during the AIDS crisis, did I ever imagined that a show like <em>Pose</em> and a character like Pray Tell could exist. Nobody wanted to hear our story. Or so I thought.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Tyler Perry celebrated LGBT+ and BIPOC storytellers at the Emmy Awards 2020, accepting the Governor’s Ward for outstanding achievement.</h3>
<p>The filmmaker — recently coined a billionaire by <em>Forbes</em> — made history at the Emmys as the first Black person to ever be individually awarded the honour, which celebrates a talent “so extraordinary and universal in nature” it surpasses the scope of all other categories.</p>
<p>Tyler Perry accepted the award on behalf of himself and his Perry Foundation with a rousing speech which championed Black, Asian, Latin and LGBT+ filmmakers, and took the form of a deeply personal anecdote about a seemingly worthless quilt his grandmother gave him when he was 19 years old.</p>
<p>“This quilt was something I didn’t really care for,” Perry explained.</p>
<p>“It had all these different colours and these different patches in it. And I was quite embarrassed by it. I had no value in it at all.”</p>
<p>The <em>Madea</em> creator – the only winner to accept their award in person – explained how he would use his grandmother’s quilt to dry off his dog and to lie on when changing the oil in his car.</p>
<p>“I had no respect for this quilt,” he continued.</p>
<p>“Many years later, as I was walking past those fancy antique stores that I could finally go in and shop, I saw in the window a quilt that looked just like the one that she had given me.”</p>
<p>In the store, an attendant approached Perry and told him the significance of this quilt. It had been sewn by a Black American woman who had formerly been enslaved. Each patch was part of the tapestry of her life: from a square of the dress she had been wearing when she learned she was a free woman, to a patch taken from the wedding dress she wore as she “jumped the broom”.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I dismissed her work and her story because it didn’t look like what I thought it should.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>“And as I was hearing this story, I became so embarrassed,” he continued. “Here I was, a person who prides myself on celebrating our heritage, our culture, and I didn’t even recognise the value in my grandmother’s quilt.</p>
<p>“I dismissed her work and her story because it didn’t look like what I thought it should. Now, whether we know it or not, we are all sewing our own quilts with our thoughts, our behaviours, our experiences and our memories.”</p>
<p>In his own quilt, Perry said, would be a memory of his father standing by the front door, waiting for the white man who employed him to deliver his wages. He never did, and Perry recalled his mother saying: “Don’t you ever stand by a door waiting for white folks to do nothing for you.”</p>
<p>Though Perry’s mother “wasn’t a racist”, he explained, it was impossible for her to imagine her son breaking free of the system which had oppressed her own family ofor generations.</p>
<p>“In my mother’s quilt, she couldn’t imagine me owning land that was once a Confederate Army base where Confederate soldiers plotted and planned on how to keep Blacks enslaved,” he said, referring to his 330-acre Tyler Perry Studios, America’s largest film production studio and the only one owned outright by an African American person.</p>
<p>“And now, on that very land, Black people, white people, gay, straight, lesbian, transgender, ex-cons, Latin, Asian, all of us, come together, working,” he concluded.</p>
<p>“All coming together to add patches to a quilt that is as diverse as it can be. Diversity at its best.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Zendaya won her first Emmy at the virtual 2020 ceremony, taking home Best Drama Actress for her part in <em>Euphoria</em>.</h3>
<p>Zendaya, 24, made history as the category’s youngest-ever winner, beating off competition from industry stalwarts Olivia Colman (<em>The Crown</em>), Jennifer Aniston (<em>The Morning Show</em>), Laura Linney (<em>Ozark</em>) and last-year’s winner – who held the previous record at 26 years old – Jodie Comer (<em>Killing Eve)</em>.</p>
<p>The <em>Euphoria</em> star also becomes only the second Black woman to win the category in the Emmys’ 71-year history, after Viola Davis (<em>How to Get Away With Murder</em>, in 2015).</p>
<p>Zendaya accepted her Emmy from home surrounded by family, supporters and her dog Noon.</p>
<p>“This is pretty crazy, I don’t really cry,” she said, visibly shaken, to a chorus of screams.</p>

<p>The actor, who plays queer teen Rue on the hit HBO series, thanked her <em>Euphoria</em> colleagues who she said she was “lucky” to work with every day.</p>
<p>“I’m inspired by every thing that you do,” she added.</p>
<p>Zendaya has been a vocal advocate for Black Lives Matter and nodded to the current social and political climate in her Emmys speech, paying tribute to young activists.</p>
<p>“I know this feels like is a really weird time to be celebrating,” she said. “But I just want to say there is hope in the young people out there, I know that our TV show doesn’t always feel like a great example of that, but there is hope in the young people.”</p>
<p>She added: “To all my peers out there doing the work in the streets: I see you, I admire you, I thank you.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Beloved comedy series <em>Schitt</em>‘s <em>Creek</em> has shattered records with a clean sweep at the Emmy Awards, winning all of the major comedy categories.</h3>
<p>The show’s co-creator and star Dan Levy gave a number of emotional speeches at the ceremony, held <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL8EVXx8Si0&feature=youtu.be">virtually</a> on Sunday night, as the show’s final season picked up a record nine awards — the most ever for a comedy show in a single year.</p>
<p>As well as picking up the awards for best comedy series, outstanding writing and outstanding directing, the show’s cast swept all of the comedic acting categories — with Eugene Levy winning for lead actor, Catherine O’Hara winning for lead actress, Dan Levy winning for supporting actor, and Annie Murphy wining for supporting actress.</p>
<h2>Schitt’s Creek ‘is a castigation of homophobia’.</h2>
<p>Accepting the award for outstanding comedy series, Dan Levy said: “This show at its core is about the transformational effects of love and acceptance, and that is something that we need more of now than we’ve ever needed before.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to say for any of you who have not registered to vote, please do so, and then go out and vote because that is the only way that we are going to have some love and acceptance out there.”</p>

<p>His father, co-creator and co-star Eugene Levy paid an emotional tribute to his son, adding: “I want to thank once again this young man who took our fish-out-of-water story about the Rose family and transformed it into a celebration of inclusivity, a castigation of homophobia, and a declaration of the power of love.”</p>
<h2>Elton John makes a surprise appearance at Emmy Awards to praise record-breaking show.</h2>
<p>The cast also received a surprise message from Elton John during the ceremony, who said: “I love Schitt’s Creek for its big Canadian heart, but three things really made the show an all-time favourite of mine.</p>
<p>“One, they name-checked me in an episode, two I met the cast after one of my shows in Italy, and three, Daniel Levy was named after one of my songs. I challenge any other nominated comedy to top that!”</p>

<p>After the show’s finale earlier this year,<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/08/schitts-creek-finale-season-6-legacy-lgbt/"> Dan Levy spoke about the many parents who wrote to thank them</a> for helping understand and embrace their children’s identity.</p>
<p>Levy said it is “the greatest takeaway I could have ever imagined from this show”.</p>
<p>“I just think back to times in my life when I was still in the closet and really struggling, and thinking if I was going to be able to live an open and authentic life myself,” he told GLAAD.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“It is such a stark discrepancy between who I was as a teenager and who I am now.</p>
<p>“I am really proud of the work that we did, and I am humbled by the change that we seem to have affected in people’s lives and people’s homes.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Mr Gay England, one of the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/08/09/mr-gay-england-crowned-the-winner-of-mr-gay-europe/">top beauty pageants</a> in Britain for LGBT+ men, shut down bristling transphobes Thursday (17 September) amid a backlash against a gay trans finalist.</h3>
<p>Chiyo Gomes, a 24-year-old drag artist well known among London’s queer performance scene, became a finalist for Mr Gay England 2020 in August.</p>
<p>But what was a cause for celebration quickly saw Gomes caught in the crosshairs of transphobes, determined to stymie his bid to be crowned the winner.</p>
<p>The contest’s organisers took to <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgayengland/status/1306620479055237121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> to respond to the criticism with a powerful and clear message: “The Mr Gay England cooperation are PROUD to welcome any gay man to compete for one of our national titles.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">

Simples.”</p>
<h2><strong>Chiyo Gomes wants to make ‘queerstory’ as first trans Mr Gay England. </strong></h2>
<p>Established in 2016, Mr Gay England judges assess the roster of finalists based on an array of criteria, from swimwear to formalwear, as well as an audience vote and a “congeniality” vote – the contestants themselves decide who should win.</p>
<p>Finalists are also judged on how much money they raise for two charities – <a href="https://charliecookson.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Charlie and Carter Foundation</a> for seriously ill children with life-limiting conditions, and the mental health charity <a href="https://www.northern-pride.com/health/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Northern Pride Health Zone</a>.</p>
<p>Mr Gay England’s grand final will be held at Boulevard Theatre, Newcastle Upon Tyne on 1 April 2021.</p>
<p>Being a finalist in a competition traditionally snarled by stale masculine ideals was “major”, Gomes said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-XdtUfzgoE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a> tagged alongside his fundraising page.</p>
<p>“Imagine how delicious it would be if we made queerstory and I was the first trans man to win Mr Gay England. To hold that title. To take up that space.”</p>

<p>“It is often the case with change that there will be a ‘push back’ in some form or other,” Stuart Hatton, Mr Gay England’s CEO, told <em>PinkNews</em>.</p>
<p>“But it is through small steps like this that we start to see positive change. Our community is always evolving and developing and is, for the most part, accepting and open.</p>
<p>“We hope those who are critical of our decision will follow the competition and see that by accepting and nurturing all those in our community we can become stronger and more representative.”</p>
<p>Mr Gay England’s statement of solidarity with the trans community and its defiance to secede to transphobes drew praise on Twitter.</p>

<p>“You don’t just deserve to be a finalist in Mr Gay England, for example, you deserve a crown,” he said.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>The governor of the Cayman Islands has pleaded with people to be kind to each other, just a week after leaked messages from a Christian WhatsApp group showed members threatening to “lovingly” hang “one or two gays”.</h3>
<p>Governor Martyn Roper said recent public discussion about LGBT+ people had been “irresponsible” and “shocking” during a COVID-19 press briefing on Friday (September 18).</p>
<p>While Roper did not name <a href="https://www.caymancompass.com/2020/09/10/disturbing-and-dangerous-messages-scare-lgbtq-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cayman Caribbean Cause</a>, the Christian group in question, he made a plea for people to treat each other with dignity and respect.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen a number of comments made on WhatsApp in recent days about the Civil Partnership Bill that I feel are deeply irresponsible. In fact, I find them quite shocking. The worst ones have been referred to the police to look into,” said Roper, according to the <a href="https://www.caymancompass.com/2020/09/19/governor-anti-lgbtq-comments-irresponsible-and-shocking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cayman Compass.</em></a></p>
<p>“I’m not going to single out individuals or organisations but I call on both sides of this debate to lower the temperature and please think twice before posting anything on social media that would offend others in our community.”</p>
<p>The messages, which show an incomplete snippet of a discussion about gay and LGBT+ rights, are from members of Cayman Caribbean Cause – a Christian group that includes prominent leaders from the church community in the Cayman Islands, which are a British Overseas Territory.</p>
<p>In one, a member suggests “maybe hang one or two [gay people] in a loving way” as a warning to others.</p>
<p>Another message suggested implementing teachings from the Quran to criminalise homosexuality, reading: “If this was a Muslim country, they’d be [thrown] out by the thousands.”</p>
<p>Roper later added that copies of the leaked WhatsApp messages had been received by Police Commissioner Derek Byrne and were “being looked at”.</p>
<p>Same-sex marriage was legalised in the Cayman Islands in 2019, following a lawsuit by a lesbian couple. However later that year, <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/11/08/cayman-islands-legalisation-same-sex-overturned-legal-illegal-court-appeals-lesbian-couple-british-territory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the islands’ government won an appeal to overturn the legalisation.</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Pete Buttigieg, the first openly gay presidential candidate for a major party, has one message for LGBT+ youth in the run up to the US election: Vote.</h3>
<p>Buttigieg, the gay mayor from Indiana who was the surprise break-out star of the Democratic race earlier this year, has <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/03/joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-beau-endorsement-democratic-presidential-race-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thrown his weight</a> behind Joe Biden’s bid to get Donald Trump out of the White House.</p>
<p>And in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/18/pete-buttigieg-interview-joe-biden-donald-trump-lgbtq-gay-rights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, the 38-year-old has spoken out about how this year’s US election is both political and deeply personal.</p>
<p>“When you see your own rights come up for debate, when you know something as intimate and central to your life as the existence of your family is something that is not supported by your president, and certainly your vice-president, it’s painful,” Pete Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>“It creates a sense of urgency that I hope will motivate many people – including a lot of LGBTQ younger people who maybe weren’t deciding so much how to vote as they were whether to vote – to see now is the time to vote like your life depends on it.”</p>
<p>Buttigieg’s history-making run to be the first openly gay US president <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/03/02/pete-buttigieg-drops-out-presidential-race-first-openly-gay-major-candidate-democratic-nomination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ended</a> in March, after his campaign suffered heavy losses in South Carolina during the primary. He’s since been <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/07/joe-biden-pete-buttigieg-presidency-transition-team-us-election-2020-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tapped</a> to serve in a key role on the presidential transition team of his former rival Joe Biden.</p>
<p>Despite Trump’s claims to support LGBT+ rights, Buttigieg said he’s very aware of how fragile the rights he and his husband, Chasten, enjoy are, saying he’s “mindful every day” that their marriage was possible “by the grace of one vote on our Supreme Court”.</p>
<p>Pete Buttigieg continued: “[Trump has] rarely missed an opportunity to attack the community, especially trans people, whether we’re talking about the ban on military service or issues around healthcare.</p>
<p>“But even for same-sex international adoption, this administration has taken us in the wrong direction and four more years would be a tremendous setback.</p>
<p>“Also around the world, we’re seeing, for example in eastern Europe, really disturbing setbacks in LGBTQ rights and equality without a strong United States leading the way in human rights, which requires leadership and credibility and also that we’re doing the right thing here at home.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>RuPaul has smashed records with a fifth Emmy win, dedicating his victory to the late <em>Drag Race</em> queen Chi Chi DeVayne.</h3>
<p>RuPaul’s record-breaking fifth consecutive win at the Emmys came yesterday in the Television Academy’s outstanding host for a reality or competition program category.</p>
<p>The drag superstar has won the category more times than anyone else in its 13-year history.</p>
<p>“On behalf of VH1, World of Wonder, and our incredible cast and crew, I want to thank the Academy for this great honour,” RuPaul said in a televised acceptance speech.</p>
<p>“I’ve always said, every time I bat my false eyelashes, I’m making a political statement. Well, tonight, the only political statement I want to make is this: Love.</p>
<p>“Love for our LGBT brothers and sisters, love for Black queens and brown queens, and love for the United States of America, where a little gay boy with nothing more than a pussycat wig and a dream can build an international platform that celebrates sweet, sensitive souls everywhere.”</p>
<p>In his acceptance speech, RuPaul went on to dedicate his achievement to the legendary queen Chi Chi DeVayne, who <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/08/20/chi-chi-devayne-dead-death-rupauls-drag-race-zavion-davenport-pneumonia-hospital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tragically died</a> at just 34 years old after battling pneumonia.</p>
<p>Urging viewers to vote on November 3, he continued: “I’d like to dedicate this Emmy to one of my girls, Chi Chi DeVayne. May you rest in power and perfection.”</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>A restaurant in India completely run by trans staff that opened during the COVID-19 pandemic has become so successful that it is already opening a second location.</h3>
<p>The Covai Trans Kitchen opened in the <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/08/21/indian-city-to-hold-second-pride-parade-after-only-nine-people-attended-last-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coimbatore</a> district when Sangeetha, president of the Transgender Association of Coimbatore, noticed the impact of the pandemic on the area’s already struggling trans community.</p>
<p>To help tackle joblessness due to COVID-19, a problem that has hit the trans community especially hard, the 32-seater restaurant has a fully trans staff.</p>
<p>Sangeetha told <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/trans-kitchen-coimbatore-woos-diners-biryani-and-more-6588930/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Indian Express</em></a>: “Catering is our primary business. But due to Covid-19, many of the restaurants where our community members were working had been closed. They were jobless.</p>
<p>“So, we thought we should open a small kitchen that would beneficial to everyone.</p>
<p>“Through the Transgender Association of Coimbatore, ten of our members have joined here.</p>
<p>“The kitchen is run entirely by them right from preparing the food, to packaging and delivery.”</p>

<p>But, she said, finding a location to open the Covai Trans Kitchen was initially very difficult, as transphobic landlords did not want to rent them a space.</p>
<p>“Our restaurant is the first in the state that is run entirely run by the transgender community members,” Sangeetha said.</p>
<p>“People were hesitant to provide us a space for rent, some of them told they are not sure how we are going to run a restaurant all by ourselves as it has not been done before.</p>
<p>“After a long struggle, with the help of a lawyer, we found a place in RS Puram.”</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>But as soon as it opened the restaurant was a hit, and a second location will hopefully follow in the next few months.</p>
<p>Sangeetha added: “Public and local media has been very kind to us. With their support, we are able to attract more customers.</p>
<p>“We have started receiving bulk orders, up to 15 kgs of biryani is sold on a daily basis.</p>
<p>“After six months, if the business continues to provide good profit, we are planning to open a second unit to provide more job opportunities to our community members.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Anti-LGBT+ campaigners have accused Burger King of selling out to “the left’s sexual agenda” over an advert that features the Burger King kissing Ronald McDonald.</h3>
<p>The two iconic mascots <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/11/burger-king-ronald-mcdonald-kiss-pride-advert-helsinki/">put aside their decades-long rivalry for the advert</a>, installed by Burger King around <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/07/02/finland-helsinki-pride-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helsinki</a>, Finland, to mark the city’s 2020 Pride week.</p>
<p>The ad, which features the pair sharing an intimate kiss under the banner “love conquers all”, has been warmly received online.</p>
<h2>Peter LaBarbera, a very angry man, is very angry about burgers.</h2>
<p>However, the message that was apparently too much for <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2018/04/06/why-doesnt-he-get-aids-an-anti-lgbt-evangelical-reviewed-love-simon-and-it-was-wild/">Peter LaBarbera</a> of the anti-gay lobbying group <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/10/12/conservative-activist-wants-gay-star-trek-characters-to-cure-their-homosexuality/">Americans for Truth About Homosexuality</a>, who lashed out with a predictably level of anger.</p>
<p>LaBarbera complained: “It’s sad because woke corporations are now in the vanguard of cultural Marxism</p>
<p>“This stunt by Burger King has nothing to do with selling burgers and fries and everything to do with selling perversion and the left’s sexual agenda.”</p>

<p>Speaking to evangelical outlet <em><a href="https://onenewsnow.com/business/2020/09/15/burger-chains-confusing-love-and-perversion">OneNewsNow</a></em>, LaBarbera raged: “This isn’t about love. This is about perversion.</p>
<p>“And the question is will cultural Marxism and sexual perversion conquer truth and our Biblical Judeo-Christian values that have made America strong but are now under withering attacks by these leftists.”</p>
<p>Peter, you’re yelling at cheeseburgers.</p>
<h2>Burger King ‘wanted to show that love always wins’.</h2>
<p>“Burger King has always stood for equality, love, and everyone’s right to be just the way they are,” the chain’s brand manager Kaisa Kasila said in a statement.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>“We thought, what a better way to convey our values than by portraying an all-encompassing kiss between Burger King and McDonald.</p>
<p>“We wanted to show that in the end, love always wins. And we know McDonald’s stands for the values we stand for, too.”</p>
<p>The campaign was plastered around the city, and is also featured in print advertising and on the fast food giant’s restaurants and other channels.</p>
<p>It comes after the chain’s Mexican operation renamed itself Burger Queer during Pride Month.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>At least 63 LGBT+ people were killed in Colombia in the first eight months of the year as acts of violence increased during the pandemic.</h3>
<p>Among those killed were 17 transgender women, 12 gay men, six lesbian women and one transgender man, as well as several other members of the LGBT+ community whose sexual orientation or gender identity was not specified.</p>
<p>The disturbing figures were published in a report from the country’s human rights ombudsman on Tuesday (September 15), <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-colombia-lgbt/more-than-60-lgbt-intersex-people-killed-in-colombia-in-first-eight-months-of-2020-idUKKBN266360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported.</p>
<p>“During the pandemic prejudice and discrimination have been exacerbated while obstacles to accessing justice in the receiving of complaints increased,” the ombudsman said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition there were 388 cases of violence against LGBT+ people between January and August, mostly in the form of physical and psychological aggressions. This represents a considerable increase from the year before, when there were 309 cases for the whole 12-month period.</p>
<p>The ombudsman also cites 36 cases of aggression by police officers, a figure supported by previous reports of a rise in attacks fuelled by <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/08/colombia-bogota-coronavirus-gendered-lockdown-rise-transphobic-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gender-based lockdown laws</a>.</p>
<p>The policy known as <em>pico y género</em> (peak and gender) was introduced in the country’s capital, Bogotá, in an effort to limit the number of people on the streets. Women were permitted to go outdoors for essential tasks on even-numbered days, while men had odd-numbered days.</p>

<p>The mayor assured trans people they would be treated in accordance with their gender identity and city authorities said no one would be asked to show proof of gender, but human rights groups reported that the policy triggered acts of transphobic aggression from police and the public.</p>
<p>In May the group Red Comunitaria Trans <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-latam-lgbt/transgender-people-face-discrimination-violence-amid-latin-american-quarantines-idUKKBN22H2PV" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Reuters</em></a> it had received 18 discrimination complaints since the measure began, one being from a transgender woman who was stabbed by a man who said she was out on the wrong day.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/04/15/coronavirus-peru-gender-based-lockdown-rules-trans-community-backlash-alexandra-arana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gender-based lockdown in Peru</a> was lifted early after similar incidents of transphobia, violence and public humiliation were reported across the country.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Trans adults will continue to need a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria to change their legal gender even after a reform of the UK’s gender-recognition laws, the <em>Sunday Times</em> <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/changing-gender-to-get-cheaper-but-self-identify-scheme-is-off-0twtdw5fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claims</a>.</h3>
<p>Legal gender recognition for adult trans men and women in the UK is governed by the 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA).</p>
<p>Planned updates to the GRA to make it more accessible for trans people have been repeatedly delayed for two years amid a <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/23/gender-recognition-act-reform-delayed-liz-truss-theresa-may-transphobia-trans-tory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">toxic public debate about trans rights</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/06/14/trans-self-id-uk-boris-johnson-liz-truss-gender-recognition-act-leak-sunday-times/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> in June that plans for GRA reform were being scrapped entirely, but subsequent statements from Boris Johnson and his minister for women and equalities Liz Truss suggest this was incorrect.</p>
<p>Fears that the Tories would use GRA reform to restrict access to healthcare for trans youth were also allayed earlier this month when Truss confirmed, in a letter to trans-support charity Mermaids, that any changes to gender-recognition laws will <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/10/gender-recognition-act-reform-healthcare-transgender-trans-liz-truss-mermaids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not affect under 18’s</a>.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> today reports that GRA reform will include reducing the £140 fee for legal gender recognition but the requirement for trans people to have a gender dysphoria diagnosis will remain.</p>
<p>One unnamed government source told the newspaper: “We think that the current legislation, which supports people’s rights to change their sex, is sufficient.”</p>
<h2>Doctors back trans people self-declaring their gender.</h2>
<p>The British Medical Association (BMA), the UK’s professional association for doctors, this week <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/16/british-medical-association-trans-non-binary-self-declare-gender-recognitio-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passed a historic motion backing trans people</a> being able to legally self-declare their gender without a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.</p>
<p>The BMA also <a href="https://www.bma.org.uk/bma-media-centre/leading-doctors-affirm-trans-and-non-binary-rights-in-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called on the government to ensure the rights of trans and non-binary people</a> in accessing healthcare.</p>
<p>The heated public debate over whether trans and non-binary people should be allowed to self-declare their gender (a system in place in dozens of other countries including Ireland, Malta and Argentina) had put doctors in a “weird position where we’re expected to define what is a valid transition”, Dr Grace Allport, who wrote the BMA motion, told <em>PinkNews</em>.</p>
<p>“We end up as gatekeepers, not just of healthcare but of what is ‘male’ and ‘female’,” Allport said. “It doesn’t feel like a role doctors should be doing – it doesn’t feel like something anyone should be doing for anyone else.”</p>
<h2>Reforming the UK’s Gender Recognition Act.</h2>
<p>In 2017, then-prime minister Theresa May suggested reforming the GRA after a government report found that only around 5,000 people from the UK’s trans population of roughly half a million people had used the law to change their legal gender.</p>
<p>A huge public consultation on potential reforms of the GRA was held in 2018, with trans activists calling for legal recognition for non-binary trans people, access to legal gender recognition for trans 16- and 17-year-olds, and demedicalising and streamlining the gender recognition process.</p>
<p>A key demand was for the requirement of a medical diagnosis for legal gender recognition to be removed, with May saying that “being trans is not an illness”.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>In 2019, the World Health Organization <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/05/27/world-health-organisation-transgender-mental-disorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dropped being trans from its list of mental disorders</a>.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have repeatedly delayed publishing the results of this consultation, which was reportedly responded to by more than 100,000 people, but equalities chief Liz Truss promised in July that she would publish both the results and her plan for reforming the GRA “<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/07/22/nadia-whittome-liz-truss-gender-recognition-act-delay-transgender-rights-labour-tory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the summer</a>“.</p>
<p>The <em>Sunday Times</em> reports today that this reform will not include demedicalising the process, as trans campaigners had demanded, meaning that trans people will continue to need a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria before being able to update the gender marker on their birth certificate.</p>
<p>This change is needed for the administration of taxes, pensions and marriages. It does not affect trans people’s ability to update the gender marker on other documents such as passports or bank accounts, which is possible without going through the process of legal gender recognition, or access to public single-sex spaces like bathrooms.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Police in Mexico have arrested a man in connection with the fatal stabbing of trans activist Mireya Rodriguez Lemus.</h3>
<p>Lemus, a trans woman from Chihuahua state, was found stabbed to death in her home in Aquiles Serdan, outside Chihuahua City, on <a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/09/10/mexico-trans-murder-transphobia-hate-crime-leslie-rocha-mireya-rodriguez-lemus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 2</a>.</p>
<p>She was the founder of Unión y Fuerza de Mujeres Trans Chihuahuenses (Union and Force of Chihuahua Trans Women), a support group for trans women, as well as a campaigner for AIDS prevention and education.</p>
<p>The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in Mexico condemned her murder and called for an investigation into whether she was killed because of her human-rights activism or in a hate crime, the <a href="https://eu.elpasotimes.com/story/news/crime/2020/09/18/mexico-transgender-lgbt-activist-mireya-rodriguez-lemus-killed-arrest-chihuahua/5806917002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>El Paso Times</em></a> reports.</p>
<p>The UN added that Lemus was one of at least seven human-rights activists murdered in Mexico this year.</p>
<p>Last week, a man named as Ivan Arturo G.P. – in Mexico, authorities do not fully name all crime suspects – was arrested by state investigators on gender-related aggravated homicide and aggravated robbery charges.</p>
<p>The attorney general’s office said that Lemus was “violently” stabbed to death in her home on August 30, and that her car and cellphone were stolen. It did not say whether it believed she was targeted for being LGBT+.</p>
<p>It’s been <a href="https://www.ebar.com/news/news//297239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that she received death threats in the weeks leading up to her death and went to local police, who declined to investigate.</p>
<p>At least four transgender women are believed to have been murdered in Ciudad Juarez so far this year, but activists say police are reluctant to treat the killings as hate crimes, and often attempt to pass them off as drug-related.</p>
<h2>Murder is a gruesome reality for LGBT+ people in Mexico.</h2>
<p>Data previously collated by LGBT+ anti-violence group Letra Esse<a href="https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/05/16/mexico-lgbt-murders-117-letra-esse-report-2019-trans-women-reuters/"> suggested that at least 117 LGBT+ people were brutally murdered in Mexico</a> in 2019, in what activists are dubbing the deadliest year on record in half a decade.</p>
<p>The report by<a href="http://www.letraese.org.mx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Letra Esse</a> showed that the surge was up nearly a third (27 per cent) from 2018 and the highest figure since 2015. The group warned, however, that real figure might be even higher.</p>
<p>Trans women – one of the most vulnerable and marginalised communities in Mexico – accounted for more than half of the murders, the group said. A third of the victims were gay men.</p><section class="flatplan-stack" data-stack-id="pn-read-next">

<p>Letra Esse director Alejandro Brito said: “We’ve documented that victims are subjected to multiple forms of violence, before or even after they were murdered.</p>
<p>“There is a cruelty towards the victims.”</p>
