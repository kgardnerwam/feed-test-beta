            <![CDATA[ <p>It hasn&#039;t aired a new episode since 2010 – but fans of <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/whats-on-tv/"><em><strong>Heartbeat</strong></em></a> are enjoying reminiscing over the family-favourite police drama thanks to re-runs on ITV3. Set in Yorkshire in the 1960s, Heartbeat followed the lives of a group of policemen and women in the Aidensfield and Ashfordly area.</p> <p>But what have the stars of the show been up to in the 28 years since they wrapped the series? <strong>Let&#039;s take a look…</strong></p> <p> </p> <h2>Nick Berry</h2> <p><strong>Nick Berry</strong> played PC Nick Rowan in Heartbeat for six years from series one to series seven – he even sang the theme tune to the show! Following his character&#039;s exit – he left for Canada – Nick had a successful career as a singer. His other most notable role included playing Simon Wicks in <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/tags/eastenders/"><em><strong>EastEnders</strong></em></a> from 1985 to 1990. He retired from acting in 2012 to be a stay-at-home father to his two sons.</p> <p><strong>MORE: </strong><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/film/2020090196319/heartbeat-what-happened-to-derek-fowlds/"><strong>Find out what happened to Heartbeat actor Derek Fowlds</strong></a></p> ]]>
