<p>In 2013, <a href="/art-photography/12605/ilyes-griyeb-photography-sale-of-parisian-youth-adama-traore"><strong>Ilyes Griyeb</strong></a> – then an art director – started getting acquainted with Morocco. His father, who was born in Morocco but emigrated to France as a young man, bought a farm in Meknès and, after spending some time there, Griyeb began photographing his family and friends. “It was a very natural way of starting a new career,” he tells AnOther. “I came to realise that most of the people photographing Morocco were foreigners, [who were] exoticising the visual potential of the country rather than connecting with its society. That’s how the idea of doing a portrait series about youth began.”</p>
<p>By the following year, this project had evolved into the idea for a book (“I even had the cover design in mind back then,” Griyeb says). His subjects’ backstories had become more diverse, and a narrative thread had begun to emerge. “I don’t think of myself as a classic documentary photographer,” Griyeb continues. “I want to photograph the truth, but in a way that it becomes appealing rather than bleak. Whatever people want to give me, I accept.”</p>
<p>With a distinct style somewhere between realism, portrait and fashion photography, complete with a vibrant colour treatment, the 74 images that compose the book offer a telling glimpse into the lives of Morocco’s young people. Here, Ilyes explains the interlacing stories behind his snapshots.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>“My original idea was delving into a reflection of Morocco’s youth, but I soon realised it wasn’t a monolith. There are two types of young people in Meknès: one lives in the traditional way, working in agriculture, marrying early, taking life one day at a time; the other looks up to the American dream or, more accurately, the European dream. They’re all about appearance, social media, capitalist values. So I started documenting the way they coexist in a bit of a tightrope, and the underlying tension between them.</em></p>
<p><em>“This phenomenon is deeply connected with the history of Moroccan emigration, which started in the late 70s and early 80s. Growing up, these millennial Moroccan kids would see their émigré compatriots coming back for the summer holidays with their expensive cars, and they dreamed of doing – and having – the same things. Fast forward to today, they exist in this dissonant world in which they pretend to live in abundance – buying iPhones and motorbikes, often between several of them to be able to afford them – yet they are broke, mostly still living with their parents and working jobs they find humiliating, spending every dirham they earn in luxury brands.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“This obviously creates an intergenerational conflict, but also a strained relationship with their peers who have chosen a different life and who, funnily enough, have a bigger buying power even though their dreams are way more modest. It might look like these are two completely opposite directions, but the truth is they are both a portrait of the same reality, in which cultural trends don’t align with the country’s economic condition.</em></p>
<p><em>“Most of the people I portray are people I know or friends of friends. I’m not into doing castings for my photos; I’d rather just meet people, get to know them and then spontaneously decide to take their picture. I’m not trying to uncover any hidden facts. Whatever people want to transmit to my camera, I take at face value. There’s an authenticity to that innocence; in a way it’s like sitting back and letting a society unravel. It also makes my work somewhat sociological, and deeply personal too. Because, through these portraits and a few scattered landscape pictures, I feel like I have gotten to know my own history better, from who I am and where I come from, to why my parents educated me the way they did.”</em></p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>In his new film, <strong><em>Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds</em></strong>, Werner Herzog explores the raw beauty and cosmic power of meteorites. The science documentary, co-directed by Cambridge University geographer and seismologist Clive Oppenheimer, traces the fascinating ways in which fragments of rocks from outer space have made renowned impressions far beyond the edges of any individual crater.</p>
<p>On 7 November 1492, the first recorded meteorite crashed into earth in the form of a fiery space rock shooting through the sky. It punched a hole three feet deep into the soil of a wheat field near French town Ensisheim, with a young boy as its only witness, as history recalls. At the time, the remarkable force of the meteorite impressed Austrian military commander, King Maximilian, who came to the town to battle the French a week after its arrival. He <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992Metic..27...28M">labelled it “a sign of divine favor”</a> – Herzog and Oppenheimer’s <em>Fireball</em> helps us understand why.</p>
<p>“Somebody asked me ‘what’s the interest in this, they’re just lifeless rocks these meteorites?’ But the thing is they’re anything but lifeless,” says Oppenheimer. “Some of them are stuffed full of organic molecules and might be the building blocks of life. And of course, from time to time they barrel into our planet and reset the biological clock as they did 65 million years ago with the asteroid’s impact. So I think what fascinates us about them is how interwoven the nature of these stones or shooting stars impact the human nature that surrounds them.”</p>
<p>While the examination of meteorites is a scientific matter, there is also a spiritual element to it. In the documentary we’re shown how they exert their energy upon the earth, not only through multiple interviews with many eclectic people who study the larger-than-life forces but through breathtaking footage of fire light meteorites dashing across the sky and lunging towards earth.</p>
<p>“There are so many films that have been made for TV documentaries on meteorites, as well as Hollywood movies like <em>Deep Impact</em>, and others that look at the doomsday scenario, but I think what Werner and I achieve is a gripping new form of science documentary which is about the human stories not just the science,” Oppenheimer explains. “It asks what is the significance of this crater for the aboriginal communities? What are the oral traditions that they’ve had about it for thousands of years? Why is there what is most likely a meteorite set in the centre of the Great Mosque of Mecca and why is this one of the holiest realms of Islam? Supposedly the stone was brought to Ibrahim by the angel Gabriel and it was given to set in the Kaaba.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="K4X9fQsiAOQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4X9fQsiAOQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>In the film, we’re shown shaky footage of the Black Stone, a sacred rock in the city of Mecca that Muslims circle around during Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage that is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims to carry out at least once in their lifetime. Scientists have never been allowed to study the Black Stone but it is believed by researchers to be a meteorite. “These are things that I don’t think everyone is aware of,” adds Herzog. “I don’t think many are aware that people have found sugars in meteorites or that you can pick them up and they smell like the inside of a vacuum cleaner. That smell is four and a half million years old. It’s how the universe smelt 4,500 million years ago.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot to digest in the hour and 37 minutes long journey narrated by Herzog’s famous voice-over. Herzog and Oppenheimer, who previously worked together on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoSmPkWmG4k"><em>Into the Inferno</em></a> in 2016, delve into the different impact craters around the world. From the Polo Plato in Antarctica, a vast expanse of blue ice with only a handful of people scattered out looking for meteorites, to beside the sea on Meer Island in Torres Strait between Queensland and New Guinea, where we’re shown locals performing a meteorites dance. As Oppenheimer explains, “The Meer islanders believe that the souls of the departed climb up a coconut palm and launch across the night sky, so when they see a shooting star it indicates that someone has died or will die soon and this is enacted with fire torches by night.”</p>
<p>For Herzog, it is the different forms and sizes that fascinate him the most. “I praise micro meteorites when they’re microscopically small, it’s incredible,” he says. “But then in large they are the most beautiful sculptures. I mean the film holds its breath and it stops as it shows one after the other, they’re so beautiful.”</p>
<p>In <em>Fireball</em>, meteorites are more than flaming rocks from outer space. They write history and birth traditions and that, Herzog suggests, is why they’re worshipped. The film, which is now streaming on Apple TV, is full of contrast – visually, narratively and cinematically – yet there are interconnecting themes throughout. “It’s very easy as a storyteller to immediately know if something is big,” says Herzog. “This movie is big.”</p>

<p>There are two qualities, I think, that are important to mention straightaway about <strong>Lynne Tillman</strong>, in part because they are so disarming in a distinguished cultural critic, novelist and New York institution. The first is that Tillman is very funny, with a self-deprecating wit that she aptly calls “gallows humour”. She is also uncommonly inquisitive, especially by the standards of an interview subject, with a habit of turning your question back over to you.</p>
<p>We speak over the phone on the day of the US election, to discuss Tillman’s novel <a href="https://peninsulapress.co.uk/product/men-and-apparitions"><em>Men and Apparitions</em></a>. Published in the US in 2018, and brought out in the UK this month by Peninsula Press, it’s the first of her books to be published here since the early 2000s, and her first novel in 12 years. (Though she brought out several books and taught too, in the interim. “Was it 12 years?” she says. “Well believe me, I wasn’t idle.”) The author of 15 books in total, since the late 80s Tillman has been a prolific and original writer of both fiction and criticism. Her 2014 collection of essays <em>What Would Lynne Tillman Do, </em>2006 novel <em>American Genius: A Comedy</em>, and recent work for<em> Frieze</em> in particular have brought her work to the attention of new generations of readers.</p>
<p>Initially conceived as a story about living in a glut of images, <em>Men and Apparitions </em>centres around 38-year-old visual culture anthropologist Ezekiel ‘Zeke’ Hooper Stark as he interrogates his history, practice, and the breakdown of his marriage. “He’s self-conscious, and like many self-conscious people he doesn’t know himself,” says Tillman. “In America people are teenagers when they’re 38 still.” Interwoven with meditations, or mini-essays, on the meaning of photography and images, the novel is a deft consideration of intimacy, self and gender, in particular contemporary masculinity. Arguably ethnographic in parts itself, <em>Men and Apparitions </em>concludes with a field study, ‘Men in Quotes’, with answers lifted directly from a real survey that Tillman sent out to roughly 40 of her male acquaintances.</p><p><strong>Holly Connolly: When I spoke to your publisher he pointed out how much affection there is for you in the States. He said something that I loved, which was that one American bookseller had told him, “Everyone has a Lynne Tillman story.”</strong></p>
<p>Lynne Tillman: Everyone has a story? Well I’d like to hear them! You should ask him if he remembers any of the stories, I hope they’re salacious!</p>
<p><strong>HC: Part of the novel is set in London, and it’s a section that reads very authentically. You lived in London and Europe for a time, right?</strong></p>
<p>L: London is very important to me. I was there in my twenties for quite a while and it’s where I began to kind of take myself apart and put myself back together differently. Amsterdam also, I was going back and forth between the two and coming to terms with the fact that if I thought I could be this ‘great writer’ then I’d better get started. And I couldn’t do it in Europe, somehow, it was a language issue in part. I was hearing English spoken by the English, and it’s a very different language in a way. So I was really not getting it together in Europe, while so many other American writers found it to be the place that they could write, I found it to be the place I couldn’t write. I needed to come back and take very seriously what I had to do. So that’s what I did.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>HC:</strong><strong> What did taking it seriously look like?</strong></p>
<p>LT: When I would have an idea to do something, I finished it. I didn’t just start something and let it fizzle away. I sat down, said, “I’m going to write this,” and I did it. The difference between wanting to be a writer and actually writing is a world apart, and the determination to do it, and then executing that, took everything I had in me. Part of me, psychologically, was so terrified, so insecure, and it’s odd, because at the same time I had this other idea that I could be a great writer. Talk about a contradictory psyche! But one of them was stronger than the other, so it won out; the idea that I had to write.</p>
<p><strong>HC:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I thought a male protagonist was an interesting way of exploring how feminism has affected men; how it’s shaped them and how the male role fits around feminism too. There’s a kind of question mark hanging over a lot of Zeke’s identity.</strong></p>
<p>LT: As far as I knew, writers hadn’t really taken up this idea of the effect of the women’s movement on men. And I think it’s been enormous, and in a funny way it may have been more enormous in some ways than on women. The changes that you see, and I’m not saying across the board and that there aren’t some neanderthals walking around, but I was very interested in all my younger male friends, gay and straight, who had very different ideas and were struggling with how to make these changes, and how to deal with their sexuality. And I think that the movement against gender conformity is very, very important, and it comes out of what feminism and the women’s movement set up.</p>
<p><strong>HC: This might seem very specific to you, but it’s interesting to me from a UK perspective as feminism here has seen this very strange turn, with a very small but vocal minority of ‘feminists’ adopting a trans-exclusionary stance. Given that this hasn’t been the case in the US, I wanted to know if you had any thoughts on this, as an American who is engaging with the impact of feminism.</strong></p>
<p>LT: I think it was a friend of mine, Tom Keenan, who is a brilliant theorist, who said that people don’t want to give up. In order for somebody else’s rights to be furthered, in a way you have to give up your own position. And I understand their resistance, because I think they’re hanging on to something; it’s been very painful for many feminists, or for women who call themselves feminists, to be able to speak about their oppression as women. But I don’t agree with this position, because I’m not an essentialist, and I do think that what we call a woman is a constructed thing. People are afraid of change. But I think history is on the side of the trans community, because I think they’re part of a wave coming out of feminism that is challenging the meaning of the body, what the body stands for, and because you’re in this body how it’s supposed to act and what it’s supposed to look like. It’s this great challenge to the idea that the body is the foundation of everything.</p>
<p><strong>HC: </strong><strong>You’re as much a writer of cultural criticism as you are of fiction. In this case, did you feel the novel gave you the freedom to explore certain ideas and concepts that a medium like journalism might not allow for?</strong></p>
<p>LT: I think fiction is as true as any other form of art. I can use characters to be and do and show the consciousness of a period, and have them completely involved in the world outside them, and it affects them of course, both consciously and unconsciously. Writing a character gives me a chance to explore things that I think about, or don’t think about, or think that others think about. I don’t have to agree with everything, I’m creating something other than myself. I think fiction is incredibly important, because without it we can’t think our way through or past a present that may be awful.</p>
<p>The problem with journalism, sometimes, is that it wants to speak about groups of people, and the notion that there are individuals inside, who make up all of these groups, and they have differences from each other, gets lost. I mean I don’t want to speak of the<em> best</em> journalism, but I think that’s a problem in most journalism.</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>An integral part of the downtown New York art scene in the 1980s, American artist <strong><a href="https://www.danielcooneyfineart.com/artists/paul-smith/biography1">Paul Smith</a></strong> got involved with the legendary Lower East Side gallery ABC No Rio in 1983 exhibiting work from the civil war in Guatemala. Primarily a painter making panoramic works, Smith began using a homemade pinhole camera to experiment with perspectives, creating a series of black and white landscapes and sensuous scenes of sexual self-discovery made during the height of the Aids crisis.</p>
<p>In the new exhibition, <a href="https://www.danielcooneyfineart.com/exhibitions/paul-smith"><em>The Human Curve</em></a> opening Saturday, November 14 at Daniel Cooney Fine Art in New York, Smith brings together a selection of these works, some of which were first exhibited in <em>Bodily Fluids</em> at Greathouse Gallery in the East Village in the 1980s.</p>
<p>“It was an exciting time for me,” Smith recalls. “Through <a href="https://www.anothermanmag.com/life-culture/11076/tim-greathouse-1980s-new-york-art-world-daniel-cooney-fine-art-peter-hujar">Tim Greathouse</a> I met David Wojnarowicz, Peter Hujar, Zoe Leonard, and Marcus Leatherdale. I had three solo shows at Greathouse Gallery, but <em>Bodily Fluids</em> was the least commented on show at the time. It wasn’t so common then for people to exhibit sexually intimate and frank work then.”</p>
<p>Here, Smith takes us back to the streets and rooftops of New York for a tender look at beauty, desire, and love.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>“I had mixed feelings about the queer scene. I didn’t grow up around homosexuality and it was in the culture much less in those days. When I first moved to New York, I didn’t identify with the leather bars, the cowboy bars, and the action at the piers. I rode my bicycle on the West Side Highway to work and would often see guys having sex on the highway. John Giorno described it as a golden period for homosexuality in his memoir Great Demon Kings, but I was alienated from it. Through the Pyramid Club and being involved with the Greathouse Gallery, I gradually became more affirmative about homosexuality.</em></p>
<p><em>“When I was making the photographs for Bodily Fluids, I was posing with Marion Scemama, a very adventurous Moroccan-French woman photographer who had helped David Wojnarowicz do his Sex Series. The homosexual scenes in my series were made with a straight friend of mine, Joe, who was unperturbed by intimate poses but uninterested in having any sexual relationship with me. It was more exploratory and confused on my part.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“We were shooting on the rooftop. Even in bright sunlight, my exposures were three minutes long to get good focus with the pinhole camera. The poses were an attempt to get in close. I wanted to depict sex from a participant’s point of view, rather than from a voyeur’s. I would set up a shot but it was pretty improvisatory; I suppose I was just operating out of my libido. A year or two later I posed for David Wojnarowicz. He did some of the photographs of me with the lips sewn shut and another with a bandaged hand holding coins. I was very impressed by how he worked out his sense of subject.</em></p>
<p><em>“The East Village art scene collapsed before the decade was even out and my dealer died of Aids-related causes at the beginning of the 90s. Then David Wojnarowicz died. For a long time I just decided to withdraw. It’s a shock when you suddenly realise it’s been 30 years since this work was seen.”</em></p>

<p><a href="/search?q=luo+yang"><strong>Luo Yang</strong></a> is a rising photography star. Intimate and raw, her work offers a fascinating insight into the lives of China’s young people, sensitively capturing the moments of joy, freedom, and anguish which are so often the markers of our formative years. First exhibited in 2018, her <em>Girls</em> series garnered international acclaim for its portrayal of Chinese women born in the 1980s – featuring a cast of friends and acquaintances, who Yang photographed over the course of a decade, as she grew up alongside them. Now in her thirties, Yang’s ongoing <em>Youth </em>series turns the lens on the next generation of Chinese people: Generation Z.</p>
<p>As an exhibition displaying selected works from both these series continues at <a href="https://www.ooelkg.at/de/ausstellungen-26/themen/detail/youth-girls-luo-yang-selected-works.html">Austria’s Francisco Carolinum Museum</a>, Yang speaks to AnOther about documenting China’s 21st century youth for over ten years. “At first, photography was a way to release my suppressed feelings during adolescence, to record the precious moments of friends around me who share similar emotions,” Yang says of her photography career, which began after borrowing a simple point-and-shoot camera from a friend, when she was still studying.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>From this near-chance beginning, Yang felt compelled to continue documenting the women around her, embarking on a ten-year journey that would result in <em>Girls</em>. Hailing from multiple cities across the country, the women in Yang‘s images break away from traditional ideas of femininity in China, and are captured in all their complexity – in some images they radiate strength, while in others they bravely bear vulnerability. “They’ve formed a precious group image of Chinese women born in the 80s, who are less like the depiction in the mainstream media, but more bold, wild and true to themselves,” says Yang. </p>
<p>A celebration of these women’s individuality, the project is a personal one for the photographer, who sees herself reflected in these shots of her peers. “In them I see the similar emotions and problems that are shared by many my age, me as well,” she says. “I grew up with these girls, and I put part of myself in this series.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Also on show in Austria are images from <em>Youth</em>, Yang’s more personally removed – but no less tenderly approached – ongoing series, which captures the next generation of young people in China who are boldly rejecting societal norms in search of their own identity. “The idea of this series came very naturally when I gradually found that the new generations in China who are born in the 90s and 00s have formed their own culture and identity, which is different from my own,” Yang says of the project, which documents not only girls, but young men, non-binary and transgender individuals. “They are exposed to a more open and international environment, more gender-fluid, more self-centered and dare to speak out their own opinions,” she observes admiringly of Gen Z.</p>
<p>Together, these two series present a compelling document of young people in 21st-century China, recording their determined search for identity and autonomy amid the country’s ever-changing social landscape. Once describing herself as “a recorder of the present, with all its facets,” Yang is documenting this unique and difficult moment in history too, though, as ever, she is approaching this time through a distinctly human lens. “I shoot all the time,” she says. “But my main focus is still people.” </p>

<p>It was 2001, and <strong>Drew Jarrett</strong> was taking his final hit in London’s Heathrow airport. After struggling with drug addiction for nearly nine years, the photographer had finally made a plan: he was going to quit his job, get clean, and make a fresh start in the jungles of Thailand.</p>
<p>Jarrett had spent much of the former decade carousing in the heart of the fashion industry. He had been living in west London with Glen Luchford and Mario Sorrenti, shooting supermodels and colossal creative talents (<a href="/art-photography/gallery/9098/drew-jarrett-1994/10">all captured in his previous book, <em>1994</em></a>). It was an adventure, but one that he soon felt disillusioned by. </p>
<p>“I needed to get clean and wanted to do a project through Asia,” explains the photographer in his latest book, <em>Jungle Dreams</em>. A marked difference from his previous work, the project ended up being focused on a Muay Thai (Thai kickboxing) training gym for young boys in Krabi. Here, Jarratt tells us more about the emotions that lie behind the book, and the lessons he has learned in the years since. </p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>“I first started to take pictures around 1992. They were mainly of my friends, family, and my travels. I wasn’t really doing much fashion – it was more art and reportage. I was all over the world, capturing all sorts of people. I then moved to New York City and started doing a lot of fashion, but by 1998 the magazines were all starting to get more commercial, and I felt like that wasn’t what I signed up for. Also, by then, I was using drugs. So I decided to stop and made my trip to Thailand.</em></p>
<p><em>“This was one of my first real projects, where I immersed myself in just one subject. It was about trying to cover all that was around me. I wanted to capture the boys’ energy not just in the ring, but also outside of it. </em></p>
<p><em>“There are a lot of emotions running through </em>Jungle Dreams<em> – emotions from both me and from the kids. It was a very hard time in my life, and I have always been a person with strong feelings and affection for the people I’m around. Even by the time I met the boys I still wasn’t in great shape, but once I was in the ring with the kids it was like a dream. Their movement, their energy, their grace, and their dedication was just mind-blowing. I immersed myself in them, and the way they took me in was very humbling. I had not been around my own kids enough, and so it brought a lot of things home to me.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“It took me some time after getting back from Thailand to move forward with my life. I eventually started to print images from the trip, and sold a few, and got some great feedback. I then made contact with a few publishers but I guess they didn’t like or get this style of photography. Maybe my name wasn’t a well-known enough, or I wasn’t trendy enough for them.</em></p>
<p><em>“That said, it took 24 years to get my </em>1994<em> book published. It’s all about timing; meeting the right people, and having them appreciate my style. At the end of the day, I do my best to do make timeless images. I keep my integrity, and I stand by not being commercial.</em></p>
<p><em>“In the years since my trip to Thailand, my life has changed so much in so many ways. I am appreciating my children and friends more, making amends to the love ones that I hurt, and I am keeping clean. The person I was then wasn’t so bad, but I also wasn’t as good as I could have been. It wasn’t the way my parents had brought me up. Also, I didn’t like the way I stopped socialising – I just stopped seeing people, and only cared about when and how I was going to get my next hit. It was nasty.</em></p>
<p><em>“2020 has given me the time to find so much from my archives that I never knew was even there. I can appreciate my work more now. Also, because I was stuck at home, I found myself spending more time with my kids, and documenting them. It also gave me the time to work on all of the negatives from </em>Jungle Dreams<em>, which were really scratched up. Once these crazy times come to an end, I hope to uncover more projects like this.”</em></p>

<p><em>Introducing </em><a href="/new-beginnings"><em>New Beginnings</em></a><em>, a new series of mini QAs spotlighting emerging designers, in the wake of </em><a href="/fashion-beauty/12822/cover-story-craig-mcdean-katie-shillingford-emerging-designers-2020"><em>Craig McDean and Katie Shillingford’s shoot</em></a><em> for </em><a href="/tag/another-magazine-autumnwinter-2020"><em>AnOther Magazine Autumn/Winter 2020</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong>AnOther</strong><strong> Magazine: What are your hopes for the future?</strong></p>
<p>Annemarie Saric: I hope the way we adapt to the current issues emphasise empathy and respect for one another. I also hope that out of these uncertain times we will be able to improve and grow.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What is the thinking behind your work?</strong></p>
<p>AS: I researched concept cars and their streamlined shapes. I wanted to translate the stiffness and the shine of cars in my collection. In that sense, I decided to work with stretch and sheeting systems in order to make the garments stiff, which made the body more simplified and enhanced certain parts. I also thought about the concept of a dress or garment, which is almost always a tube. Approaching a garment in that way and seeing it as a geometrical shape, creates a stripped-down version of what a garment is. So I worked in a quite rudimentary way, designing shapes with little or no detail. Besides the tube as a base for my garment, some of my silhouettes are just a simplified version of a rectangular pattern, which becomes a three-dimensional shape through applying incisions.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What three words would you use to describe your approach to fashion?</strong></p>
<p>AS: Specific and general.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What does community mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>AS: Being surrounded by like-minded people that learn, help and challenge each other and treat each other with love and respect.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What community did you grow up around? How did that shape you?</strong></p>
<p>AS: I would consider the friends I went to high school with and the people I met through them, the community that I grew up around. I went to an artistic school which was a really beautiful experience. I feel very lucky to have spent so much time around those people, because I believe that through them I built the base of my approach to fashion. We are all still in touch and it’s fascinating to see how everyone is changing, but still manages to inspire and influence each other.</p>

<p>It’s day one of the second national lockdown and <strong>Lauren Auder</strong> is in her bedroom, at home in London. The sun is shining, and the results of the presidential election are still hanging in the balance. “We are speaking in a liminal space,” I begin our conversation. “Well, it’s a beautiful day for an apocalypse,” Auder replies through a computer screen, before pulling her hood tighter around her face.</p>
<p>Auder, now 21, has been on a long journey with her music. The sonic might not have changed so noticeably – for those who know her, they’ll know she’s a sorceress who commands a deep voice mixed around swirling musical arrangements, what she describes as “orchestral pop.” But the subject matter is shifting for this person who computed the process of transition through her first two EPs.</p>
<p>Two EPs which were about her, and “holding up a mirror to” herself. And while she never sings explicitly about her identity – something which I remark is refreshing when wider culture likes to congratulate itself for going as far as, but rarely further than, ‘representation’ – the first two records are all based in the internal world of Lauren Auder.</p>
<p>But her upcoming EP – <em>5 Songs for the Dysphoric</em>, a name which Auder admits is indeed very “on the nose” – is about other people. Or more specifically, it’s about her interactions with other people, and how being trans affects intimacy with those people. The first single from the record – <em>Animal</em> – is out today.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>Tom Rasmussen: I’ve been listening to you loads and been thinking about this amazing ability you have to make your listener feel held. Is that your intention?</strong></p>
<p>Lauren Auder: Definitely. 100 per cent. I couldn’t put it better myself. My intention to make music that makes people feel held and makes people feel like there’s a place [for them]. I think for people like me growing up outside of the normal, music was a place of solace. I guess that’s the same thing that I want to translate. I always come into music as a fan. So there’s always a big question: what would I want from a musician? I think that a big part for me is to [make] the music that I needed when I was growing up.</p>
<p><strong>TR: I always think it’s so ironic, isn’t it? Writing anything from the margins is often self-authored. But actually, the intention is quite selfless; it’s often to use yourself as a conduit for other people’s experiences and emotions. Would you agree?</strong></p>
<p>LA: Yeah. I mean I’m sure there’s a fair amount of ego involved in anyone deciding to write. But I think a big part of it is delving in with the intent that it will be useful outwardly. I think all my favourite musicians are people who are very personal. The act of opening up is always something that feels comforting, even if it’s in a conversation with a friend, it’s the way you create true ties to people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My intention to make music that makes people feel held and makes people feel like there’s a place [for them]” – Lauren Auder</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TR: Do you think that’s where the ability to write about such a specific experience and actually make it translatable to a wider audience comes from? When you approach a song, do you think about an overarching emotion or a really specific story?</strong></p>
<p>LA: I think it’s the more specific experience that I write about. I find this the most effective, affecting. It’s definitely become a more specific process, because there’s a trust between myself and the people who I hope will listen to me. And also there’s a certain emotional intelligence that is innate to human beings. We can take other’s lived experiences and, if we have the will, we can always understand that, and relate that to our own lives.</p>
<p><strong>TR: Yeah, because I also think a lot of contemporary music can quite easily patronise a listener. Hmm … maybe that’s too savage?</strong></p>
<p>LA: I have many hot takes. I think especially when it comes to music that is dedicated to a more youthful audience, like teenagers. I guess in my heart, that’s who I would want to touch most because, as I said, that’s when I found the artists that were really important to me and really helped me. I think for a younger age group [music] can be very patronising or belittling to the grandeur of the emotions that you go through at that period of time. When really that’s maybe when emotions feel the grandest.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="AIiJpa8Cz_I"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIiJpa8Cz_I" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>TR: That’s what your second EP, </strong><strong><em>two caves in</em></strong><strong>, was about right? This grand journey of teenage emotion? But, and perhaps because as a trans queer person myself I’m destined to go through a delayed adolescence, that EP really touched me, too.</strong></p>
<p>LA: When you spend quite a lot of time not being able to fully realise yourself, in a public sense, or in your own life, then you have you go through those transitional phases quite a bit later. I think that was definitely the case for me. A lot of my own development and my personality was very hard to define when you’re living with a mask. I think that only really started to come off in the past two years.</p>
<p><strong>TR: It’s interesting, the idea of the ever-changing nature of an artist. Because when we think of the pressure on female artists to reinvent constantly, it’s sort of more refreshing, or maybe just more realistic, to instead see that process as one of like constant evolution.</strong></p>
<p>LA: I think reinvention implies that there’s something manufactured about it. But there’s definitely a constant conscious effort in my work to change along the way. I think I arrived at the pinnacle of what I was attempting to do for the past three EPs, at the end of the last one: which was to make some orchestral pop music. Hopefully I will be able to surpass what I’ve done there, because I felt like I arrived at a point where I’d done what I wanted to do with that sound. So a reinvention here might just mean a big change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What I’m trying to talk about on the songs is the collateral damage of issues like dysphoria, rather than dysphoria explicitly” – Lauren Auder</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TR: And now you’re nearing your next release, </strong><strong><em>5 Songs for the Dysphoric</em></strong><strong>. What’s different about this upcoming release?</strong></p>
<p>LA: I think letting external influences in. I wanted to explore different sounds and do different things. And I guess that in some ways it could be some sort of reinvention. I think there’s a lot more electronic music on the new record, and there’s a lot more focus on shorter and more concise songs. But it’s not so much a reinvention, it’s just like the natural shift in the way I want to express myself. I have a real desire right now to be more direct. I guess that’s even supposed to come through in the record title, which is really on the nose.</p>
<p><strong>TR: Even though the last two EPs have been about yourself, as a trans person it’s refreshing for me to hear someone explore transition and not have to talk explicitly about them. It sort of feels beyond representation and into the nuances of the experience of being trans.</strong></p>
<p>LA: What I’m trying to talk about on the songs is the collateral damage of issues like dysphoria, rather than dysphoria explicitly. Or like the collateral damage of the trans experience. It’s not so much about the spirit specifically, but like, how that relates to your relationships and to the way you express yourself. It’s much more about how it affects the way I really relate to people, rather than it just being like an internal crisis. And that’s more what I was trying to write about, I guess, rather than my internal experience.</p>

<p>For the last five years, <strong>Lola Paprocka</strong> and <strong>Pani Paul</strong> have been going back to basics. The photography duo – who are known primarily for their relaxed, sun-soaked portraits – are taking a more traditional route in their latest project, swapping the great outdoors for the stark, stripped back interior of their east London studio.</p>
<p>Their new book, <a href="https://palmstudios.co.uk/product/studio-portraits-2015-2020/"><em>Lola  Pani Studio Portraits 2015-2020</em></a>, sees the pair capture a selection of bright young creatives from across the art, fashion and music worlds. Some are friends, others are friends of friends, but all of them are striking in their individuality. The only unifying quality to all the shots is their location: an unadorned space with a clean, grey backdrop.</p>
<p>Here, Lola  Pani tell us more about this new direction; from the impetus behind it, to the subjects they are most drawn to.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>“Our goal for this project was to remove any context of an exterior environment. We wanted to create a space where the image becomes solely about the person in front of the camera. It creates a kind of one-on-one atmosphere, where we can connect with the subject on a more personal level, with fewer distractions. We like the pared-back honesty that portraits have when made in this traditional way. </em></p>
<p><em>“When we’re looking for subjects, we’re attracted to people we feel we can relate to in one way or another. It’s hard to pinpoint, but it’s very instinctual – we also like someone who doesn’t blink a lot. [Laughs.] We just hope that they feel comfortable and leave with a feeling of self-confidence; like someone took the time to appreciate them for who they are.</em></p>
<p><em>“As photographers, our styles compliment each other. Pani (who is originally from Byron Bay in Australia) assisted for many years and went the pretty traditional route, whereas Lola (who is originally from Poland) had a more DIY approach. She’d only worked on personal projects, organising grassroots exhibitions and making zines. We shared very similar aesthetics from the start, though, and over the years have learned so much from each other that we almost share one brain at this point (with four arms).</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“We created this photo book as a ‘historical document’. Packing them into a physical object helps bring the photos to life. The shape, texture, and even smell have something special about them, and you also learn a lot about your own work in the process. We are constantly encouraged to consume as much content as possible via our devices and social media. Photo books just are a nice excuse not to do that.</em></p>
<p><em>“2020 has certainly been a full-on year, but the first lockdown acted like a bit of mental holiday from ‘freelance constant productivity’. I think freelancers live with a subtle guilt trip that you could always be doing more, but when everything shuts down and there is nothing that can be done you learn to deal with this newfound, seemingly awkward stillness. With that constant productivity mentality, you can lose sight or neglect other important things in your life, connection, community, and friends. So in hindsight, having a break like that was important: it allowed breathing room for a bunch of projects we’d had on the back burner, and we could use that renewed energy to complete this book.”</em></p>

    <category term="Fashion  Beauty" />
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[






<p><strong>Martine Rose</strong> is contradictorily interested in communities and the individual. She’s both an outsider and an insider, a loner and happy to be part of a group. But maybe that’s part of the industry, too, which is built on freaks and geeks. It’s usually the unfashionable ones from school who somehow make it in fashion. “Fashion is about outsiders, and I’ve always been attracted to outsiders, alternative people,” Rose says. “It’s definitely where all the freaks end up. But then, within that, it creates its own sort of conformity.” Her menswear label, which she has been designing under her own name since 2007, bears out the former while challenging the latter. Her clothes have an appeal often touted as cultish, which is sometimes synonymous with difficult: she proposes new proportions, different fabrics, twists and turns around silhouettes. Not everyone can wear it. “I don’t get offended if it’s not everyone’s thing at all,” she says. “It’s really not supposed to be.” Rose is gregarious, friendly, warm – she doesn’t strike you as a designer trying to be tricky. Nevertheless, she is one who resolutely refuses to play by anyone’s rules. “I think I’m, for lack of a better word, rebellious by nature,” Rose says. “Since I was really small, I’ve never really liked the idea of mass anything. If I felt that lots of people were doing one thing, I would absolutely go the other way.”</p>
<p>And so, Rose has. Now 40, she has spent much of her career bucking expectations – with varying degrees of success, at least in the material sense. Her label rose and fell, was picked up by retailers and dropped. She skipped a bunch of seasons – only finding financial stability to accompany general critical acclaim in the half decade since 2015. It is very much an old-school fashion story – especially in London fashion – one that many designers today circumvent by compromising, cutting corners and, arguably, selling out. Rose isn’t into that. “I went to see an Ibsen play when I was about 17, An Enemy of the People,” she says. “It’s basically about the danger of mass – of the mindless mob. That there is no thought and there’s something inherently dangerous about mob mentality – and it really struck a chord with me. I’d always felt like that.”</p>
<p>A simplistic reflection is Rose’s reticence to join the cacophony of seasonal catwalk shows. For Spring/Summer 2015, instead of showing a full collection she presented a single look – a concise and precise statement of what she had to say. Other times she oscillates between still images and runway shows, finding power in the quiet contemplation of the former and the dynamic energy of the latter. Recently, when showing on catwalks, Rose has chosen unconventional settings. Hers have snaked through the stalls of a covered market in Tottenham, close to her studio, as well as around an indoor climbing centre just around the corner, and down St Leonard’s Square, a cul-de-sac in Chalk Farm, north London. “That wasn’t my road,” Rose says, correcting assumptions made. “It’s not like I hung out or grew up there or anything like that. It just had a community spirit that I found compelling.” Her Autumn/Winter 2020 show was staged in the primary school that her daughter Valentine, now five, attends. “It’s where I go every day to pick her up,” Rose says, simply. It came across as heartfelt, real, intimate and intensely personal – as do her clothes.</p>
<p>The idea of communities was what initially drew Rose into fashion. “I wasn’t one of those kids who was making stuff,” Rose says. “But as an outsider, fashion was where I felt most aligned with people. That and music. I always saw fashion as part of culture. Less high-end catwalk stuff, which wasn’t on my radar at all, but much more the clothes that I saw my sister wearing, which was Pam Hogg, Christopher Nemeth, Junior Gaultier, Helen Storey.” Rose’s sister, Michelle, is 15 years her senior – glamorous, <em>Vogue</em>-reading. Her mother Sonia was a nurse and her father Clifford, a one-time Black Panther, was an accountant. “My sister was my everything,” says Rose, who would crouch on her bed, watching her get ready for nights out. Michelle inspired her younger sibling to study fashion at Middlesex University; in 2002, Rose began a label, LMNOP, with a friend, Tamara Rothstein, now the stylist who works on her shows. “I was the youngest in my extended family of cousins, and I just used to watch them all get ready to go out,” Rose says. “I loved the tribalism of it. It was like this access that I had to this other world. And I just could not wait to get there.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Rose’s work has focused not on the cult of a designer’s personality, but rather the personalities of cults around her: music subcultures, rave and skaters, of belonging, somewhere and somehow, to a group. She has offered her own takes on football kits – bicoloured, her name taking the place of the team’s or maybe even a sponsor’s logo, made of the same kind of slithery polyester jacquard as an Arsenal or Chelsea kit. Rose’s subversion of branding is, in a sense, about communities, too: do you wear Adidas, do you wear Nike? That says something about you, your social aspirations, your place in life.</p>
<p>Even ideas of corporate identity and religion have been rolled in – the latter, maybe most unconventionally of all. In 2015, Rose started working alongside Demna Gvasalia as a consultant for the menswear line of Balenciaga. For the house’s debut men’s show in June 2016, Gvasalia and Rose wanted to include authentic liturgical damasks and laces – real, just like those football kits. They were purchased from a supplier to the Holy See, sourced in Paris. Rose went to buy the fabrics herself. “It was quite intense,” she says. “And I had this jacket on that was so inappropriate. I bought a Lewis Leathers jacket from Camden Market, which had ‘Wankers’ written in Tipp-Ex on the back. I really didn’t know what to expect – but I didn’t expect actual fucking nuns to be working there. French or no French, I mean, it didn’t feel appropriate. So I took off my jacket and did this whole acting bit – ‘Oh yes, I’m just interested in some lace.’ Thank God for the language barrier. They couldn’t quite understand me, so I was sort of creeping around, vaguely pretending.” She buries her head in her hands at the memory, but she’s laughing. “It was just awful.”</p>
<p>That isn’t indicative of her time working at the house – a three-year period that amicably ended in 2018. The unconventional appointment began when Rose – heavily pregnant with her daughter – received a call from Gvasalia, Balenciaga’s then recently appointed creative director. He asked if Rose would consider consulting for Balenciaga. “It was a really fucking expensive hobby until I was 34,” says Rose, of fashion. “I was still working in bars, I was squatting. It didn’t become a feasible career until really far down the line, basically until Demna was like, ‘I like what you do. Do you want to come and do it here?’” Rose had never worked for another fashion brand. But she said yes – and, in doing so, an underground underdog went overground. If not mass, her Balenciaga gig was certainly evidence that her aesthetic has mass appeal. And not just within the cliquey, extreme cloisters of the fashion industry: guys in pubs and clubs wound up wearing Balenciaga’s logoed pieces, not least a hypebeast-friendly rework of the Bernie Sanders logo, originally shown in the label’s corporate-inspired Autumn/Winter 2017 menswear show. Ironically, Rose’s Balenciaga rip-off is now ripped off, in turn. It’s a twist I suspect she likes. Logo jacking is an idea Rose explores often, reworking other people’s identities, subverting their codes. Durex condoms, Bose, MTV. They’re reminiscent of the bootlegs common in rave and acid-house wear. But she also reworks the identities of the clothes she designs, hiking up waistbands, widening legs, mutating trainers. Nothing is what it may first appear.</p>
<p>Having worked at a storied, heavily archived house such as Balenciaga – and, arguably, having shifted the aesthetic of menswear over the past decade or so – was she conscious of making pieces that are going down in history, I ask. It sounds pretentious, but Rose doesn’t wrinkle her nose. “I don’t think about it as pretentious,” she says, carefully. “One of my favourite objects is a smiley acid-house T-shirt. It’s so thin, it’s so transparent, it’s like silk. It was from my cousin, he was really into acid house. I’ve had it since 1989. My mum banned me from wearing it – and I can’t wear it now, because it’s so transparent. But it’s so precious now. It’s been washed a billion times, and it’s become this beautiful, fragile thing. It represents, still, this moment in time that was important to me.” She pauses. “To think that anyone would hold onto something that I’ve made for 20 years and feel like it brings something to them, even if they don’t wear it ... I love that.”</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>This afternoon Istanbul-born, London-based designer <a href="/tag/dilara-findikoglu"><strong>Dilara Findikoglu</strong></a> – who we have previously given the epithet of “the sorceress of British design” on account of her otherworldly outfits – premieres a new short film capturing her <a href="/tag/autumnwinter-2020">Autumn/Winter 2020</a> collection, exclusively on AnOthermag.com.</p>
<p>Directed by Olgaç Bozalp and styled by AnOther Magazine’s fashion director (menswear) Ellie Grace Cumming, <em>Unite  Rise  Pray for the Mother</em> imagines a world in which the ‘Dilara Findikoglu women’ had invaded the historical region of Mesopotamia. Shot in Turkey and featuring local models, it tells the ancient story of Shahmaran, a mythical creature, half-woman and half-snake who is found in the folklore of Iran, Anatolia, Iraq, and of the Kurds.</p>
<p>“The legend of Shahmaran incorporates important images and symbols regarding the status of women in society,” Findkoglu tells AnOther. “Shahmaran, who has similar traits to other Anatolian female deities, has come to be known as a sage, a healer and as a symbol of fertility and goodwill. Although she was killed by her lover. There is a strong connection between her story and the stories of other women who were killed by men. In our project, Shahmaran is being awakened to help us bring back the matriarchal energy.”</p>
<p>While <em>Unite  Rise  Pray for the Mother</em> is brimming with mythology and poetry, like much of Findikoglu’s work, it also speaks to reality, specifically issues of gender inequality and the lived experience of women around the world. The film is a response to femicide in Turkey, an issue that Findikoglu was aware of but confronted with when she returned to the country earlier this year, following the national lockdown here in the UK.</p>
<p>“As a designer, I always wanted to make a positive impact on the issues in the world through my designs,” she says. “I feel like I’m a storyteller and with this project, I wanted to tell the story of the victims of these awful incidents and raise awareness on this issue.”</p>
<p>“We launched a social media campaign recently to raise awareness of these femicides, we found out that, 440 women in 2018, 474 women in 2019 and 369 women until September were murdered by men in Turkey and after seeing these statistics it was impossible to remain silent,” she continues. “I want to keep using my voice and do anything I can for change.”</p>
<p>As such, the film is a testament to not only Findikoglu’s skill as a designer but her ability to tell stories and weave social and political issues thoughtfully into her clothes.</p>

<p>From the colourful temples of India to the art nouveau grandeur of Romania, <a href="/tag/wes-anderson">Wes Anderson</a> can draw out the magic of any location. The director’s films – which are shot in all corners of the world – are more like enchanting travel guides, elevating everyday scenes into vivid, pastel-hued dreamscapes.</p>
<p>It is this quality that first attracted Wally Koval to Anderson’s work. Entranced by the director’s lavish locations, he decided to pay tribute by starting an Instagram account – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/accidentallywesanderson/?hl=en">@AccidentallyWesAnderson</a> – dedicated to recreating the same aesthetics. “It began as a travel bucket list for me and my wife Amanda,” says Koval, a Brooklyn-based content marketer.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><a href="/design-living/10460/the-instagram-feed-showcasing-places-worthy-of-wes-anderson">Launched in 2017</a>, @AccidentallyWesAnderson collects images from all over the world, taken by an array of different photographers (anyone can submit an image they feel matches the Anderson aesthetic). Each picture that is shared on the account comes with a brief history of the location it features, in keeping with Koval’s original ‘travel bucket list’ theme. </p>
<p>To say it’s taken off would be an understatement: In the three years since it began, @AccidentallyWesAnderson has become a social media sensation, gaining over a million followers and spawning – as of last month – an accompanying photo book. The eponymous latter contains 200 of the best shots, whittled down from over 15,000 global submissions.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>So what makes an image worthy of the cut? Well, as Koval notes, Anderson’s films are known for their immaculate framing, symmetry and colour coordination - but there’s also substance behind the style.  </p>
<p>“A place that is Accidentally Wes Anderson is multifaceted,” says Koval. “Physically, it exudes some of the staple characteristics of symmetry or colour palette, but it also holds an interesting story – something unexpected or just plain intriguing behind its facade.”</p>
<p>The <em>Accidentally Wes Anderson</em> book contains some of the best examples of this. The featured photos, taken in every continent, reveal some of the most interesting and idiosyncratic locations on earth. There are dramatic old Italian palaces, towering Japanese rollercoasters, and mysterious, windswept wharves in New Zealand. And like the Instagram account, it’s not just about visuals: each location comes with an unexpected historical narrative, to offer some additional insight.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>The project is a worldwide collaboration, with many different photographers, writers and designers taking part. “The community as a whole deserved for these works to be put together into a printed collection that embodied what it had become,” Koval says. And even Anderson himself approves, with the director providing a foreword for the final copy. In it, he calls the book both “alluring” and “entertaining”. (“I think I smiled for a few hours straight after I received that news,” says Koval). </p>
<p>Ultimately, Koval hopes that <em>Accidentally Wes Anderson</em> will act as an “inspiration for your next travel adventure, but at its core, provide a moment of delight every time you flip through the pages.”</p>
<p>“My hope is that the book will be a bit of a respite for whoever picks it up,” he says, finally. “Some may utilise it to find their next adventure, others – I have been told – may utilise it as a mood board for their next interior design project, but all in all, I just hope it provides a breath of fresh air and a smile to whoever picks it up.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.kerberverlag.com/en/1860/jackie-nickerson"><em><strong>Field Test </strong></em><strong>by Jackie Nickerson, published by Kerber</strong></a></p>
<p>Jackie Nickerson is a master of shape, form and texture, creating perfectly sculpted photographs that are both powerful and profound. In her latest book, <em>Field Test</em>, the American-born artist goes even deeper, exploring the psychological effects of globalisation, fake news, environmental pollution and migration. “It’s about the collective trauma of modern living,” she <a href="/art-photography/12918/field-test-jackie-nickerson-book-2020-interview">told AnOther</a> at the end of last month. “It’s about the mundane things and hidden forces in your life, which you don’t have any knowledge of control over.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Sunil Gupta’s striking, monochrome portraits of gay couples in 1980s London are a time capsule. Taken at the height of the Aids crisis, they offer a rebuttal to the fearmongering press portrayals of the time. Instead, they celebrate an LGBT community, who – although relentlessly demonised in the media – were unafraid to be out, proud, and positive about their future.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Scottish choreographer Michael Clark is a cross-cultural dance pioneer. In the 1980s, he melded the disparate worlds of classical ballet and punk, creating an exciting new landscape in the British arts. During the course of his career, he has worked with artists and musicians as diverse as Sarah Lucas, The Fall, Leigh Bowery and Peter Doig – a testament to his fluid and trailblazing talent.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

Love, Sex, and Desire. Drawings 1950–1962</em> by Michael Dayton Hermann, Drew Zeiba and Blake Gopnik, published by Taschen</strong></a></p>
<p>In the summer of 1952, a then-unknown Andy Warhol attempted to exhibit his defiant sketches of queer intimacy. The ink drawings – which were rejected by the New York art scene at the time – were a celebration of youth, beauty and carnal pleasure. Although they were eventually overshadowed by the artist’s later work, 300 of them have been uncovered in the new book, <em>Andy Warhol. Love, Sex, and Desire. Drawings 1950–1962.</em></p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>British artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye conjures dark, mesmerising oil paintings of imagined Black subjects. The portraits, which are pulled entirely from her mind, are both contemporary and classical: fusing older European aesthetics with modern, everyday embellishments.<em> Fly In League With The Night</em> is the first major survey of the artist’s work, and contains nearly 80 lavish paintings and drawings – some never seen before.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Mark McKnight’s stark, sensual new book, <em>Heaven Is A Prison </em>(Loose Joints), captures an unfolding love story in the Southern Californian desert. The photographer trains his lens on two men as they surrender to desire, becoming physically entangled in a vast and otherworldly landscape. “It’s about desire, and those things which we beg from others in our intimacies,” he told <a href="/art-photography/12791/heaven-is-a-prison-by-mark-mcknight-new-book-loose-joints-interview-california">AnOther earlier this year</a>. “It’s as much a self-abasement as it is a christening.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“Like much of my work, this book is suitable for no one lol,” joked <a href="/art-photography/12856/bruce-labruce-in-conversation-with-slava-mogutin-death-book-2020">Bruce LaBruce last month</a>. The artist was talking about his characteristically out-there new publication, <em>Death Book</em>, which is oozing with images of blood, gore and brutality. It is exactly what you’d expect from the legendary provocateur: a post-apocalyptic vision of the modern world, which also doubles as a critique of Western culture’s fear of mortality.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Hervé Guibert was a true polymath, and worked as a writer, actor, director and photographer during the 1980s. His sombre, meditative art flirts with the darker drives of human nature, including sex, death, depression and violence. Although mostly forgotten by much of the mainstream art world, this new book (and <a href="/art-photography/12921/herve-guibert-lovers-time-death-exhibition-book-photography">accompanying show</a>) gives his work a new lease of life.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>It’s not an overstatement to say that <strong>Futura</strong> is a titan of contemporary art. Born and raised in New York City, Futura (real name: Leonard Hilton McGurr) honed his craft – which can best be described as an abstract graphic style of painting – adorning subways in the late 1970s. Among the very first graffiti artists to exhibited in contemporary galleries, his paintings were hung alongside works by the likes of Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat, among others. Fast forward a few decades, Futura has undertaken commissions from brands including A Bathing Ape, Stüssy and Supreme, in addition to Nike, Undercover and Virgil Abloh. </em></p>
<p><em>A new monograph published by <a href="https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847866021">Rizzoli</a> brings together works from throughout Futura’s 40-year-long career, spanning</em><em> paintings (some of which have never been published), drawings, photography and ephemera, which pay testament to his intimate relationship to – and immeasurable impact on – the art and wider culture of the street. Here, in an exclusive excerpt from this book, fellow artist Takashi Murakami opens up about his relationship to this artistic legend.</em></p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Since <strong>Futura</strong> had been a Ura-Harajuku fashion icon in Japan, especially in his association with NIGO, I thought he was someone in the fashion industry until just five or so years ago. Even now, of course, he has simultaneous collaboration projects with a number of fashion brands, including Off-White and Comme des Garçons.</p>
<p>Yet in fact he originated as a first-generation graffiti artist. I was not at all aware of the staggering fact that he was a genuine artist, who had debuted around the same time as Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. When the boom for Neo-Expressionism wound down, he temporarily withdrew from the art scene to raise his children. After a hiatus of about 20 or 30 years, he re-emerged as a multi-faceted talent, being tremendously active seemingly everywhere for the past ten years.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>I have become very close with Futura 2000 – or Lenny, his real name – in the past year and a half or so. I approached him with a proposal to present his work in my gallery in Japan, and though we have both been too busy so far actually to realise his solo exhibition as of yet, we have been exchanging our various thoughts and opinions all this time, together with his manager, Sky Gellatly.</p>
<p>At the moment we are discussing my gallery’s potential role in Asia supporting his projects and productions, as well as sales of his works, but we still don’t know where things will go from here. Regardless, I am blown away every single day by Futura’s creative energy, which apparently only grows contrary to his age and seems single-mindedly to set its sights on the future.

<p><strong><a href="http://www.anothermag.com/tag/gucci">Gucci</a></strong>’s upcoming collection, <em>OUVERTURE of Something that Never Ended</em>, is set to be unveiled later this month. However, in an innovative new twist, creative director Alessandro Michele has announced his plans to present it through an eponymous seven-part mini-series.</p>
<p>The short films will be co-directed by Gus Van Sant, the cult visionary behind <em>Drugstore Cowboy</em> and <em>My Own Private Idaho</em>. They will each centre around the actress Silvia Calderoni as she goes about her “daily routine” in Rome, encountering a dazzling array of international talents. This includes Harry Styles, Arlo Parks, Florence Welch and Billie Eilish, among others.</p>
<p>Michele will be directing the genre-blending series with Van Sant, and will be premiering it during “GucciFest” – a wider digital festival which celebrates the works of 15 independent young designers, including <a href="/tag/ahluwalia">Ahluwalia</a>, Stefan Cooke, <a href="/tag/mowalola">Mowalola</a> and <a href="/tag/bianca-saunders">Bianca Saunders</a>. These emerging talents were all selected by Michele earlier this year, and will be revealing their work through an accompanying series of fashion films.</p>
<p>GucciFest will run between 16-22 November, with an episode of <em>OUVERTURE of Something that Never Ended </em>being uncovered each day. The full festival will be broadcast on YouTube, as well as on its own dedicated site <a href="http://Guccifest.com">GucciFest.com</a>.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>The origins of preppy style can be traced back to the early 20th century, at the Ivy League colleges of New England – and without even having to think much about it, once the word ‘preppy’ comes to mind, images of pastel cable knit sweaters, deck shoes, chinos, and attire for boating, tennis and rugby, immediately spring into view. In the 1950s, preppy hit its peak, before taking on a life of its own in the 1980s, finding a place in popular culture outside of the walls of Harvard and Yale. From the Hollywood Brat Pack to Princess Diana, preppy was ‘in vogue’ as much as it was a marker of social status. And, as Lisa Birnbach wrote in her satirical guide <em>The Official Preppy Handbook, </em>published at the turn of that decade<em>: </em>“For the first time [preppy dressers] are in a community of many different types of people, and this very functional uniform helps them to identify one another in a crowd.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Of course, there are the labels synonymous with preppy both past and present: Ralph Lauren, J.Crew, Tommy Hilfiger, to name but three. American-Swedish heritage brand <strong>Gant</strong>, is also inextricably linked with the preppy look, and is now tackling what exactly that means for 2020 and beyond. First and foremost, for the brand’s creative director Christopher Bastin, preppy is an attitude – not just about the clothing itself. “Preppy has always evolved and taken influences from the zeitgeist of the world around it,” he tells AnOther. “Preppy used to be a pair of chinos, penny loafers, a brightly coloured polo and a club blazer, but today it’s much more than that. Now we’re seeing streetwear influencing silhouettes and fabrics, and finding its way into preppy style.<em>” </em>Bastin cites brands such as Rowing Blazers, Kith and Noah who have done this to great success, imbuing preppy codes with fresh meaning and relevance.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>One of its latest projects redefining preppy today, is <a href="https://www.gant.co.uk/luke-edward-hall-for-gant">a capsule collection created with London-based artist Luke Edward Hall</a>, who has established himself as a bastion of eclectic taste in recent years. His eye for colour, kitsch and whimsy draws inspiration from the likes of Diana Vreeland, Fornasetti, Cecil Beaton and the Bloomsbury Set. “We reached out to Luke in January this year with the idea of a collaboration,” explains Gant’s creative director Christopher Bastin. “When doing some research, I noticed that he used to wear Gant Rugger back in the day, and since he has a very preppy approach to the way he dresses, we had high hopes he would like the idea. We turned out to be right, thankfully.” After these initial conversations, Hall flew out to the brand’s headquarters in Stockholm, where he got straight to rooting through the label’s extensive archive, exploring the vintage pieces and collectables stored there.</p>
<p>The artist then took his research back to the UK, and began sketching out designs in his signature illustrative style that would form the basis of the Luke Edward Hall for Gant collection. “I knew he was extremely talented, but it still blew me away,” says Bastin. “It was a great process and I wish it was always this simple and joyful to design a collection!” The concept for the capsule range was to create a very British take on preppy American sportswear, “all of it infused with Luke’s acquired taste,” says Bastin. From printed bow tie blouses and chunky knitted sweatshirts, to recreations of Gant’s 1950s button-down shirts in a pinpoint Oxford stripe – plus slouchy coats in tweeds and corduroys, delicate silk dresses, and long-sleeved rugby shirts – the collection infuses Ivy League with a sideways glance at streetwear codes. “The collection is very heritage driven, but also modern in its touch and wear,” continues the brand’s creative director. “The knits are all premium fabrics such as cashmere, yak and virgin wool. All the wovens are uniquely designed for the collection by various italian mills such as Albizzate and Manteco.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>But how is Gant intending to keep pushing preppy forward? Bastin has some big ideas, and is confident in the way the label can take ownership of the style. “A lot of legacy brands fall in the trap of becoming stale and a victim of huge numbers, preventing them to be bold and move forward,” he explains. “As long as we don’t take ourselves too seriously and continue to evolve the preppy mindset, then I really think Gant is the future of American sportswear.”</p>

<p>“The collection is about that sophomoric story of Noah’s ark, of animals coming in two by two. There is something charming about the easy story of it, the innocence of animals. Personally, I love animals. There’s something really pure about having animals around. For me, then there’s the idea of the embroideries, the preppy idea of embroidering animals on pieces of clothing.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“A collection always starts from proportion – by thinking about how I can play with proportions in a different way, in a way that will make the collection evolve. Of course, there are references to movies and to art, but sometimes, just closing my eyes and trying to think of something interesting to me is where it comes from. I love the idea of pushing strong feminine ideas into the men’s collection and strong masculine ideas into the women’s collection. Especially in the times we’re living, men and women are so much more open to different types of ideas, and it not being so clearly masculine or feminine. The most interesting idea with this collection was the notion of the looks being pushed to a point where you really didn’t know who was the guy and who was the girl. Which also links to that story of Noah’s ark, in a way.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“My parents, both being professionals, worked, so I grew up around tailoring. So much of what I do is connected to the classic idea of tailoring, but it’s a total rebellion against any type of rule. If you were to talk to real, traditional tailors, they would probably laugh at what I do. I have such an appreciation for the quality of hand-tailoring but, for me, there needed to be a new conversation with regard to how people perceived it. And I would never limit myself by saying that I wouldn’t do something.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“I love when people have different interpretations of what I do, but sometimes my ideas aren’t as intellectually thought-out as some people think. I love taking really simple ideas and putting them in front of people – but then, them being interpreted in a deeper way is interesting to me, too. If you’re going to ask me where it’s coming from, it might be Bugs Bunny as opposed to Rothko. I love approaching my collections in an almost childlike way. I think there are a lot of American references that I play with in most of my collections, an American sensibility. That is something I want people to feel.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“I guess I get bored, so sometimes I just want to entertain myself. I think it’s fun to surround the collections with a story. There’s definitely an interest in making sure there’s something entertaining, a little bit of escape and fantasy, especially now. It’s the most important time to be fantastic and show beautiful things and to inspire, to create things that take people out of their realities. I think creativity is always the most important thing to celebrate in times like these.”</p>

<p>Last month, we invited emerging designers from around the world to submit their work for a chance to win a portfolio review session with the AnOther Magazine team. We were blown away by the response. Over 450 of you got in touch and we were astounded by the quality – and creativity – of your work.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we had the tricky task of whittling the submissions down to just eight winners, who present their collections here, sharing a few words on the concept behind their designs. They range from twin brothers Paulo and Roberto Ruiz Muñoz, whose brand DNI pays thoughtful homage to their home country of Peru, to French former styling assistant Lauren Perrin, who creates clever hand-crafted tights, gloves and sleeves.</p>
<p>Speaking to these individuals, we were inspired not only by their creativity and their craft, but their commitment to environmental practices. We felt hopeful that, though we are experiencing dark times right now, the future of fashion is bright with minds such as these lighting the way. Thank you again to all who applied and explore the winners’ collections below.</p><h2><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dni_official/?hl=en">DNI</a> (Paulo and Roberto Ruiz Muñoz)</h2>
<p>28, Peru</p>
<p>“We called this collection ‘Volver’ (to return) because we went back to what seemed essential, not to continue creating a new collection, but to bring together the most representative pieces of our two first collections in a proposal photographed in Peru. ‘Volver’ brings to life what Peru represents in our memories, especially through various important elements such as the emblematic motorcycle taxis, the beach, the sea and the fishing boats – symbols that keep inspiring us today, reminding us of our childhood in our hometown of Casagrande-Trujillo. For us, having this collection photographed in Peru when we were confined to Paris was like coming home, especially with Peruvian talents, it was even more rewarding.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<h2><a href="https://laurenperrin.com/">Lauren Perrin</a></h2>
<p>24, France</p>
<p>“After working as a stylist assistant for three years, I wanted to reconnect with designing and making clothes – the reason I first became interested in fashion. The decision to concentrate specifically on tights arose from what I saw as a gap in the market for bespoke, hand-crafted tights, which I later added to with gloves and sleeves. Working mainly with vintage fabrics and antique buttons for editorial commissions, I wanted each of my designs to feel unique. For commercial pieces, I work a lot with lycra, a strong and versatile fabric that reminds me of my hometown of Biarritz where people wear it to surf. Now I am focused on outsourcing the manufacturing of my products, meaning they will become more affordable to a wider audience, a hugely important step for me.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>23, Switzerland</p>
<p>“My collection was a development from my thesis research into Donna Haraway’s <em>Cyborg Manifesto</em> and Alfie Bown’s <em>Playstation Dreamworld</em>, exploring human relationships with technology and attempting to subvert patriarchal science fiction archetypes. I worked in ZBrush to create print and jewellery elements referencing the <em>Dark Souls</em> game franchise, which alongside the silicone moulding process became a means of investigating the definition of craft in a digital age. Haraway’s definition of the cyborg as a ‘disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self’ informed the posture corrector and waist trainer garment references, in reaction to my relationship with my phone and the performance we all participate in as online avatars.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“The process of creating the collections is a way of understanding myself and the women of this generation. The collection ‘No Man’ is a story about a woman who is living without a man. Her feelings and her state of mind were investigated and transformed into the garments. The inspiration was driven by artworks of contemporary artists such as Polly Borland, Eva Hesse and Sarah Lucas. The feminism theme was exploring within the collection – I reused and remade such feminine items as tights, bras, and panties for making some of the garments of the collection. The shapes, silhouettes, details, and the way of construction of the garments are the way of telling this story.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“An intrinsic part of my identity developed thanks to my diverse heritage, one that involved migration and cultural fuses throughout generations. The cross-cultural way of life is normal for me, and one that I envision for the world. Through my practice I aim for a trans-national way of life by disarming prejudice. I repurpose and decommission military surplus garments to break down the borders, violence, repression and nationalism that they represent. The outcome subverts the viewer by referencing military garments for an opposite and new purpose. It eliminates their negative connotations to portray my views on a borderless, diverse, sustainable and more unified world.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“Through my work, I strive to redefine the contemporary man through the exploration of male stereotypes, specifically the 21st-century American man. Through the deconstruction and fluid reassembly of the modern male uniform – the suit, the identity of masculinity is reinvented. I aim to design clothing that allows the everyday person to behave with vibrant emotions as a retaliation to the sterile world of capitalist decision-makers. This collection stresses the importance of a positive and dynamic form of masculinity, in contrast to the dull energy that has become a social normality in hopes of creating a healthy self-expression of male emotions.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“When designing I gather inspiration from many different aspects of my life and try and transfer this inspiration into print and knit whilst also applying my inspiration to the silhouette of the garments I make. More recently I have been finding inspiration from dreams which I have been having during lockdown, this inspiration has allowed me to produce garments that have challenged my ability of pattern cutting and also allowed me to develop my digital printing skills. In the future I would like to continue producing garments that are bold and colourful that apply my love for knit and print.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“There is a mania and fluidity in the way I work. As patterns, fabrics and colours come together to create a considered calm in the look overall. I work specifically with second-hand fabric, turning clothes into cloth and patterning them into pieces. Sustainability is at the core of my work as a designer. As we approach our second national lockdown I want to make my designs relevant in 2020 as protection becomes ever more synonymous with fashion. Gradually cloth will become our new skin. Our bodies and appearances sculpted into whoever we what to be perceived as. This year I begin to build my final collection for Central Saint Martins and it is important because it embodies sustainability in all layers, socially, physically and spiritually. Humans are not going to survive if we cannot understand and feel what we are doing to our planet. We all came from the jungle. It’s time we returned.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

      <![CDATA[






<p>The word most often used to describe <a href="/tag/marine-serre"><strong>Marine Serre</strong></a>’s designs is “dystopian”. That’s what a vision of the future seems like when artifice meets reality, when bodies are smothered in fabric as if to protect them from toxic elements, when faces are masked and when ‘couture’ is made from society’s detritus, from cast-off keychains and fleece blankets and old, lace-edged tablecloths. But maybe that word is wrong. “For me, utopia and dystopia, they are linked. You can have utopia only if you have dystopia,” Serre herself says. “It’s also funny because, before Covid-19, everyone said that I was dystopian. Now they think I am utopian.” She shrugs, a bit pixelated. “I don’t think I am a pessimist, I am quite realistic, even positive. I am trying to find solutions to survive in this world.”</p>
<p>Serre is pixelated because – like almost every conversation in <a href="/tag/another-magazine-autumnwinter-2020">this issue of AnOther Magazine</a> – our exchange is taking place virtually. I have never been to her studio, on the outskirts of Paris in the 19th arrondissement: it’s a stone’s throw from the ateliers of <a href="/tag/chanel">Chanel</a>’s Métiers d’art in Pantin, encompassing couture suppliers such as Lesage, Lemarié and Lognon. Serre’s studio is also a hub of creation, but rather than hand embroideries, her team are engrossed in unpicking existing pieces, recycling them into something new. They also call them couture, and they retail for similar, five-figure prices, each piece unique by the nature of the materials employed in their creation. About half of Serre’s seasonal styles are labelled as “regenerated” – designed around and produced from end-of-life product.</p>
<p>That originated in Serre’s teenage years: she wore vintage clothes, customised and reworked, which, while not tied with the environmental ideology she has today, did reflect an interest in the afterlife of existing objects. “I’d dress myself. I liked to express myself through garments,” she says. “I had a crowd of friends where we were really playing with dressing. What you are as an adolescent, you want to express yourself.” Despite that, Serre didn’t grow up wishing to be a fashion designer. “I did not dream at five years old to make garments,” she states, matter-of-factly. She grew up in southwest France, in a hamlet of only five houses, deep in the countryside near the commune of Brive-la-Gaillarde. She was an athlete, a tennis champion, whose dream of playing professionally was scuppered following an accident. There’s still an athletic feel to her clothes now, to all that Lycra clinging to bodies and outlining muscled limbs. She wants to make clothes people can move inside: she asks others to try on everything, to tell her how they feel. She still tries them herself, too.</p>
<p>And perhaps it’s the inherent competitive spirit of athletics that drove Serre, and still drives her today. “I know we are not perfect, I know I am not perfect, I know my designs are not perfect,” she says. Then she admits, laughing, “I am quite a perfectionist.” After studying applied arts at Cité Scolaire Raymond Loewy, a school near Limoges, she studied fashion for two years in Marseilles before moving to the prestigious La Cambre in Brussels, for five further years. She interned for <a href="/tag/sarah-burton">Sarah Burton</a> at <a href="/tag/alexander-mcqueen">Alexander McQueen</a>, for Matthieu Blazy at <a href="/tag/maison-martin-margiela">Maison Martin Margiela</a> and at <a href="/tag/christian-dior">Christian Dior</a> under <a href="/tag/raf-simons">Raf Simons</a>. That is quite a catalogue of experience and education: her time at La Cambre, however, was formative. “I wanted to be a perfect technician,” she says – that word again – and La Cambre taught her the sharp cutting and tailoring skills she uses today.</p>
<p>Weirdly, it doesn’t just feel like Serre is fashioning the clothes, but the human beings they lie on too, forms she stretches out and smooths over with jersey bodysuits before dressing them in fluid, scarf-like dresses or sharp, nip-waisted jackets. Serre’s <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2020-ready-to-wear/marine-serre">Autumn/Winter 2020 show</a> was called Mind Mélange Motor – a reference to Frank Herbert’s 1965 novel <em>Dune</em>, whose otherworldly survivalism chimes with her aesthetic. The invitation quoted it: “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>And that’s the flip side to Serre. Her fierce and aggressive clothes are not to be feared: once you grab hold of them, they are often soft, elastic and easy – sportswear that, albeit crazily elevated, still has the dynamism that label implies. Even her signature gimp masks – recurrent designs from her debut show in 2018 – aren’t intended to be scary, but rather to keep us safe. “I think the body is an important machine that carries all the rest,” Serre says. “I like to protect the body.” That said, context is everything. Those masks have always seemed prescient, politicised. If I were profiling her 12 months ago, I would be questioning if Serre’s masks were somehow linked with the controversy over France’s ban on full-face Islamic veils – in October 2018, the United Nations Human Rights Committee declared it a violation of human rights. As of late 2020, with masked faces mandatory in public spaces across Europe, it’s impossible not to connect them to the Covid-19 pandemic, even though she started using them so much earlier.</p>
<p>“I think they came from, actually, our menacing world,” says Serre, now. She’s possibly bored of talking about her masks, but she does because Serre is nothing if not a designer plugged into the moment in which she’s living, reflecting it, and reflecting on it. That’s what makes her interesting – always, but especially right now, when the world is frightening and much of fashion is thrashing around, trying to figure out its reaction. “The way I create is always in reaction to what is around us,” Serre says. “I really feel like a sponge, absorbing things, making links.” Fashion itself is always a kind of portent of the future, presenting collections six months in advance of the time they’re predicting. Serre’s predictions have been kind of spot on.</p>
<p>But back to masks. “They’re not new,” Serre says. “We are in this zone since the brand started. So if we were in a happy cute zone, I would maybe never have made masks. But it was already there. Like pollution in the street. You want to bike in Paris? If you don’t have a mask, honestly, you will have a hard time.” She bikes everywhere herself, and her masks are as much a practical gesture as a stylistic trope. “I think, also, it is leaning to the aggression of the world, of what we are living,” she says of her masks, and her look in general. Case in point: Serre’s June 2016 graduation collection from La Cambre was, in part, inspired by the terror attacks in Paris of 13 November 2015, and a series of attacks in Brussels in March 2016. She was nearby for both. In 2017, she was in Portland, Oregon, when wildfires broke out, and ended up at the top of a mountain, engulfed in smoke. She was thinking about that first-hand experience again in early 2020, as she was pulling together this collection, which came after the devastating Australian bushfires that ultimately consumed more than 46 million acres. She produced jeans with a bleached, smoky, sunburnt effect, and her logo – a crescent-moon shape – this time appeared scorched. “All the time, it’s tough,” Serre states. “All the time, you have to battle. I don’t know if it’s only me, but honestly I don’t think so. It’s a kind of combat, but in a good way.”</p>
<p>The combat isn’t just ecological. It’s a battle to be a young designer in a world like this, even with the success Serre has enjoyed. Her degree collection was picked up by the influential boutiques The Broken Arm in Paris and H Lorenzo in Los Angeles, readying her to begin her own line: in 2017, barely a year after she had left university, she won the prestigious LVMH Prize for young designers, the cash injection and attention allowing her to launch her label with her partner Pepijn van Eeden, to international acclaim. “It’s tough,” Serre says, unequivocally. “The first few years, I’d barely sleep. And not only me, other people working with me. You have to have a lot of courage, certainly when you want to change the ecosystem of fashion. When you have the ambition and the utopia to try to change the production chain when you are 23 and just starting out.”</p>
<p>Today, Serre is still only 28. Perhaps some of her tussles with the problems of young designers are over: she is still fighting, but the struggle is now ethical and ideological, to keep producing her clothes responsibly. “It’s a big struggle for us, for sure,” she says. “When we do plastic, it’s from the ocean. When we use polyester, it’s recycled. When we use wool for tailoring, it’s recycled, too. Even if it’s not regenerated from old garments ... Every day, you have to make it better and it’s never finished. And it never will be.”</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>A new month is upon us, and with it new lockdown restrictions for a number of countries. Nevertheless, we’ve compiled our monthly list of recommendations (some of which have now been postponed) with suggestions of great things to see and do once lockdown lifts, excellent new films to watch, and cheer-inducing food to feast upon.</p><h2><strong>Exhibitions</strong></h2><p><a href="https://online.victoria-miro.com/francescawoodman-venice2020/"><strong><em>Francesca Woodman: New York Works</em> at Victoria Miro, Venice: Until December 12, 2020</strong></a><br />In 2018, Victoria Miro Venice held a wonderful exhibition of works made by the late American photographer Francesa Woodman, taken in Italy between 1977 and 1978. Its latest show is a follow-up of sorts, focusing on the work Woodman made a year later, in 1979 – this time in her New York apartment, although the influence of Italian classicism remains strong. It’s a rare opportunity to see a selection of Woodman’s pastel-hued work in colour, alongside a number of typically striking black-and-white compositions. As you would expect, the photographs are largely centred on Woodman herself – balancing precariously on a chair; climbing a door frame; posing, partially draped, her head out of shot, to resemble a caryatid – culminating in a poetic exploration of identity and self-representation.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/zanele-muholi"><strong><em>Zanele Muholi</em> at Tate Modern, London: TBC until March 7, 2021</strong></a><br />Tate Modern’s latest (now sadly postponed) retrospective will centre on the esteemed South African photographer and self-described visual activist Zanele Muholi, who, since the early 00s, has devoted themself to documenting and celebrating the lives of South Africa’s Black lesbian, gay, trans, queer and intersex communities. The show will revisit key series from Muholi’s career, from <em>Faces and Phases – </em>a set of spellbinding portraits and accompaniying testimonies from “a community of people who are risking their lives by living authentically in the face of oppression and discrimination” – to <em>Being</em>, a tender, stereotype-shunning study of couples in love. It will also feature Muholi’s ongoing project <em>Somnyama Ngonyama</em> (meaning “Hail the Dark Lioness”), where, dressed in various guises, they turn the camera on themself to explore themes spanning labour, racism, Eurocentrism and sexual politics.​</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

The display features a new series of otherworldly tables alongside eye-catching sculptural artworks. At first glance, Audi’s iridescent pieces appear to have fallen from the sky or been mined from a crystal cave, but Audi is as much an alchemist as she is an artist, her awe-inspiring designs the result of endless material investigation (plus a total command of 3D printers and CNC machines).</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/bags"><strong><em>Bags: Inside Out</em> at The VA, London: TBC</strong></a><br />Accessory aficionados, rejoice: the VA has conjured up what promises to be the most comprehensive UK exhibition ever dedicated to the bag, set to open its doors as soon as the lockdown restrictions are lifted. Expect to peep countless seminal designs, including the first ever Birkin bag, dreamed up by the former executive chairman of Hermès Jean-Louis Dumas when he encountered a flustered Jane Birkin on an aeroplane (he sketched it on a sickness bag, no less); to enjoy an exclusive look inside the world of the factory and atelier; and to acquire an all-round immaculate schooling on all things baggage related, “from designer handbags to despatch boxes, vanity cases to military rucksacks”.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

This month, he will present his debut solo show with Mitchell-Innes  Nash in New York, where he will unveil a new series of work that incorporates “fictional and unknown places and people” for the first time. Whether turning his hand to domestic scenes of figures relaxing, or protagonists performing rituals in the wild outdoors, Appah’s “abstracted and fragmented worlds” serve as an extraordinarily evocative reflection on both personal experience and his country’s national history.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><a href="https://ewgalerie.com/exhibitions/"><strong><em>Thomas Jorion, Veduta</em> at Galerie Esther Woerdehoff, Paris: November 4 – 28, 2020</strong></a><br />Restrictions permitting, in Paris, the French photographer Thomas Jorion will soon present a series of images from his hypnotic photo book <em>Verduta</em>, expanding upon his enduring interest in abandoned spaces and places. For the past ten years, Jorion has travelled all over Italy, from Lago di Maggiore to Sicily, in search of the country’s deserted palaces – incredible monuments of bygone splendour. <em>Verduta</em> is the result, its pages filled with haunting depictions of these elegant ruins, replete with wall-to-ceiling frescoes and magnificent architectural details. A powerful meditation on the passing of time.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

This autumn, a joint exhibition at the Musée d’Orsay and the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, offers visitors an introspective look into the duo’s typographic archives, with a central focus on their series of anthropomorphic alphabets. These excellent amalgamations of people and letters started as a project for <em>V Magazine</em> in 2001, whereby the designers graphically transformed images of intricately posed models, taken by their frequent co-collaborators Inez and Vinoodh, into alphabetical letters. They’ve since gone on to produce four more alphabets, all of which will be on display, presented using a (rather intriguing sounding) “original modular device”.

<p><a href="https://www.luhringaugustine.com/exhibitions/frank-auerbach-selected-works-1978-2016"><strong><em>Frank Auerbach: Selected Works, 1978-2016 </em>at Luhring Augustine, New York: Until February 20, 2021</strong></a><br />This weekend marked the opening of an extensive exhibition of Frank Auerbach’s brilliantly expressive paintings and drawings at Luhring Augustine, New York. The selection aims to “underscore Auerbach’s great achievements in painting in the post-war era” and spans the prolific artist’s output from the 1970s up to 2016. It ranges from Auerbach's various impressions of the landscapes surrounding his London studio near Mornington Crescent, captured in his distinct heavily impastoed style, through vivid portraits of his devoted sitters, some of whom have been modelling for the painter for over 40 years. </p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><a href="https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/tracey-emin-edvard-munch"><strong><em>Tracey Emin / Edvard Munch: The Loneliness of the Soul </em>at the Royal Academy, London: TBC – February 28, 2021</strong></a><br />It is well known that Edvard Munch plumbed the depths of his own experiences and emotional states in the creation of his painfully poignant paintings, prints and drawings. So it is of little surprise to discover that Tracey Emin, Britain’s own purveyor of unflinchingly intimate and emotive art, has long been influenced by the Norwegian expressionist (she says she’s been in love with him since the age of 18). Soon, London’s Royal Academy will bring together a selection of 25 of Emin’s works, which explore “the loneliness of the soul” and were chosen by the artist herself, with 19 similarly searing paintings by Munch. Keep the tissues handy, this one’s sure to be a heart-wrencher.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><a href="http://ludwigforum.de/en/event/bon-voyage-2/"><strong><em>Bon Voyage! Travelling in Contemporary Art </em>at the Ludwig Forum, Aachen: TBC – April 11, 2020</strong></a><br />This year, the idea of travel has, for the majority of us, felt like a far-flung dream. And it was the ensuing sense of wanderlust that inspired the Ludwig Forum in Aachen, Germany’s forthcoming exhibition <em>Bon Voyage!</em>: a chance to tour the globe through the lens (or paintings, installations, videos, objects, photographs and prints, to be more precise) of some 60 artists, spanning the 1970s through today. From Marina Abramović and Ulay’s record-breaking walk along the Great Wall of China, to the emotionally infused observations of artists such as Hiroyuki Masuyama and Duane Michals, to more politically motivated journeys by the likes of Julian Charrière and Francis Alÿs, the exhibition promises to shed light on the many ways in which travel has inspired some of contemporary art’s key pioneers.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Il Mio Corpo, 2020. (Film still)        </figcaption>

    </figure>
<h2>Film</h2><p>Thankfully, there’s a plethora of new film releases across every genre to keep us occupied this month, and we’ve picked some of our favourites for your viewing pleasure. There are some brilliant documentaries in the pipeline, from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbA6WNK5XlU"><em><strong>Il Mio Corpo</strong></em></a>, Michele Pennetta’s stirring, semi-fictional portrait of a young working-class Italian boy and a Nigerian refugee as they navigate separate yet similar lives on the fringes of Sicilian society, to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mdfGJwlEaU"><strong><em>Idiot Prayer – Nick Cave Alone at Alexandra Palace</em></strong></a>, a moving opportunity to watch the singular musician in action, filmed by <em>American Honey</em> cinematographer, Robbie Ryan in an aptly empty concert hall. Not to mention <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKimh-iPd_0"><strong><em>Billie</em></strong></a><em>, </em>the fascinating story of journalist Linda Lipnack Kueh’s unfinished 1970s Billie Holiday biography, replete with never-before-heard interviews with the unparallelled songstress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeSkW1-Tw6kapp=desktop"><strong><em>Luxor</em></strong></a><strong>, </strong>Zeina Durra’s elegiac second feature, stars Andrea Riseborough as a British aid worker seeking solace on a trip to the ancient city of Luxor, where her past awaits her. Meanwhile, German director Faraz Shariat’s powerful drama <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGscwJZ5rFA"><strong><em>No Hard Feelings</em></strong></a> tells the story of a young, hard-partying, gay man of Iranian descent, who finds himself sentenced to community service at a refugee detention centre. An unexpected romance ensues, followed by the painful realisation that Germany’s immigration laws look likely to threaten his hopes for the future.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Cinephiles, don’t miss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Iud9lPZpN0"><em><strong>About Endlessness</strong></em></a>, the newest offering from Roy Andersson. Once again, the Swedish master of off-beat minimalism muses “on human life in all its beauty and cruelty, its splendour and banality” to unforgettable effect. A true tear-jerker, Harry Macqueen’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70Bt5pIxLPw"><em><strong>Supernova</strong></em></a> sees Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth star as a novelist and musician couple, who decide to embark on an emotional road trip when one of them is diagnosed with early-onset dementia. Meanwhile, Henry Blake’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYcTPZpgrx0"><em><strong>County Lines</strong></em></a> is a striking coming-of-age drama about a young teen groomed into joining a nation-wide drug-selling enterprise that exploits vulnerable youth. For lighter viewing, don’t miss Clea DuVall’s festive rom-com <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF0qUYKVtKs"><em><strong>Happiest Season</strong></em></a>, which sees Mackenzie Davis and <a href="/fashion-beauty/8369/the-full-shoot-kristen-stewart-by-paolo-roversi">Kristen Stewart</a> take centre stage in the tale of a young woman whose plan to propose to her girlfriend at a family party is scuppered by her discovery that her partner is yet to come out to her conservative parents.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2>Food and Drink</h2><p>Just because restaurants are shuttered for the time being, there’s still a lot of delicious food to be eaten. <strong><a href="https://asap.pizza/">ASAP Pizza</a></strong> has just returned to Flor in Borough Market, and will be offering takeaways and deliveries from next weekend. Toppings will range from firm favourites to new seasonal combinations, delivered on delectable handmade doughs that reflect head chef Pamela Yung’s passion for heritage British wheats. Barbecue fans can still get their fill as the evenings grow ever colder and shorter, courtesy of famously tasty London grill <strong><a href="https://smokestak.co.uk/">Smokestak</a></strong>, whose new delivery and takeaway service, and special at-home DIY boxes have arrived just in time for lockdown. Lastly, if you’re looking for mind-blowingly good comfort food, family-run pasta business <a href="https://nonnatonda.co.uk/"><strong>Nonna Tonda</strong></a> delivers weekly boxes of freshly handmade pasta of all varieties and an accompanying sauce, which can be cooked (and consumed) in five minutes flat. Enjoy!</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[






<p>Since its invention almost two centuries ago, photography has become both art and artifact, artifice and evidence, documenting the world in which we live. Granted access to the most exclusive of spaces, photojournalists play an extraordinary role in writing a first draft of history, recording it even as it unfolds. In bearing witness to historic events, their images have the power to shape and shift public opinion without uttering a single word, and while some may strive to be objective, such a task is arguably impossible.</p>
<p>The media plays an integral role in US presidential elections, from what it chooses to cover to how it frames the stories it tells. The new exhibition, <strong><a href="https://www.monroegallery.com/"><em>The Campaign</em></a></strong>, curated by gallerists Sid and Michelle Monroe, explores how images inform our perception of candidates running for the highest office in the world. Featuring work by Bill Eppridge, Irving Haberman, Cornell Capa, Bill Ray, John Loengard, Alfred Eisenstaedt, and Neil Leifer, among others, <em>The Campaign</em> illustrates how the photography has become an inextricable part of the political narrative over the past 75 years.</p>
<p>“What struck us when we were curating the show is that the themes of restoration of the country, corruption of my opponent, aspiration for the young, civil inequities, working people’s inequities, these keep recycling almost as if all of these issues are a part of the American personality,” says Monroe. “Each campaign seems to decide and direct which part they are going to amplify.” Here, the Monroes offer an insight into the making of five iconic images of the US presidential race.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<h3><strong>Bill Eppridge: Bobby Kennedy campaigns in Indiana during May of 1968, with various aides and friends: former prizefighter Tony Zale and (right of Kennedy) NFL stars Lamar Lundy, Rosey Grier, and Deacon Jones (lead image)</strong></h3>
<p>“Bill Eppridge was a sweetheart. His career spanned everything from Vietnam, Civil Rights, and sports, but he as fate as would have it was the photographer who captured Robert Kennedy’s assassination [on 6 June 1968] so he was on the campaign from the beginning to the bitter end.</p>
<p>“This image was an outtake. It was never published. Bill brought it to us and he wasn’t even sure who everybody was in the picture so we had this wonderful time reconstructing it because he didn’t have notes. RFK made a point of campaigning in a convertible in every town and city he went into. He was warned and he said. ‘If they want to get me, they’re going to get me.’</p>
<p>“Bill said that at night Bobby would travel with members of his family, put them to bed in the hotel, then come down and seek out journalists who had been in Vietnam because he wanted to know everything about what they had seen and what they thought. Bill said he struggled because it became very difficult to be not emotional and not to get connected to this campaign.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3>Grey Villet: Senator John F Kennedy and his sisters walking with Governor Michael V Di Salle and Governor Abraham A Ribicoff, Los Angeles, CA, 1960</h3>
<p>“Grey Villet was a South African photographer who came to America. He was very quiet. He wasn’t as swashbuckling as a lot of the <em>Life</em> photographers were but he was extremely versatile. When you think about the versatility required in covering a presidential campaign, a riot, a rocket liftoff to space – the profession doesn’t get enough credit for what it requires of what we consider artists.</p>
<p>“In this era, every single one of these photographers was largely self-taught. For that versatility, they didn’t study to be specialised so when it came to an assignment this is where the innovation, artistry, athleticism, creativity would come in. Grey made this wonderful image that captures the aura of the Kennedy Mystique.</p>
<p>“We have this image of Kennedy commanding the campaign but the reality was the 1960 Democratic National Convention was highly contested between Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson.  The photograph shows Kennedy with his sisters in the background, other politicians with him, and women in these wonderful hats. He is bringing the full Kennedy Mystique into the convention to sway those delegates in a way that Johnson couldn’t. Johnson was much more gruff and brash and Kennedy was trying to put on a show.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3>Hank Walker/The Life Picture Collection: Presidential candidate John F Kennedy planning convention strategy with his brother and campaign manager, Robert, Hotel Biltmore, Los Angeles, CA, 1960</h3>
<p>“In the 1960 presidential campaign, John F Kennedy’s platform was that we are now a ‘New America’. We’re a younger, more aspirational people and we’re going to have to come together. Nixon’s strategy was the Southern Strategy [which appealed to white supremacy to increase Republican turnout in the South, just as the Civil Rights Movement was reaching new heights and segregation was being dismantled]. Nixon wanted to divide and invoke the fear the racial equality will change our lives and traditions forever.</p>
<p>“This photograph was made just when Kennendy was telling his brother Robert that for strategic reasons he has agreed with his advisors to name [then Texas Senator] Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate. Hank Walker, working for Life magazine, said he took one photograph in that room and left immediately afterwards because of the tension. He stepped outside and shut the door. When the discussion was over, moments later, RFK came out and slammed his fist into his open palm, over and over again, saying, ‘Shit! Shit! Shit!’”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3><strong>Joe McNally: Joe Biden, 1988</strong></h3>
<p>“Joe Biden was a Democratic candidate for President in 1987. One of the factors that ended his campaign was the discovery of a life-threatening aneurysm. He was out of commission for some time. The photograph was taken upon his return, just outside his Senate office. Biden came back as a hero who could speak to both sides of the aisle.</p>
<p>“Joe McNally, who is a very down to earth New Yorker, will tell you what’s what. He walked away saying, ‘This is the real deal. Biden is a genuine nice guy. I saw how he was received, but also just how he spent time with me. It’s a cliche but he’s a regular Joe.’”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3><strong>Brooks Kraft: President Barack Obama campaigns in the rain, Glen Allen, Virginia, 2012</strong></h3>
<p>“Brooks Kraft covered both Obama presidential campaigns; he also covered the White House for <em>Time</em> magazine. What’s remarkable is that this rally was cut short because it rained torrentially. The circumstance speaks volumes about Obama as a candidate and as a President: that he went head first into the campaign. It’s a very heroic pose. It’s very rock and roll.</p>
<p>“It also speaks to the fitness of a photographer not to be daunted by the rain, to stick it out, to be looking for something different. It’s a transcendent image and one of those moments any photographer would look back at and say, ‘I can’t believe I got that.’ You position yourself to be available something like this should something like this present itself.</p>
<p>“We hear this over and over again from journalists: they’re cold, they’re wet, they’re hungry, they’re pushed around, they’re abused, they’re spit on. It’s really a missionary kind of dedication. We feel so devoted to these photographers. It’s so vital to our democracy to tell these stories – and to tell them unimpeded, which has been increasingly tampered with. As Orwell said, ‘Much of what is important for us to see and read we are not meant to know.’”</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>From Dior and Fendi director Kim Jones, to fashion heiress Margherita Missoni and designer Rosetta Getty, the list of home-owners featured in <strong>Alex Eagle</strong>’s book <em>More Than Just a House: at Home with Collectors and Creators</em> (<a href="https://www.rizzoliusa.com/book/9780847867714/">Rizzoli</a>) reads like a who’s who of the creative elite. “Most of the people in the book are my friends,” explains Eagle, whose own home is in Soho, London. “The inspiration for the book came from the homes. It was that feeling of being in someone’s home and being delighted and overwhelmed by it.”</p>
<p>Having begun her career at <em>Tank</em> and <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>, before moving into the PR world in her role at British fashion label Joseph, Eagle is the very definition of ‘connected’. In 2014 she launched her eponymous concept store, Alex Eagle Studio, blending fashion and lifestyle. Having cemented her position as an authority on luxury style, she has teamed up with publisher Rizzoli to realise an idea a decade in the making. “The concept of the book had been in my head for about ten years – I was collecting the people for it like they collected things for their homes.” Having teamed up with photographer Kate Martin and writer Tish Wrigley, the trio took their time creating <em>More Than Just A House</em>, savouring the unique experience of shooting people in their homes. “We weren’t trying to get it all done in six months, we took a couple of years,” notes Eagle. “Most of the houses I’ve got a special memory of – of staying with the owner or visiting. It’s nice talking to people when they’re in their own home. You really see the real them, and the way they use the things around them and make you a cup of tea and feel relaxed.”</p>
<p>While the book does feature some of the most lavish interiors you’re ever likely to see, Eagle insists that this is not a book about interior design. “The idea was to document the people that inspire me. I had a desire to capture them, to tell everyone that these people are cool, interesting people who I feel are going to be even more interesting in years to come. It’s a documentation of what’s going on culturally or creatively around the world.” While it may not be a design book per se, there are plenty of style tips Eagle took away from the experience:</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<h3>1. Don’t be scared of a souvenir</h3>
<p>“Some houses had really amazing pieces of art and design furniture, but a lot of them had things that people had collected and loved and brought them joy. The inspiring things weren’t always things of high value, it was more personal value. It was holiday memorabilia or things their kids had made, or things they’d bought for themselves that reflected a milestone in their life.”</p>
<h3>2. Don’t rely on an interior designer</h3>
<p>“None of the houses were done by an interior designer. It was a slightly eclectic feeling of things collected over the years. No home was completely homogenous. They weren't done ‘in the style of’, they felt they’d be collected and built over time.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h3>3. Love conquers all</h3>
<p>“If you love it, it should work. It’s about collecting something not in a theme but because you can make it work if you like it. It was mixing a designer chair with a flea market find or something they’d found on eBay. It was pieces being joyful or personal, rather than being picked for a room.”</p>
<h3>4. Collect furniture, not art</h3>
<p>“Good bits of design are really worth investing in. They act like a piece of artwork and a piece of furniture. I definitely found it inspiring seeing really important and special bits of design furniture being used in a decorative and functional way. If you’re investing in pieces then furniture is a great choice. They often do more than a piece of art can.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h3>5. Think illogically</h3>
<p>“Have fun with colour! It was the mismatching of things I found really inspiring. There was no rhyme or reason to it and that was a real takeaway for me. Don’t overthink the palette and keep everything in the style of something.”</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>When <strong>Josephine Decker</strong> first received the script for <em><strong>Shirley</strong>, </em>a semi-fictional Shirley Jackson biopic penned by Sarah Gubbins after Susan Scarf Merrell’s novel of the same name, it felt like serendipity. “I’d just read Shirley’s final novel <em>We Have Always Lived in the Castle</em>, and was like, ‘Oh my God, Shirley’s amazing. I need to go read all of her work,’” the American director tells AnOther over the phone. “Then the script landed in my lap out of the blue. It was crazy timing.”</p>
<p>Decker, known for her avant-garde brand of independent filmmaking which plunges viewers into the tempestuous minds of her subjects through experimental sound and camerawork, presented her pitch for the film and soon found herself at the helm of what would be her first commercial movie. Shortly thereafter, she found her Shirley in the inimitable Elisabeth Moss, who embodies Jackson with a wonderfully frumpy physicality and wild-eyed unpredictability, in what is one of her best performances yet. “We showed Elisabeth the script and she loved it and came onboard, not only as Shirley but also as a producer,” Decker explains. “She’s so talented and has such a deep, mysterious grasp on reality. She has a whole universe inside of her eyes that she can play with.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/3/403097.jpg" alt="SHIRLEY Michael Stuhlbarg Elisabeth Moss_CourtesyN" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>The film homes in on the much-mythologised doyenne of American horror in 1948, the same year that she skyrocketed to notoriety after her blood-curdling short story <em>The Lottery</em> was published in <em>The New Yorker</em>. Jackson and her husband, the literary critic Stanley Hyman (played by Michael Stuhlbarg of <em>A Serious Man </em>and <em>Call Me By Your Name </em>fame), are living in a creaky, old, ivy-covered house in Vermont. Stanley, a charismatic and lechy <em>bonvivant</em>, is a lecturer at Bennington College, while the hermetic and brilliantly mercurial Jackson is beginning work on her second novel, <em>Hangsaman</em>, inspired by the recent disappearance of a female student on campus. Theirs is a toxic relationship, all acerbic quips and wicked wit, and yet they are devoted to one another.</p>
<p>So far, so close to the truth, but the film veers off into fiction when young newlyweds Fred (Logan Lerman) and Rose (<strong>Odessa Young</strong>) appear on the scene. Fred, a bushy-tailed PhD graduate, will assist Stanley in his lecturing, while Rose, who is pretty and seemingly straightlaced in spite of her deep fascination for Shirley’s work, will study at the college. Things soon take a disconcerting turn, however, when Stanley cajoles Rose into assuming the role of housekeeper and carer for Shirley, who in turn prompts an unexpected awakening in the repressed young woman as they conspire to unearth the mystery of the missing student. What ensues is a blistering collision of reality and unreality, as Shirley ignites Rose’s fertile imagination and latent desire to rebel, while Rose comes to inspire the “lost girl” at the heart of Shirley’s novel.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>The ascendant Australian actress Odessa Young, who was only 20 at the time of filming, is excellent as Rose, pulling the audience with her as she stumbles under Shirley’s spell. “We were so excited when we cast Odessa,” Decker affirms. “We found a Rose that had a lot of fight in her – we liked that freedom, that ferocity. Rose was always going to have a life beyond that first ‘1940s housewife’ version that we meet and Odessa was willing to go to that scarier, more vulnerable place. She was up against these incredible actors and yet she holds the movie; she’s the eyes through which you see the whole film, and she did it so well.”</p>
<p>Young, on her part, was thrilled to work with Decker. “I’d seen Josephine’s previous film <em>Madeline’s Madeline</em> and it was just kind of mind blowing. I was really curious to see how she made it, her process,” she tells AnOther. And what did she discover? “She’s kind of a magic person. Her way of filmmaking is all-encompassing, very spiritual and very esoteric. Watching the film for the first time, I noticed how she and Sturla Brandth Grøvlen, the cinematographer, had captured all of these hidden moments while we were shooting the scenes – like the little subconscious ticks that you have as a person, not even as an actor. It was a beautiful melting pot of all these things from real life and fiction, these elements of performance and of being.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/3/403130.jpg" alt="SHIRLEY Michael Stuhlbarg Elisabeth Moss_CourtesyN" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>Hearing Decker discuss her approach to creating the astounding visual world of Shirley gives further insight into the spellbindly immersive effect of the film. “The movie is very complex: it moves from Rose’s perspective slowly into Shirley’s perspective, so you have to really balance all the different layers of whose mind you’re in when,” she says. “We had a lot of different approaches for shooting. The Shirley and Stanley scenes [marvellously theatrical, intellectual showdowns] are very action-based, for example – we would really let the physical movement define the camerawork.” Other camera wizardry included a technique that Decker and Grøvlen dubbed “creature”, where “the camera’s supposed to be like a baby that crawls; it sits very close to the body and if it wants to go to places it has to crawl along the furniture or floor to get there.”</p>
<p>They also worked hard to conjure two distinct universes: the one inside Shirley’s house, where most of the action takes place, and the town of Bennington beyond. Shirley and Stanley’s dwelling is always dimly lit, and brims with books and witchy symbology – a black cat, a caged yellow canary, a miniature replica of the Boy With Thorn statue – while the ever-sunny town and its squeaky clean inhabitants are somehow even more sinister. “When you leave the house and go to the town, you’re meant to feel like you’ve left the world of the movie, like in one of Shirley’s stories. We had a lot of fun digesting and jumping into all that,” Decker enthuses.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="r3CBGJVSVHg"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3CBGJVSVHg" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>During the course of our conversation, the filmmaker reveals several other tricks she had up her sleeve in the realisation of this mind-bending film and its many layers – the real, the imagined, the dreamt. This ranges from the late addition of a voiceover of Shirley’s writing process at certain stages of the film, so that we're better able to trace the links between her novel’s development and her changing relationship to Rose, to some exercises Decker learned while studying at physical theatre school, which she did with the actors in order to establish the “physical vocabulary of the film”.</p>
<p>But, as with a magic trick, the joy of <em>Shirley </em>is in the experience, the wondery of watching it unfurl. This film, like Decker’s three preceding features, is hard to put into words. It’s so many things rolled into one: a period psychodrama about a time when (in Shirley’s words) “the world [was] too cruel to girls”; a heady study of the art of writing (one of the best Martin Scorsese says he’s ever seen, incidentally); a biopic that explodes outside the margins of the genre and merges the life of its subject with the singular fictional world she crafted. To conclude on a festive note, much like a Halloween candy haul, it’s sickening and delicious in equal measure, and demands to be consumed.</p>

<p>The team behind Beirut Re-Store have partnered with non-profit organisation <strong>Creatives For Lebanon</strong> for its latest project – a sale of bespoke designs created exclusively by an international roster of established and emerging brands, which will go live at 4pm (GMT) today. The impressive line-up includes one-off creations by Dior, Jean Paul Gaultier, Supriya Lele, Alaïa, Christian Louboutin, Heron Preston, M Missoni, Acne, GCDS, Mary Katrantzou, and more. Each label was asked to either create something entirely new or reimagine a well-loved design for the initiative, which is raising money for LIFE Generation USA, a charity providing immediate aid in the wake of the blast while raising funds for education through scholarship programmes. In addition, Creatives For Lebanon has collaborated with artist Luke Edward Hall to create illustrations of the designs, which are also available to shop from today. </p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“Since my very first visit to Beyrouth, Lebanon is dear to my heart,” Christian Louboutin said in a statement. “Do I need to explain or mention the legendary warmth and the hospitality so linked to this country? I don’t think so! Those who know and have been to Lebanon do not need any explanation for loving this country and its inhabitants.” “I’m beyond happy to contribute with M Missoni to this noble project developed by some of the most brilliant people in the international creative industry,” Margherita Missoni added. “What happened in Lebanon in August is horrifying and we all should feel the responsibility to take concrete actions to support a country and a population that is experiencing its worst economic crisis since the civil war.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Sex and death make fascinating partners. Freud’s fundamental human drives Eros and Thanatos are both equally present in the photography and writing of <strong>Hervé Guibert</strong>, who is quite possibly the most interesting artist exploring desire to have been forgotten in the past 30 years – and the subject of an exciting new exhibition at Felix Gaudlitz in Vienna.</p>
<p>Guibert did not restrict himself to one medium. Originally an actor and director, he was a prolific photographer, the first photographic columnist at <em>Le Monde</em>, as well as a novelist, penning more than 25 books over the course of his career. His diaristic book <em>À l'ami qui ne m'a pas sauvé la vie</em> (<em>To the Friend Who Did Not Save My Life</em>), which was recently translated and published by Semiotext(e), transformed France’s attitude to AIDS. This fictionalised portrait of Guibert’s theorist Michel Foucault was also a reflection of the artist’s own experience of the disease that ultimately led to his death in 1991, aged just 35. His relationship to Aids was complicated, as he wrote, “I was discovering something sleek and dazzling in its hideousness.” Guibert even created a film of himself at the end of his life, which was broadcast on French television in 1992.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>He was as talented at making friends as he was making art, including iconic actresses Gina Lollobrigida and Isabelle Adjani as his confidants. Looking at his self-portraits, all ringlets and come-to-bed eyes, he was more than aware of his beauty, which many noted was combined with a Machavellian temperament. After he rejected Roland Barthes, the writer wrote a hurt letter to Guibert, who later published it. <em>To the Friend</em> also posthumously outed Foucault as gay.</p>
<p>The longest partner and collaborator in Guibert’s life was photographer Hans Georg Berger, who was equally a subject of his work. Bent over a daybed in Elba, opening curtains half dress at the Villa Medici, where Guibert had a residency, intimacy is something that emerges throughout Guibert’s black and white photographs, which reveal something innately personal.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Somehow Guibert is an amalgam of many of the great queer artists of the twentieth century. His images echo the sensuality and darker edges of Peter Hujar, his documents of the experience of Aids are an interesting foil to activist-artist David Wojnarowicz, his writing draws on the rebellious, boundary-breaking representation of homosexuality of Jean Genet, while he himself had some of the public focus and poetic inclinations of Derek Jarman. He was all these artists combined, but also his own entity. His writing was a precursor to the very contemporary genre of autofiction, as he once wrote “my lovers and my friends are my characters, it’s my fictional coherence.” His novel <em>Crazy for Vincent</em>, for example, is a document of erotic obsession and love.</p>
<p>The photographs on show now at Felix Gaudlitz in Vienna – as part of the exhibition entitled <em>Hervé Guibert ... of lovers, time, and death –</em> and soon brought together in a new book, are filled with shadows. In these images, we often look at the back of the protagonist, over their shoulder, onto their naked bodies. The gaze that meets the camera most is the artist’s own, daring us to look back.</p>
<p><em>Hervé Guibert ... of lovers, time, and death is at <a href="https://felixgaudlitz.com/exhibitions/herve-guibert-of-lovers-time-and-death/">Felix Gaudlitz</a>, Vienna until 28 November 2020. The accompanying book is published by </em><em><a href="http://saxpublishers.com/">saxpublishers</a>.</em></p>]]>

<p><strong>Jackie Nickerson</strong> is one of the most profound image- and film-makers working today. Deeply meditative, the American-born British artist’s work examines what it is like – physically and psychologically – to work within specific environments. <em>Farm</em> (2005) and <em>Terrain</em> (2013) explore farm labour, the relationship between the land (in Southern and East Africa) and the people who work upon it, while <em>Faith</em> (2007) and <em>Ten Miles Round</em> (2009) look at similar relationships but in Ireland – the religious and rural communities that can be found there, respectively.</p>
<p>While these series examine heady subjects such as identity – who we are, how we change the world around us and how, in turn, it changes us – they also embody extraordinarily beautiful portraits and landscapes, too. Nickerson’s latest book, <strong><em>Field Test</em></strong> (published by Kerber), is no exception. Featuring powerful and at times perplexing photographs, which actually feel more like sculptures than portraits, the publication explores the collective trauma of modern living; how the things that are unseen change us. Things, says Nickerson, like “globalisation, technology and medicine, commercialisation, mass production, environmental pollution, migration, digitisation, fake news and pandemics”. Things that feel all too familiar, all too ... traumatic.</p>
<p>Here, Nickerson tells us more about this book and its themes, and what she feels is the power of photo books.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><strong>Ted Stansfield: Please could you introduce </strong><strong><em>Field Test</em></strong><strong> to us?</strong></p>
<p>Jackie Nickerson: Yes. It’s a series of constructed images about the collective trauma of modern living. In a way, it’s about the mundane things and hidden forces in your life, which you don’t have any knowledge or control over.</p>
<p><strong>TS: Could you describe the process of creating it?</strong></p>
<p>JN: It started in 2014 when <em>Time</em> magazine sent me to Liberia to cover the Ebola epidemic. I became very aware of the processes and paraphernalia around healthcare. The materials that protect, but also obscure identity and the psychological effects of not being recognisable. This got me thinking about the unseen things that we use everyday. Like the internet.</p>
<p><strong>TS: What are some of the themes you explore?</strong></p>
<p>JN: Mostly it’s about the psychological effects of things that are not overt – and how we are being changed by them – globalisation, technology and medicine, commercialisation, mass production, environmental pollution, migration, digitisation, fake news and pandemics.</p>
<p>I sometimes feel like the technological practices in our everyday lives – the digital processes that we all use – are changing the way our brains work. And there’s very little room to opt out of this.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>TS: Some of these themes feel especially pertinent to this time we’re living in – the age of coronavirus – but you created the book before the pandemic. How do you feel about this?</strong></p>
<p>JN: Yes, well, I suppose the World Health Organisation has been talking about the danger of a worldwide pandemic for a while now, so it’s not really surprising. When I saw the Ebola outbreak it became real for me. I suppose the timing is just a fluke but there have been other recent outbreaks – like Sars.</p>
<p><strong>TS: How does <em>Field Test</em> relate to your previous publications, </strong><strong><em>Farm</em></strong><strong>, </strong><strong><em>Terrain</em>,</strong> <strong><em>Faith</em> and <em>Ten Miles Round</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>JN: I have an interest in cause and effect. How things to a certain degree work within the law of nature. We are not isolated – there is an inevitable cohesion as we all live together on this planet. So this idea of how we are human, and how we interact with our environment is what I’m interested in.</p>
<p><strong>TS: I’m interested in what motivates you, in terms of your artistic practice.</strong></p>
<p>JN: I think most artists will tell you that – the ideas, the drive – it’s just there. I see things and I see how diverse things can perhaps work together. It’s my job to investigate that and ask those questions. I love what I do.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/771/azure/another-prod/400/3/403060.jpg" alt="Chimera II, 2019" />        <figcaption>

<p><strong>TS: In a recent interview for AnOther, Tyler Mitchell said photo books are “even more important than a show, which seems to be the marker of success” (for photographers). Do you agree? What do you feel is the power of photo books?</strong></p>
<p>JN: Yes. I think both are important but a book lasts forever and it’s an artifact you can keep. Francis Bacon said that he thought his paintings worked better in a series. Sometimes the narrative is a really important part of the work and a series illustrates an idea better than a single image. So books are a great way of achieving this. But that said, it’s always great to see work produced as an actual photograph and see it hanging on a wall.</p>
<p><strong>TS: Do you buy them yourself? Do you have a favourite?</strong></p>
<p>JN: I buy lots of books about photography, design, architecture and sculpture. I recently bought a brilliant Dieter Rams design book. You can clearly see how his work from the 1950s has influenced industrial design today. </p>
<p><strong>TS: Another thing I’m interested to know: how does it feel to create something that then becomes a rare and valuable commodity and a special and treasured possession (to someone like me!)?</strong></p>
<p>JN: [Laughs.] Thank you! I hope I can produce work that some people might want to look at.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><a href="/search?q=miu+miu"><strong>Miu Miu</strong></a>’s Christmas campaign is centered around the idea of the ‘icon’ – a word which, though admittedly overused in recent times, represents something more than just a “symbol worthy of veneration” to the Miuccia Prada-helmed brand, instead representing “a set of beliefs, a way of life”. Showcasing the label’s Pre-Spring 2021 collection, this campaign features an A-list ensemble, including established and emerging stars such as Chloë Sevigny, Kim Basinger, Du Juan and Raffey Cassidy, with Emma Corrin, Jordan Kristine Seamón and Storm Reid. “Their unifying trait is their absolute individuality,” says Miu Miu.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>The campaign is photographed by Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, with creative direction by Katie Grand, capturing Miu Miu’s icons in pastel hues and crystal-adorned clothes featuring vintage-inspired frills and bold patterns. Much like the ethos of the label itself, the campaign’s images fuse notions of girlhood with feminine strength – something that is perhaps felt most keenly in Basinger’s spread.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>The campaign continues a long-standing relationship with Miu Miu for Basinger, who has starred in campaigns for the Italian house before – like Du Juan, Raffey Cassidy, and fellow actor Chloë Sevigny. Sevigny has in fact been a poster girl for Miu Miu near-since the brand’s advent, first modelling for the label back in 1996 when she was just 22.</p>
<p>These established Miu Miu role models are joined by a wave of fresh, new personalities for the icon campaign: Sevigny’s <a href="/design-living/12668/luca-guadagnino-new-hbo-we-are-who-we-are-air-date-uk-trailer-chloe-sevigny"><em>We Are Who We Are</em></a> co-star Jordan Kristine Seamón, Emma Corrin, who stars as Princess Diana in the much-anticipated new series of <em>The Crown</em>, and <em>Euphoria</em>-star Storm Reid, who also opened Miu Miu’s Autumn/Winter 2020 show. “Each adds a depth and richness to the Miu Miu universe,” says the label of their holiday heroines. “A cast comprising actors and performers is inherently keyed to the meaning of Miu Miu – of transformation, of reinvention, of a woman who can be women.”</p>]]>

<p><em>AnOther has teamed up with iconic Irish whiskey brand Jameson for AnOther Door Opens, a celebration of local bars, which have long played a crucial role in creativity and connection – but are currently facing extreme hardship due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Bar-hopping from London to Jakarta to Sydney, we’ll speak to the driving forces behind three small-but-perfectly-formed bars connected by shared values of togetherness and creative collaboration. We’ll spell out a portrait of each venue, discovering what community and openness means today in the age of social distancing.</em></p><p>What does an open door signify to you? Perhaps it’s an entrance. Or maybe it’s an invitation. Alternatively it could be a metaphor. A way in, a way out or even a way forward. As we move towards the tail end of a year which most of us have locked down at home, what does it mean to be open? We headed inside Sydney-based bar Earl’s Juke Joint to try and find out.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>The story behind Earl’s began back in 2013 when the bar’s co-owner Pasan Wijesena decided that there was an absence of bars locally. Newtown lies in the suburbs of Sydney, a lively and community-centred neighbourhood which, in recent years, has become a thriving network of thrift shops, independent bars and restaurants. “I’d been living in Newtown for about five years at the time, and it always annoyed me that all the ‘good’ bars were in the city or Eastern suburbs,” Wijesena remembers. “I figured if I opened a bar that my mates and I would like, maybe some other people might like it too.”</p>
<p>Wijesena took the unconventional decision to take over a former butcher shop, Betta Meats, which had been vacant for a while. At first, the reincarnation from butcher’s shop to bar raised some eyebrows locally. “We’re only the second tenant to be in the building, the butcher had been there for over 50 years and the family still owns the building,” Wijesena says. But intent on keeping the original signage, from the red lettering spelling out BETTA MEATS to the banners advertising Top Quality Meats and Continental Smallgoods, Wijesena held tightly to a lasting connection with the past. “I kept the front signage as a tip of the cap to the family, wanting to preserve that history of such an iconic local shop,” Wijesena says.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>Much has rightly been written about gentrification. When newcomers arrive in a neighborhood with more income or education than the existing residents, change is inevitable, often in the form of displacement affecting those most vulnerable. Newtown is a neighbourhood in transition. And at first, local residents were hesitant to have a bar open in the area. Yet in the years since, they have found their way through Earl’s Juke Joint’s always-open door to become part of the bar’s legacy. “I can’t tell you how many of those people have become close friends,” Wijesena reflects. “I’ve seen people come on first dates, and then get married and come back with a baby.” With an open-door policy, bars like Earl’s can evolve alongside their neighbourhood to become part of the fabric. “I love that our bar has had its success and can act as an ambassador for Newtown, an area that I love deeply,” Wijesena says.</p>
<p>Of course, change is life’s only constant. During lockdown in Sydney, the connection that Wijesena clearly feels with his community birthed a sense of energy which instilled positivity and forward motion at a moment of global stasis. With the support of neighbouring companies, old aprons were repurposed into protective face masks. The staff came together “like voltron” to run a bottle shop and manage photo shoots for the online sales portal.

<p>In Sydney, as in cities around the world, the pandemic has brought friends, families, neighbours and communities closer, opening the door to a version of humanity which, before lockdown, seemed in danger of fading away. “The glue that held it all together has been the support for local business,” Wijesena reflects. “That has always been a feature of the area, and it has only been magnified now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.earlsjukejoint.delivery/">Earl’s Juke Joint</a> may be known for great decor and an even better roster of Jameson whiskey cocktails, but Wijesena insists that the secret ingredient behind his success can be found in human connection. “Otherwise it’s just a lot of very pretty wood.” he says wryly. “Having a sense of connection to the local area, a fraternal atmosphere and culture between the staff and regulars is something that you can’t fake. Drinks are about ten per cent of the job. The rest is being a host, a tour guide, a mate.”</p>

<p><em>Introducing <strong><a href="/new-beginnings">New Beginnings</a></strong>, a new series of mini QAs spotlighting emerging designers, in the wake of <a href="/fashion-beauty/12822/cover-story-craig-mcdean-katie-shillingford-emerging-designers-2020">Craig McDean and Katie Shillingford’s shoot</a> for <a href="/tag/another-magazine-autumnwinter-2020">AnOther Magazine Autumn/Winter 2020</a>.</em></p><p><strong>AnOther Magazine: What are your hopes for the future?</strong></p>
<p>Conner Ives: I have a lot [of hopes for the future], but the biggest one is for America to return to some form of imperfect justice. Instead of what it is now ... It has been so hard to watch this all unfold from here – I feel a lost sense of my American identity. It has never been a perfect country, but I really want it to be. I hope it to be.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What is the thinking behind your work?</strong></p>
<p>CI: My work is an exploration of American identity through poignant memories of growing up there. I only gained my appreciation for American culture after coming to London. Here, I became homesick and the culture that I was so desperate to escape became my strongest inspiration. I thought back to what my friends wore in high school, what their mothers wore, the ‘status symbol’ items of that time in my life: Patagonia fleeces, yoga pants, Livestrong bracelets ... My work is about looking at these items, subverting them and creating something new in the process.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What three words would you use to describe your approach to fashion?</strong></p>
<p>CI: Sexy, sustainable and silly.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What does community mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>CI: I consider community to mean a group of like-minded individuals, but maybe communities don’t have to be like-minded. Perhaps they can share things other than their interests and still be considered a community, like proximity ... People who live close to each other may not be like-minded, but they are still a community.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What community did you grow up around? How did that shape you?</strong></p>
<p>CI: I grew up in Bedford, New York. It’s upstate New York, about an hour outside of the city. I’ve always described it as the picturesque suburban American upbringing, almost strangely movie-like. When I first got to London people would always ask me if the red solo cups littered in house parties in movies were real, if we actually drank out of them. I had thought the world had red solo cups everywhere. I started to realise the people and scenes I grew up around, which often felt so mundane to me, were [actually] quite unique and inspiring. I’m inspired by the trends I remember from high school. I think at the time I hated them because it was so repetitive – there wasn’t much individuality – but now those pack-chosen trends are burned into my subconscious and feel novel in my new context of community, working here in London.</p>

<p>Despite his dramatic departure on the eve of World War II from his birth city of Berlin, <a href="/tag/helmut-newton"><strong>Helmut Newton</strong></a> had never forgotten its formative influence on his life and work. It was the place he had learned to be a photographer and where stark Nazi iconography played a major role in shaping his vision – even though he grew up in a Jewish family. He returned periodically to Berlin after the war to shoot fashion editorials and fondly revisited his old neighborhood as witnessed in the 2002 German documentary of his life, <em>Mein Leben</em>.</p>
<p>At the end of October, the Helmut Newton Foundation will fete the provocative fashion photographer throughout Berlin on what would have been his 100th birthday with <em>Helmut Newton One Hundred</em>. Photos spanning his career will be presented along an 85 meter-long wall in Kreuzberg in addition to City Light posters around the city and a viewing of the recently released documentary on Newton, <a href="/design-living/12905/helmut-newton-the-bad-and-the-beautiful-documentary-film"><em>The Bad and the Beautiful</em></a>.</p>
<p>But who was this controversial figure behind the lens? And how did he conduct himself on photo shoots? Oft-mentioned were his unforgettable humour and undeniable reverence of bold women, connecting these five, distinct personal histories of candid, poignant observations – with a little bit of a wink.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<h2>Gero von Boehm</h2>
<p><em>Gero von Boehm is the director of the 2020 documentary, </em>The Bad and the Beautiful<em>, and was a close friend and collaborator of Helmut Newton.</em></p>
<p>“I still think about him everyday: his sense of humour, his elegance, his positiveness. A monument is not a good word for Helmut. But I wanted to do something for his memory [<em>The Bad and the Beautiful</em>] and he shouldn’t be forgotten, because now he’s on the verge of being forgotten a little bit. Our time is so fast and he died over ten years ago and would have turned 100 this year and that’s a good reason to look back. It was his brand to do those provocative photographs. It would never be possible today. So it’s history we’re talking about.</p>
<p>“What I didn’t know before I met him, looking at his photographs, was that he had so much respect for women. Strong women. He explained that once to me because he said that’s the most interesting: their strength and openness and they’re much stronger than men. This perspective of women was actually a revelation. The photographs tell that but you have to know what the background is. And then I think what I discovered and liked about him was his positive thinking: He never said that something is impossible. He was a very positive person. And that’s the secret behind his willingness and eagerness to go back to Berlin starting in the 60s, and then in the 70s, and then in the 80s and 90s he was often in Berlin.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2>Sascha Lilic</h2>
<p><em>Sascha Lilic is a London and Paris-based stylist who worked exclusively with Helmut Newton for over ten years.</em></p>
<p>“I used to be a hairdresser and a make-up artist. I was booked for a photoshoot by my agent in Strasbourg, France, early 90s. It was for this car [advertising campaign] and I only found out it was going to be with Helmut Newton when I got there. He was nothing I expected him to be in a way. He was an absolute gentleman and absolutely charming.</p>
<p>“We just started talking and we found out we had a lot of things in common: him being an immigrant and refugee leaving Germany and me being an immigrant and refugee having left the East Block (Yugoslavia). We clicked there and then and didn’t let go of each other until the day he died.</p>
<p>“I’ve learned everything about the industry that I know now through him. He had such a unique way of being. It was more about the humanity of it: how you deal with people on a photo shoot. He had a clear image in mind. On my side – doing the hair, the make-up and later the styling – it was creating that woman he had in mind and matching her into the story line. That got more and more intense through spending time together and then handling clients, models, editors or whoever there was on a shoot. It was extremely enlightening the way he did it. I have not seen this modus operandi with any other photographers so far. I ended up learning by doing and copying his [way of] being. It was sort of a father figure-ish thing because after ten years of being so close with somebody and so on top of each other, you exchange a lot of personal information and that helps you understand the person even more: the way he thinks and views things. To be able to handle people on a photoshoot without turning into an alcoholic or serial killer.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2>Sylvia Gobbel</h2>
<p><em>Sylvia Gobbel was one of Newton’s muses and appeared in one of his most iconic photos, </em>Sie Kommen (1981).</p>
<p>“He was very respectful as a man towards women. He loved strong women. He knew before myself that probably I was a strong woman. He admired women and always said women should rule the world, because they were stronger and wiser and never would make stupid decisions like men.</p>
<p>“He was a feminist. Even if feminists at that time in the 80s had another idea about Helmut because of his nudes. They misunderstood his work. Helmut Newton’s models were people who decided about themselves, their lives and their actions. Also June, his wife, was often on the set. He never took any decisions without her opinion.</p>
<p>“Helmut was certainly a perfectionist. He controlled the set, the styling, the hair, the make-up. He wanted to be sure everything would be as perfect as in his imagination. He told me the positions to take, where to look and I was lucky that I picked up his decisions immediately, because I understood what he meant. People think I’m still representing the ‘Helmut Newton woman’ and I’m flattered. Thanks to him, there will be something left of me on earth.</p>
<p>“My first photoshoot was the <em>Dressed and Naked</em> series for <em>French Vogue</em>, with special haute couture. So we immediately shot nudes together. Those nudes had nothing to do with seduction. They were here to show people that strong women are as strong dressed in haute couture as naked.</p>
<p>“We shared lots of laughter on set. I remember the AMICA campaign called <em>The Seven Deadly Sins.</em> We shot <em>Gluttony</em>. I had a kilo of caviar to lick for the picture. He stopped in the middle of the shoot and said laughing: ‘No, don’t eat it all! Leave some for me.’”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><strong>Ellen von Unwerth</strong></h2>
<p><em>Ellen von Unwerth is a German-born former model and prolific, boundary-pushing fashion photographer.</em></p>
<p>“Helmut Newton is for me definitely the most inspiring photographer of all times. His pictures show so much strength, provocation and humour, which is rare to find anywhere else.</p>
<p>“He used models to point out adventures of the bourgeois, the rich part of society and his own fantasies which were always a bit shocking but immensely intriguing. His light was not always the most flattering but the women looked strong, powerful, in control, and haunting.</p>
<p>“I worked with him only once as a model: it was not one of his best pictures. I didn’t even keep it. I guess I was not really his type, he liked curvy super women, while I was more like a skinny stick. But I was told that he loved my name: I guess that’s why he booked me in the first place.</p>
<p>“Later on when I started to be a photographer, I met him a couple of times and we talked together in German and had a good laugh. He also complimented me on my pictures which meant everything to me.</p>
<p>“I always think of him when I am at the Chateau Marmont hotel in Los Angeles where he took so many iconic pictures and left us with a crash. He was an amazing photographer which still makes me dream and keeps me on the lookout to see some of his exciting cliches happening in real life.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2>Cindy Crawford</h2>
<p><em>Cindy Crawford is one the core 90s supermodel and continues to work as a businesswoman and model. She’s the mother of model Kaia Gerber.</em></p>
<p>“As soon as I became aware of Helmut Newton’s work, I knew I wanted to shoot with him. I loved his strong and unapologetically sexual portrayal of women but with his unique underlying sense of humour. My first opportunity to work with him was in Monte Carlo for American <em>Vogue</em>. I was not disappointed: Our first shot was me in a white bathing suit and heels with a group of blindfolded musicians – so Helmut!</p>
<p>“What surprised me about working with him was how he used his photographs to tell some imagined story – and the story could keep evolving with each click of his camera. ‘You’re a widow.’ Click. ‘But he was rich.’ Click. ‘And you have a hot young lover.’ Click.</p>
<p>“He would capture each thought as it registered on your face. He was funny and raunchy and playful and his wife June was in on the joke. He was a dream to work with because he knew exactly what he wanted and was able to give specific directions to get it. For example, there’s a shot from the Monte Carlo shoot where I am walking down stairs. His direction was, ‘When you walk down the stairs, keep your stride long, with straight legs that are a little bit apart.’ That little bit of awkwardness gave the image an underlying sexuality. I feel so fortunate to have had the chance to learn from such a master even though I always teased him that he would never get a saddle on me!”</p>

<p>Raised on <em>The Sex Pistols</em>’ punk music and historically dividing his time between performing in rock bands, writing poetry and starring in every Japanese cult movie under the sun, the man they once called Japan’s Johnny Depp has few peers at home. Easily matching his American counterpart for off-kilter roles, <strong>Tadanobu Asano</strong> has popped up in underground hits by pretty much every big Japanese filmmaker of the past quarter-century. Behold:</p>
<p>Heartthrob husband in a meditative exploration of grief? See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0mDpUpIZ6Y"><em>Maborosi</em></a>, by Cannes Palme d’Or winner <a href="/design-living/12873/the-gentle-human-dramas-of-hirokazu-kore-eda-after-life-shoplifters">Hirokazu Kore-eda</a>.

Sword-wielding avenger in an ancient Japanese folk tale? That’s <a href="/design-living/12493/a-guide-to-shinya-tsukamoto-japan-cult-filmmaker-tetsuo-iron-man">Shinya Tsukamoto</a>’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xrEgNCHhFk"><em>Gemini</em></a>, which finally receives a UK release this November after a 20-odd year wait. The list goes on – because, in the past 25 years of Japanese cinema, there have been few actors as iconic as Asano, the go-to cool guy in every directors’ phone book.</p>
<p>With his small-screen presence bold enough to grant him a leg-up into Hollywood the 2010s, Asano can nowadays be found in all manner of Western hits. From a spirit-breaking interpreter in Martin Scorcese’s historical epic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqrgxZLd_gE"><em>Silence</em></a>, to <em>Thor's</em> ball-and-chain-wielding warrior buddy Hogun in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Asano’s steely detachment remains a constant allure. And since he’s now battled Keanu Reeves in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8cKdDkkIYY"><em>47 Ronin</em></a>, mentored Jared Leto in yakuza crime flick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNNcl2mEHzQ"><em>The Outsider</em></a>, and led an army as Genghis Khan in the Oscar-nominated epic <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miMYoTL5qlE">Mongol</a>, </em>it’s safe to say that Asano’s stature remains solid.</p>
<p>But before he made the jump, Asano was the king of the indies in Japan – and in a few other East Asian territories, for that matter. So here are five unforgettable turns to illustrate why, in a year starved of new cinematic splendours, a look at an Eastern small-screen sensation is long overdue.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaJBaMbYNt0"><em>Electric Dragon 80.000V</em></a>, 2001</h2>
<p>Directed by 80s arthouse pioneer Sogo Ishii (<em>Crazy Thunder Road, Burst City</em>), this 55-minute cyberpunk explosion pits Asano’s Dragon-Eye Morrison against the villainous Thunderbolt Buddha, in a comic book-style battle that threatens to destroy the whole of Tokyo. With each combatant wielding surging electricity as their weapon, the question is simple in this black-and-white caper: which shocker will emerge victorious?</p>
<p>Dragon-Eye Morrison is Asano’s amped-up hero in this super-stylised passion project, seen as director Ishii’s long-overdue return to the intense cyberpunk films he had pioneered in the 80s. Guerilla scenes of him riffing on a guitar in the middle of a busy pedestrian intersection were filmed without the public’s knowledge, and the hyper-kinetic editing is a feast for the eyes from start to finish. The searing, industrial soundtrack, meanwhile, was penned by Asano and Ishii’s explosive avant-garde punk band: <em>MACH-1.67.</em></p>
<p>Critically acclaimed upon release, <em>Electric Dragon 80.000V </em>actually bankrupted the production company behind it after it failed at the box office alongside Ishii and Asano’s other film that year: <em>Gojoe</em>. To be fair, you don’t get much more punk than that.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmHxzsbAZZc"><em>Ichi the Killer</em></a>, 2001</h2>
<p>Tadanobu Asano’s most memorable acting performance remains not only a career highlight but also one of the most iconic film roles in modern Japanese cinema. Adapted from a violent manga series by cult filmmaker Takashi Miike (<em>Audition, Thirteen Assassins</em>), <em>Ichi the Killer </em>follows Asano’s facially-mutilated yakuza enforcer Kakihara as he attempts to reap revenge on the man who murdered his gangland boss – hoping to meet a match for his own depraved brutality in the process.</p>
<p>Numerous scenes from<em> Ichi the Killer</em> remain censored in the UK due to their gratuitous violence, and much of the controversy is directly attributed to Asano’s sadistic lead. Kakihara’s methods of torture include fish hooks, tempura oil, and razor-sharp skewers; but it is his larger-than-life presence (and outrageous appearance) that makes him such an enduring cult character. </p>
<p>With a wardrobe that combines sequinned shirts, tartan slacks, mauve trenchcoats and velvet suits, this peroxide blonde, chelsea-smiling mobster is a constantly electrifying presence in a film pulsating with style and menace. A villain for Japan’s all-time-greatest rogue’s gallery – it is a role Asano was born to play.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6ov1-dJXAk"><em>Zatoichi</em></a>, 2003</h2>
<p>Zatoichi, the blind swordsman, is to Japanese cinema what James Bond is to Britain: a home-grown film icon whose antics span a wildly uneven range of theatrical releases. </p>
<p>By the time crime auteur <a href="/design-living/12671/must-watch-crime-films-by-takeshi-kitano-japan-season-bfi">Takeshi Kitano</a> made his move to write, direct and star in this turn-of-the-century franchise revival, the character had already been the focus of 26 feature films, four TV series’ and an American remake starring Rutger Hauer. But Kitano’s epic, <em>Kill Bill-</em>style samurai-action-musical hybrid would be the toast of them all. It won the Silver Lion for Best Director at Venice 2003, grossing a massive $24 million at the Japanese box office.</p>
<p>The director made no bones about his intentions for <em>Zatoichi –</em> after a series of commercially unsuccessful works, Kitano wanted nothing more than to make a blockbuster. And part of this process was to cast fast-rising actor Asano in a pivotal role: masterless samurai Hattori, the blind swordman’s nemesis in a town of feuding gangs in Edo-era Japan. </p>
<p>Asano’s detached aura would be a perfect fit for the jaded bodyguard-for-hire. And for his stoic performance, Asano received a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the 2004 Japanese Academy Awards.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NcBL6cYGL4"><em>The Taste of Tea</em></a>, 2004</h2>
<p>This absurd comedy is rightfully considered Japanese filmmaker Katsuhito Ishii’s answer to Wes Anderson’s <em>The Royal Tenenbaums. </em>Starring Asano (who previously starred the director’s Tarantino-inspired <em>Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl </em>in 1999) alongside a host of captivating character actors as members of the eccentric Haruno family, <em>The Taste of Tea</em> finally received a UK Blu-ray release courtesy of Third Window Films this October – and it’s worth the wait.</p>
<p>As six-year-old daydreamer Sachiko strives to escape her giant imaginary doppelganger, senile grandpa Akira breaks into song and dance at the drop of a hat. But despite their quirky personalities, Asano’s lazy music producer uncle Ayano easily gives them a run for their money for most memorable character in this vibrant countryside fantasy-drama.</p>
<p>Introduced by way of an extended vignette, in which he details the story of the first time he ever took a shit in the woods, Ayano soon finds himself involved in a number of eventful encounters across the film’s meandering narrative. Be it an awkward rendezvous with an old flame in front of a convenience store, or a bizarre recording session with a pretentious animator, Asano’s languid performance elevates Ayano into an offbeat slacker who is funny right to the end.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKVunsvz824"><em>Ruined Heart: Another Love Story Between a Criminal  a Whore</em></a>, 2014</strong></h2>
<p>In 2017, Asano took home the Best Actor Award at the Asian Film Awards for Kōji Fukada’s <em>Harmonium</em>, a Cannes Jury Prize-winner the year of its release. His role as a murderer released from prison, who oversteps boundaries as he attempts to reintegrate into society, fit the coolly detached performer as much as anything he’d done prior. But just a few years earlier, Asano’s role in a lesser-known indie flick from the Philippines harked back to the days before he’d hit the big time. <em>Ruined Heart</em> was a return to Asano’s roots – even if it wasn’t filmed in his home country.</p>
<p>A kinetic, vibrantly colourful and largely dialogue-free crime romp set in the back alleys of Manila, <em>Ruined Heart </em>is built upon its riveting sense of style. It follows Asano’s nameless, broken-armed criminal on a series of wild exploits with his prostitute lover – and though the story is paper-thin, this tour-de-force of filmmaking verve should, by rights, put Filipino arthouse cinema on the map.</p>
<p>Shot in documentary style by legendary cinematographer Christopher Doyle (<em>In The Mood For Love</em>, <em>2046</em>), and featuring a wild soundtrack that comprises surf, blues and krautrock, <em>Ruined Heart </em>almost feels like a 70-minute music video. It’s stock full of gratuitous long-takes and dizzying foot-chases, but for all its creative ambition, it is Asano who is the film’s magnetic heart that keeps everything beating. </p>
<p>Whether he’s manically playing the drums in a midnight street party or sloshed out in the basement of a seedy underground bar – this chain-smoking, pistol-wielding tearaway is Asano distilled to the core. <em>Ruined Heart, </em>ultimately<em>, </em>is a latter-day reminder of why Asano’s unique, effortless cool continues to transcend borders and boundaries to this day.</p>]]>

<p>“I’m afraid of getting bored,” said <a href="/tag/gucci"><strong>Gucci</strong></a>’s <a href="/tag/alessandro-michele">Alessandro Michele</a> in the wake of his <a href="/fashion-beauty/11948/gucci-alessandro-michele-spring-summer-2020-ss20-milan-mfw">Spring/Summer 2020</a> show. “I always have to try something new.” This sentiment is undoubtedly the driving force behind Michele’s collections for Gucci, which have continued to surprise and delight since he took over as creative director in 2015. Gucci’s latest project, revealed today, is no different: a tongue-in-cheek campaign photographed by American photographer <a href="/search?q=alec+soth"><strong>Alec Soth</strong></a>, which purposefully shatters the glamorous illusion of a fashion shoot.</p>
<p>Shot in two starkly different locations in Rome – the historic late-Mannerist Palazzo Sacchetti and the distressed, graffiti-covered Campo Boario area – Soth’s images capture an orchestrated chaos of Gucci-adorned models, who are in-house designers for the brand, and animals alongside real-life production crew members, who manoeuvre props and camera equipment in plain clothes and masks. Best known for his compelling documentary photography of “loners and dreamers” in America’s midwest, <em>New York Times</em> art critic Hilarie M. Sheets once wrote that Soth made a “photographic career out of finding chemistry with strangers”. Such chemistry is evident in these playful images for Gucci, which capture the “messy beauty” behind a campaign for the Italian house.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Entitled <em>The Epilogue</em>, the campaign is a visual counterpart to Michele’s <a href="/fashion-beauty/12691/gucci-alessandro-michele-ss21-epilogue-show-lookbook-film">July collection</a> of the same name, which marked the “final act” of a three-part collection beginning with Autumn/Winter 2020, <em>An Unrepeatable Ritual</em>, which inverted the fashion show, taking the audience backstage. This trilogy is, according to Gucci, an exercise in revealing “the magic of fashion by unveiling what lies behind the curtains of a beloved liturgy.” The July offering was revealed via a live-stream presentation as well as a short film by video artist Akinola Davies, plus a series of Mark Peckmezian-shot images, all of which also starred the talented team of creatives who make up Gucci’s design workforce.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="OsQw_HTP2_I"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OsQw_HTP2_I" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>“I brought together different things, which represent the messy beauty that I have always sought: the chaos of beauty,” said Michele in a statement. “Breaking the spell that forces my collaborators to passionately work on clothes they later have to abandon, I asked the team to wear them. And so we did a self-sufficient job, all inside our house, mixing things we had already done with things we were about to – overcoming the schemes of the time coherently with my idea of <em>The Epilogue</em>, the final resolution of a future that is largely present.”</p><p><em>Creative director: Alessandro Michele.

<p>“Gender-based discrimination, oppression and violence take many different forms,” says Eli. “Having a global perspective is essential to the mission of Chime for Change and <em>The Chime Zine</em>. Therefore it is important we cast an extremely wide net. In this issue we talk about women with disabilities, trans dating, TERFism, Black queer womanhood, the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women, female genital mutilation, child marriage and more. On the surface these issues may appear unrelated but they are all about gender inequality. The zine is an exercise in intersectionality; by literally binding these issues together we show that their causes and solutions all intersect.”</p>
<p>Art directed by Eli’s creative partner, MP5, the publication features an essay on Lady Phyll by Tanya Compas, a graphic narrative exploring civil war, refugees, gender and sexuality by Lena Merhej, and a photo representation from NeuroSpeculative AfroFeminism (NSAF), an Afrofuturist narrative from Hyphen-Labs, an international art/tech collective of women of colour, as well as an entire section devoted to Japan, and much more.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>While Eli is hesitant to name a highlight, he does express his love for Merhej’s graphic narrative – a “sinister” maze which reflects the refugee crisis. “The maze begins with two queer women in love escaping a war, prejudice or natural disaster to a place where they can love freely,” he says. “Along the way they ‘encounter psychological, physical and sexual abuse … administered two fold for their being women and gay’. The maze is riddled with obstacles fleeing refugees often face – militias, chemical weapons, gunmen, terrorising police, poverty, rape, an unsafe voyage across the Mediterranean Sea, detention camps and more.”</p>
<p>Eli himself is a community organiser and writer based in New York City. Listed in the <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/projects/article/39721/1/adam-eli-voices4-activist-biography-dazed-100-2018-profile">2018 Dazed 100</a> and even featured on the <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/politics/article/40340/1/ryan-mcginley-gun-control-activism-america">cover of the summer 2018 issue of Dazed</a>, alongside other anti-gun activists, Eli is the founder of international activist group <a href="https://www.instagram.com/voices4_/?hl=en">Voices4</a>, releasing his debut book,<em> <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609484/the-new-queer-conscience-by-adam-eli-illustrated-by-ashley-lukashevsky/">The New Queer Conscience</a>,</em> earlier this summer.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Eli’s own entry into activism came via his upbringing, specifically his Jewish faith. “I grew up in a deeply Jewish household and my parents placed a huge emphasis on the Jewish principle ‘Tikkun Olam’ which literally translates to ‘heal or mend the world’,” he says. “Essentially we were taught that being part of the Jewish people, a traditionally marginalised group, we had an obligation to show up for other marginalised peoples. My work within the queer space was activated by the Pulse Orlando massacre.”</p>
<p>Now editor-in-chief of <em>The Chime Zine</em>, in addition to his other work, Eli says the publication is about “creating and fostering a network of people fighting for gender equality across the world”. “It is our dream that the zine be used as a tool to inspire and connect those who are looking to become involved in the fight for gender equality,” he says.</p>

<p>Three years ago, Matheus Lomonte was a relatively unknown fashion student. But his Instagram account, <strong><a href="https://www.instagram.com/moonriverchacha/">@moonriverchacha</a></strong>, attracted the attention of <a href="/tag/marni">Marni</a>’s Francesco Risso, and Lomonte soon found himself on the moodboard for the brand’s S/S18 collection. Today, the 30-year-old creative also counts <a href="/tag/marc-jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a> among his followers (and fans) – and, with a quick scroll through his feed which showcases an off-beat sense of dress through artfully composed selfies and portraits, it’s not difficult to see why the designers are looking to him for inspiration. “I always liked taking pictures of myself and Instagram allows me to show off my style,” Lomonte tells AnOther over email. “I see my account as a scrapbook. I’ve made really good friends there, too,” he continues, citing <a href="https://www.instagram.com/momoochoo/">@momoochoo</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michelle_elie/">@michelle_elie</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/themarcjacobs/">@themarcjacobs</a> as some of the accounts that he most admires.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Growing up in Minas Gerais, Brazil between the city and his family farm, Lomonte spent his youth playing with dolls and chickens, and riding horses. “Since I was a child, being connected to nature has been important to me,” he explains. After graduating high school, Lomonte began studying law, but found that it stifled him and quickly dropped out. “I have so many bad memories of it. I was under the influence of my family, living in a closet,” he says. “So I stopped abruptly and started my fashion studies.” But the structure of fashion school didn’t quite suit his temperament either. “It was at a really boring college. It took me more years than usual to graduate because it was so frustrating. I interrupted the process a lot of times ... I didn’t fit in. I believe I have learned more from movies, books, the art world, and life in general, than from a classroom.”</p>
<p>Certainly, this eclectic education shines through in Lomonte’s posts to @moonriverchacha, and in the way he puts clothes together. “I find it very difficult to catalogue anything about myself. I don’t like to be categorised as anything too specific and I put on my looks very instinctively,” he says. However, to attempt to put it into words, his aesthetic consists of thick curly dark hair and bushy brows, offset with what could be described as an ode to the Kinderwhore look of the 1990s. Think: polka dot Peter Pan collars; frumpy hand-knitted cardigans in pastel shades; pussybow blouses; plastic hair slides; secretarial eyewear; patent Mary Jane shoes and frilly white socks. He also polishes up his looks through a touch of Italian-inspired glamour, with pieces that might have been worn by Monica Vitti as the lead in a Michelangelo Antonioni film.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>Lomonte’s style icons happen to be Italian, too, with Anna Piaggi and <a href="/tag/miuccia-prada">Miuccia Prada</a> pinned to the top of his moodboard. “I just love <a href="/tag/miu-miu">Miu Miu</a>,” he says. “My girly side screams with joy every season.” Lomonte also sources most of his clothes and jewellery from his mother’s wardrobe and works creatively with his boyfriend of 12 years, Pedro Macedo, who makes pieces for him to wear. “I met Pedro through some mutual friends,” he explains. “I gave him his first gay kiss and we have been together ever since. We have a really good connection. We share the same interests and that makes it super easy to work together. We are always creating, making plans, and projects together. He also takes a lot of my pictures as well as making clothes for me. I’m so blessed to have him by my side.” Their latest work together can be seen illustrating this article: a series of portraits shot by Macedo, with Lomonte posing on a roadside, either clutching a fur coat, wearing a sock as a glove, or with bare feet that have been painted silver.</p>
<p>Social media has long been recognised as an artistic medium in itself, and during a global lockdown, its role as a vital tool for self-expression has become even more apparent. This rings particularly true for Lomonte, as Instagram has afforded him a place to keep dressing up – and being seen – in his beautifully bizarre ensembles. “In actual fact, I’m spending most of my time in pyjamas,” he says. “I really miss getting dressed up to go out.” Lomonte’s plans for the future are as uncertain as anyone’s right now – but he’s staying positive. “’I’m trying to live a day by day. It’s less frustrating that way. But of course I still have dreams to work with more people that I admire and who inspire me.”</p>]]>

<p>“My world of scent, my universe of perfume, is rich. It keeps me connected with so many things: memories, the past, the thoughts they have prompted. Another world,” <a href="/tag/alessandro-michele">Alessandro Michele</a> <a href="/fashion-beauty/12793/susie-cave-dresses-house-gucci-bloom-alasdair-mclellan-alessandro-michele">told</a> AnOther Magazine for the <a href="/tag/another-magazine-autumnwinter-2020">Autumn/Winter 2020 issue</a>. Here, Michele described the inception of his latest <strong>Gucci Bloom</strong> fragrance, <a href="https://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/gucci-bloom-profumo-di-fiori-eau-de-parfum_R03657329/">Profumo di Fiori</a> – meaning ‘scent of flowers’ – the first perfume he has developed in its entirety, with the help of master perfumer Alberto Morillas. As such it’s an ebullient olfactory time machine.</p>
<p>While the accompanying Gucci Bloom campaign is a psychedelic blur of magnificent women – actor and director Anjelica Houston, model and designer <a href="/fashion-beauty/12793/susie-cave-dresses-house-gucci-bloom-alasdair-mclellan-alessandro-michele">Susie Cave</a>, actor Jodie Turner-Smith and musician Florence Welch – tripping in an almost demonically magical garden, the perfume conjures something a little more buttoned-up. Here, Michele piled classic floral ingredients – heady tuberose, rich jasmine, orris and ylang ylang – onto woody base notes of sandalwood and resinous benzoin, the effect of which is a rich, antique polish. Heavy and cool, like the stone-clad floors of an old basilica, this opaque scent calls to mind the pungent jars of a Florentine apothecary: hallowed shelves filled with cinders of iris root and nuggets of amber. It is a near-holy paean to the art of perfumery. </p>
<p>“I love strong scents, the smells of nature, the fragrance of flowers,” Michele says. “For some time these types of scents fell out of fashion, but I adore them, as I adore all the things that are no longer in fashion. Because the things that were once in fashion hide a meaning. I was intrigued by the perfume of tuberose – it became the starting point for me, for Gucci Bloom. Tuberoses were the flowers that reminded me of times I would walk with my mother in the afternoons.” Profumo di Fiori is, of course, unashamedly floral – like the iridescent jacquards on Michele’s boxy handbags and synonymous shearling-lined loafers, like the Toile de Jouy Herbarium House print of leaves, cherry branches and flowers that cover the fragrance’s honey-coloured box and has become the Italian fashion house's signature élan, cladding the walls of Gucci stores, and the plates in the Gucci Garden restaurant. Unashamed may be the watchword for this scent, so bold is its evocation of florals.</p>

<p>“They are your children. It is your tax dollars. It is your library. You are entitled to know,” reads an ominous warning on the homepage of The Library Patrons of Texas. The function of this now defunct website was clear — it acted as an organising point for conservative parents who were horrified at the morally-degrading material being distributed by local libraries throughout the US. Concerned citizens were given the opportunity to review extracts from the offending books, before being invited to submit angry letters of complaint to local officials demanding that the titles be pulled from shelves. To access an online list of the books in question, visitors had to sign an age-verified declaration which acknowledged that some of the stories they were about to read contained “profanity, explicit sexual content and graphic violence,” and that The Library Patrons of Texas was not liable “for any damages of any kind resulting from viewing or any other use of this material.” What would happen to these books once they’d been removed from shelves was left unspecified. Perhaps they’d be burned? It didn’t matter, the crucial thing was that juveniles and young adults not be allowed to read them.</p>
<p>One book that had the misfortune to make it onto the Patrons’ list was Aidan Chambers’ 1982 novel <em>Dance on My Grave</em>. Ever since its publication, organisations like The Library Patrons of Texas had been lobbying for it to be banned. Chambers’ crime? Writing a non-judgemental queer teen romance. Told through the voice of the 16-year-old Hal, <em>Dance on My Grave</em> celebrates the flush of first love as something completely normal, irrespective of the fact the courtship happens to be between two boys. “That the characters were gay was not an issue,” says three-time Palme d’Or nominee François Ozon, “And in the 80s that was … I won’t say revolutionary, but it was very strong.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402977.jpeg" alt="ETE_85_Photo_2#169;2020_MANDARIN PRODUCTION_FOZ_France" />        <figcaption>

<p>Ozon was 17 when he first read Chambers’ story. He’d heard the book being eagerly discussed, but hadn’t had a chance to get his hands on a copy until he was bought one by an older friend. “It was full of pleasure,” says the director, “It made it seem very simple to be in love with another boy.” An avid follower of film from an early age, most of the stories about gay life that Ozon had come into contact with predicted a bleak future for the young cinephile. Patrice Chéreau’s <em>L'Homme Blessé</em>, Julian Mitchell’s <em>Another Country</em>, William Friedkin’s <em>Cruising</em>, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s <em>Querelle</em> – all warned of the harassment, blackmail, assault and death that seemed, inevitably, to await older gay men. “Gay stories at the time were full of guilt,” says Ozon, “It was very dark all the time.”</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he’d finished reading <em>Dance on My Grave</em>, the young Ozon began working on a script. Though he’s no idea where that early draft is now, he remembers the changes he made to Chambers’ novel. “I cut the teacher,” he says, “I cut the social worker. The parents weren’t important. I was focused only on the love story.” It would have made for terrible viewing, he suspects. After his initial frenzy of interest, it would be another 35 years before Ozon sat down to re-read the book he’d loved as a teen. After finishing <em>By the Grace of God</em> – “A very heavy, a very dark movie,” he says – he wanted to explore something lighter, something youthful. “I found this book in my library,” he remembers, “And I thought it’s perfect. It’s exactly what I want. Films happen when they need to happen. It was the right moment at the right place.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="9Tv1viaO_NQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Tv1viaO_NQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong><a href="https://www.curzonartificialeye.com/summer-of-85/"><em>Summer of 85</em></a></strong> is remarkably faithful to Chambers’ original novel. A few details have changed here and there – Ozon relocated the story to Normandy, altered a few of the characters’ names, their nationalities – but what remains is a remarkably sensual, sophisticated and indulgent story about two young men falling in love for the first time. Soundtracked with 80s rock gems from Ozon’s teenage years, <em>Summer of 85</em> revels wistfully in the everyday dramas of adolescence. “You’re experiencing the point of view of Alexi [formerly Hal],” says Ozon, “You live with him, you share his emotions. It’s very naive and innocent. My goal was to make a film for the teenager I was. I wanted to see this kind of movie when I was 17.”</p>
<p>As for what he hopes today’s audiences will take away from the film, “I want people to take pleasure from it,” he says. “The film is an opportunity to think about yourself, to think about your life, about your love, about your purpose … But mostly I just want people to enjoy this story as much as I did when I first discovered it.”</p>

<p>During the summer of 1952, a rising commercial illustrator named <strong>Andy Warhol</strong> was preparing to make his debut on the New York art scene. He had been working on a series of elegant line drawings celebrating queer love – a style and subject that couldn’t be less fitting to the American audience. Enthralled by hypermasculine ideals and Abstract Expressionist aesthetics, galleries balked at Warhol’s efforts to show his work but the then 24-year-old artist would not be denied.</p>
<p>“Throughout his life, Warhol refused to be defined by social conventions,” says Michael Dayton Hermann, editor of <a href="https://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/art/all/05345/facts.andy_warhol_love_sex_and_desire_drawings_19501962.htm?utm_source=RakutenMarketingutm_medium=Affiliateutm_campaign=2116208:Skimlinks.comutm_content=10utm_term=UKNetworkranMID=42784ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNwranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-8eaRu9M2lsoCW0MzJILqnQ"><em>Andy Warhol. Love, Sex, and Desire. Drawings 1950–1962</em></a> (Taschen, November 2020). “John Giorno, artist, poet and Warhol’s former lover, explained, ‘Andy was a gay man and worked with the homoerotic. In the homophobic 1950s, this was daring and heroic. A great risk.’”</p>
<p>The book brings together over 300 drawings rendered primarily in ink on paper of men reveling in the pleasure of youth, beauty, and the flesh. Their defining characteristic is a palpable sense of unbridled sexuality, one made all the more alluring by its defiance against societal norms. At a time when homosexuality was illegal and full-frontal male nudity was considered “obscene,” simply looking at the male body was an act of liberation, defiance, and pure delight.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>In the essay <em>Warhol’s Defiant Hopes for Queer Art</em>, art critic Blake Gopnik recounts, “Endless stories have come down to us about the overheated drawing sessions that provided Warhol’s subject matter. ‘Andy had this great passion for drawing people’s cocks and he had pads and pads and pads of drawings of people’s lower regions,’ said a queer friend and assistant of Warhol’s … ‘Every time he got to know somebody, even as a friend sometimes, he’d say, ‘Let me draw your cock.’ … They’d drop their pants, and Andy would make a drawing. That was it. And then he’d say, ‘Thank you.’”</p>
<p>Warhol knew exactly what he wanted and his drawings said it all. “Warhol’s drawings of men depict a spectrum of intimacy from a yearning gaze to a loving embrace to fellatio,” Hermann says. “That these works were created by a practicing Catholic in the United States at a time when sodomy was a harshly punished felony in every state illustrates that, even at a young age, Warhol embraced the role of the nonconformist.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, Warhol decided to first shows these works on Valentine’s Day in 1956, presenting them at the Bodley Gallery on New York’s Upper East Side. “Warhol wasn’t looking to ingratiate himself into powerful social circles by publicly countering ideas of sexuality acceptable at that time,” Hermann says.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402970.jpg" alt="Andy Warhol. Love, Sex, and Desire. Drawings 1950–1962" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>“Instead, Warhol seemed intent on expanding the circumference of those elite groups to be more inclusive of marginalised people like himself. As Warhol said about his storied studio, the Factory, which brought people together regardless of their social status or sexuality, ‘People weren’t particularly interested in seeing me, they were interested in seeing each other.’”</p>
<p>Although Warhol kept his romantic relationships relatively private, he used art to express his queer identity throughout his career. In doing so, these drawings may reveal more than his self-portraits ever did.</p>
<p>“The early drawings featured in <em>Andy Warhol Love, Sex, and Desire </em>uniquely showcase Warhol’s own hand and reveal an artist who subsequently crafted an impenetrable public image for himself,” Hermann says. “Collectively, the hundreds of drawings Warhol made from life during this period provide a touching portrait of the one person not depicted in any of them – Andy Warhol.”</p>

<p>For fans of <a href="/tag/raf-simons"><strong>Raf Simons</strong></a>, several news items from the Belgian designer’s camp have sparked joy in a year otherwise marked by doom and gloom. The first came in March, prompting mild hysteria, that Simons and Miuccia Prada would be joining forces as co-creative directors of Prada (the pair revealed their first joint collection last month via a live-streamed runway show). Then, in July, Simons released his <a href="/another-man/12664/raf-simons-redux-re-releasing-his-most-memorable-pieces-archive">Redux collection</a>, giving younger fans the opportunity to buy replicas of 100 seminal pieces from his sought-after archive; and, perhaps most exciting of all – for his female fans at least – last month, he revealed that he would be launching his first-ever womenswear collection under his eponymous label.</p>
<p>Taking place in Antwerp later today, the show coincides with the 25th anniversary of Simons’ brand. Initially trained in industrial design, Simons saw something in 1991 which would alter the course of his life forever: Martin Margiela’s iconic all-white show. “Until then, I still saw fashion as something quite bubbly, not about dialogue or conversation,” he said many years later. “Martin’s show had such an amazing level of emotion and concept. I was crying. A lot of people there were crying … It was like seeing an artwork.’” So moved by this show, Simons’ decided to found his own eponymous label in 1995 and, in the years since, his imaginative and expansive approach to fashion has altered the remit of what menswear can be, bringing it from the sidelines into the fore. With an innate knowledge of subculture and admiration for boldness and pain of youth, Simons’ clothing has, from the start, been imbued with the complexities of masculinity and beauty, life and love. Melding the codes and psyches of different youth cultures – from English schoolboys to Kraftwerk, New Wave and punk – with a romantic obsession with the future, Simons has attracted a dedicated cult following few designers can rival, producing collections which command an emotional pull not dissimilar to his hero, Margiela.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Such an intuitive approach to design has seen the designer soar to success at helm of some fashion’s most prestigious brands, where he has approached womenswear with the same imagination and emotion – from minimalist hero Jil Sander to the historic halls of Dior, American juggernaut Calvin Klein, and now of course at Prada. “For me, there is nothing more satisfying than a woman coming to me and telling me she feels beautiful in my clothes,” Simons told AnOther in 2013. “Isn’t that what most designers aim for? Isn’t that what most designers dream of?” Here, ahead his Spring/Summer 2021 show, a selection of Simons’ most illuminating soundbites on fashion.</p>
<ol>
<li>“I don’t want to show clothes, I want to show my attitude, my past, present and future. I use memories and future visions and try to place them in today’s world.”</li>
<li>“I was really out to find an audience, no matter how small, who could feel, ‘This is something I could connect with, something I feel like I can be part of.’”</li>
<li>“I’m not so rock and roll. I’m more techno.”</li>
<li>“In the 90s, it was common to see people who expressed themselves through one designer – the Jil Sander woman, the Martin Margiela woman. You saw her on the street, and you knew who she was.”</li>
<li>“The future, for me, is romantic, I don’t understand people who say the past is romantic. Romantic, for me, is something you don’t know yet, something you can dream about, something unknown and mystical.”</li>
<li>“There is always a Martin reference. Hidden or not hidden.”</li>
<li>“What gives me enormous satisfaction is that we have an incredible following from a young crowd … I don’t know if it is because I understand them or because they understand me. I have always thought – and will never change my mind – that children and kids, youth, are our future. That’s by definition the case, so that’s also why it’s important to pay attention.” </li>
<li>“Raf Simons is seen as something that is dark, gothic, niche, but I’ve never been interested in just one thing.”</li>
<li>“The fashion world doesn’t know the word stop, so you have to make sure there are sublime moments every day.”</li>
<li>“To me, it’s the designer’s responsibility to persuade people to look at other things, to propose what might interest people in the future.”</li>

      <![CDATA[






<p>During the bewildering period of lockdown, London-based design duo Emma Chopova and Laura Lowena began thinking about community and how they could feel connected to others from home. Calling on a host of gifted young creatives from across the city, the designers invited “makers, artists and artisans” they admire – from jewellery designer <a href="/fashion-beauty/12195/georgia-kemball-is-making-mystical-jewellery-with-protective-properties">Georgia Kemball</a> to artist <a href="/art-photography/12018/faye-wei-weis-paintings-ive-always-been-a-weeper-at-the-cinema">Faye Wei Wei</a> – to contribute to their joyful Spring/Summer 2021 outing, which is inspired by traditional Romanian dress and roller derby. The resulting collection is one of bright, off-beat beauty, which marries the eclectic creative fruits of these artists with <a href="/search?q=chopova+lowena"><strong>Chopova Lowena</strong></a>’s idiosyncratic style – bold prints, pleats, and fabrics sourced from Chopova’s native Bulgaria – together presenting a loving celebration of the designers’ collaborative world. “Fashion has the power to create groups where you really feel like you belong and you are part of something with like minded people,” the designers tell AnOther over email. “That’s one of the things that drew us together.” </p>
<p>The duo have extended this community spirit to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChSkDgKfOWFJ4M2_4GkREGA/">new film project</a>, which, offering a rare insight into the making of a collection, captures their coterie of S/S21 collaborators at home. Among them, Kemball and Wei Wei, in addition to Ami Evelyn Hughes, Rhea Dillon and Jewel Yang, who also all starred in the brand’s ad-hoc iPhone-shot look book – presented as part of digital London Fashion Week, and styled by AnOther’s senior fashion editor-at-large Agata Belcen – alongside friends of the brand and their interns. “We found it important to collaborate with artists and makers who would be involved in making products, but also some who wouldn’t,” the designers explain. “All of these artistic processes are sacred and personal, and we wanted to show how much goes into making everything, how luxurious and authentic everything behind the scenes is.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>The home videos invite you into the private creative worlds of these young artists, in turn revealing immense detail which went into making the collection. In them, we see Kemball craft charms inspired by British and Bulgarian relics; Hughes collage Bulgarian postcards (for fabric prints), and Faye Wei Wei hypnotically swirl marbled prints inspired by her romantic paintings, which were later recreated by artisans in Turkey. The latest two instalments in the series, premiered here on AnOthermag.com, star artists Rhea Dillon and Jewel Yang, in which the former recites a beautiful poem from her studio – dressed in full Chopova regalia – and the latter executes an avant-garde make-up look. “Jewel, we followed on Instagram and just loved the make-up looks which she creates, the precision and colour and design of them is so alluring,” the designers say. “Rhea went to Saint Martins around the same time we did and we have always really loved her videos … Her words are powerful while the video is such a captivating look into her space and where she creates art, a glimpse into her mind.”</p>
<p>While the series is a celebration of Chopova Lowena’s creative community, it is equally a love letter to craft, something which is at the heart of each piece produced by the two designers. “We have a real desire to showcase all of the process it takes to create something special or well designed,” the duo explains. “The most rewarding, and what we are most proud of, is that we have created an amazing community of people in the production of skirts,” they continue. “Everything from the sourcing which involves dealing with people all over the country ... to then pleating which is done by hand, but finally, and most importantly, our factory run by a very strong and amazing woman.” This season, their unique, painstakingly crafted pieces felt more dear to the designers than ever. “At a time like this, people really are craving something special and something which brings a bit of escapism and storytelling to their wardrobe.”</p>

<p><a href="/tag/helmut-newton"><strong>Helmut Newton</strong></a> would have turned 100 this month, so a new documentary celebrating his life and work arrives with impeccably poignant timing. Directed by journalist and filmmaker Gero von Boehm, a friend of the late provocateur and his widow June, <em>Helmut Newton: The Bad and the Beautiful</em> doesn’t offer an impartial analysis of the man who was often described as photography’s “enfant terrible” and sometimes “the king of kink”. The only substantive criticism of the somewhat fetishistic way Newton depicted women in photographs for <em>Vogue</em>, <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em> and other publications comes from an archive clip in which feminist icon Susan Sontag tells Newton she dislikes his work. There’s little doubt the “bad” in this film’s title means “a little bit naughty” as opposed to anything actively malignant.</p>
<p>Still, this bias doesn’t stop Von Boehm’s film feeling insightful – far from it. The director’s affection for his subject is palpable and seems to provoke candour from Newton in fly-on-the-wall footage shot several years before his death on January 23, 2004. “I must say I miss him very much every day,” Von Boehm says touchingly when I interview him over Zoom shortly before the documentary’s UK release.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>A mix of affection and reverence for the photographer is also a recurring theme in Von Boehm’s fascinating new talking-head interviews with some of the prominent women he shot. Charlotte Rampling, Claudia Schiffer, Isabella Rossellini, Marianne Faithfull and others pay tribute to his greatness as a photographer and playfulness as a collaborator. When Grace Jones describes Newton as “a little bit perverse”, she immediately qualifies this observation by saying: “But so am I, so it’s OK.” <em>Vogue</em>’s Anna Wintour says she used his photographs as “a stopper” in her magazines because she knew they’d be powerful enough to stop readers from idly flicking through the pages.</p>
<p><em>Helmut Newton: The Bad and the Beautiful</em>’s all-female cast list is very much by design. “Why did I pick ten women? Because there were almost no statements from women about Helmut,” Von Boehm says matter-of-factly. “There were many brilliant scholarly essays by male journalists, male gallerists and male curators – and there were some anecdotes from [female] assistants he’d worked with – but I’d rarely heard women speak or write about him. So I thought: ‘Why not give carte blanche to women who really knew him well and had worked with him?’”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Though Von Boehm was adamant he wanted to speak to “Newton’s women”, he admits he didn’t know what to expect. “I was really interested in what they would say about him and his photography because they and their bodies were the subjects,” he says. “I did think: ‘Would they see themselves as objects?’” But in fact, Von Boehm says he was “astonished” by the details they recalled and says many viewed their Newton shoots as a career milestone. Citing Newton’s <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artwork/helmut-newton-charlotte-rampling-at-hotel-du-nord">iconic nude photograph of Rampling</a> taken at Paris’s Hotel Du Nord  in 1973, Von Boehm says: “It was the beginning of something big for both of them and Charlotte told me this photo gave her a feeling of immense power. She said her whole career would have gone differently without this one photo. And Marianne Faithfull and Grace Jones told me similar things.”</p>
<p>Though Newton’s unapologetically erotic images were always controversial – Sontag calls him a “misogynist” who “humiliates women” – the photographer was bold enough in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/may/05/weekend.lindsaybaker">2001 interview</a> to claim he is a “feminist”. Does Von Boehm agree? “There’s something completely right about it because at least he wanted to show us how strong women are,” the director says. He then cites Newton’s famous diptych <a href="https://loeildelaphotographie.com/en/sothebys-helmut-newton-diptych-sold-670000-2/"><em>Sie Kommen (Dressed)  Sie Kommen (Naked)</em></a>, in which he presents four women dressed in high-fashion outfits next to the same four women wearing nothing at all. “What does the photo tell us?” Von Boehm asks rhetorically. “That strong women are strong women even without haute couture – they don’t need it. And this is, if you will, a kind of feminism.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="aWJtnEmMW8c"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWJtnEmMW8c" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>Whatever your take on Newton’s work, there’s no denying that Von Boehm’s film captures the photographer’s impish personality. It also shows his loving relationship with his wife June, a talented photographer in her own right who uses the professional pseudonym Alice Springs. And crucially, Von Boehm doesn’t shy away from exploring how Newton, a Jewish boy who grew up in Nazi Germany, was influenced by Leni Riefenstahl’s photographic propaganda depicting athletic Aryan bodies as an aspirational ideal.</p>
<p>When I suggest that the way Newton died in 2004 age 83 was strangely poetic, Von Boehm agrees. “His death was tragic but also fitted into his whole story. He was at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood and he was on his way to shoot some beautiful girls on the beach at Santa Monica when he had a heart attack at the wheel,” he says. “But I do think if he hadn’t died, he could have gone on working for many more years to come. Helmut definitely wasn’t finished yet.”</p>

<p><strong>Campbell Addy</strong> is one of Britain’s most celebrated emerging image- and filmmakers. Bursting onto the scene in 2016, the Central Saint Martins graduate’s work is characterised by its emotionality, as well as its focus on interesting and under-represented faces – something that came through in both his publication <em>Nii Journal</em> and modelling agency Nii Agency, also launched that year.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years and Addy is represented by CLM, one of the most prestigious artist managements, and has undertaken commissions for Dazed, <em>i-D</em>, <em>Vogue</em>, and more, capturing the likes of Debra Shaw, Adut Akech, Naomi Campbell, among others, and most recently drawing attention for his portrait of Edward Enninful, which appeared on the cover of <em>Time</em>.</p>
<p>Here, Addy presents a new series, specially commissioned by AnOther Magazine, which represents some of the first-ever images shot on the iPhone 12 Pro – Apple’s latest model, which boasts a camera of almost unrivalled quality. Given the simple brief of “community”, Addy’s series embodies an “exploration with friends and old collaborators” according to the photographer, and stars his friend and fellow creative Alexander Campbell.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“The goal of the shoot was to explore colour through make-up and have fun with the idea of shooting via a mobile phone,” says Addy. “Alex is a friend who hasn’t necessarily modelled, but we feel comfortable around one another to create the images.”</p>
<p>“The images act as a sense of pure exploration as opposed to a reflection of how I am feeling about the current climate,” he adds, giving us an insight into the thought process behind the series. “One could say it’s escapism.”</p>
<p>Working with Jawara Alleyne on creative direction and make-up artist Vass Theotokis on beauty, the images see Campbell (the model) covered in an iridescent blue power in some shots and a matte red in an other. The photographs are striking – both in the intimacy with the subject and the intensity of the colour, paying testament to Addy’s skill as a photographer and the technology of this new phone.</p>

<p>Upon returning to her south London studio after lockdown, British-Indian designer <a href="/tag/supriya-lele"><strong>Supriya Lele</strong></a> was moved to see her small, all-female team dressing, day by day, with a progressive sense of flair. “I think we had all felt the need to have a bit more fun with our appearances, to feel good,“ Lele tells AnOther. This transformative power of dressing up, of clothing’s ability to make you feel good, even in the darkest of times, went on to form the basis of Lele’s optimistic and sensual Spring/Summer 2021 collection, which is showcased here on AnOthermag.com via a new short film created by Jack Day.</p>
<p>Like many of her peers, this season Lele had to think of a new way to present her <a href="/tag/springsummer-2021">Spring/Summer 2021</a> collection amid coronavirus-induced restrictions, which ruled out the possibility of a traditional, in-real-life runway show. For Lele, though, this situation presented itself as a creative opportunity, rather than a road block. “I love shows,” she says. “But I also highly value the importance of strong imagery.” So, during digital <a href="/fashion-beauty/12812/london-fashion-week-lfw-september-2020-ss21-highlights">London Fashion Week</a>, Lele revealed her collection via a series of beautiful, pared-back images shot in the stairwell of the designer’s studio.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Melding slinky lingerie-inspired silhouettes, intricate draping riffing on traditional Indian dress, and grungey influences gleaned from her adolescent years as a heavy-metal fan, the collection made a strong case for a “lo-fi” sort of sensuality that oozes confidence and play. Lele began creating the vibrant collection from an array of initial references, which ranged from films by celebrated Indian director Satyajit Ray to images of one of the 1990s’ most outlandishly dressed celebrity couples: Madonna and NBA star Dennis Rodman. A reflection of the designer’s multifaceted identity, Lele deftly weaves these eclectic references into her colourful world, producing a collection of feather-light, gauzy pieces in a joyful and warming array of summer hues, from azure blue to turquoise, fuschia and chocolatey brown. Evident in these bright and sensual pieces is a desire to make you feel good – as Lele puts it, she hopes her S/S21 designs make whoever wears them feel “confident, sexy and strong”.</p>
<p>Jack Day’s beautiful, short film – styled by Emilie Kareh – was shot during the fitting for the S/S21 lookbook, splicing together up-close photographs of the meticulously crafted pieces with tactile footage of straps being adjusted and models moving gracefully in the clothes. Also shot in Lele’s studio – with clothing hanging from ceiling light fixtures and windows – the video is a testament to the resilient, DIY spirit of London’s emerging designers during this challenging season, when many have found inventive ways to celebrate beauty in the face of uncertainty.</p>
<p>Here, speaking in her own words, Lele tells the story behind the collection.</p><p><em>“When myself and my team returned back to the studio after being in lockdown, we collectively felt that we wanted to start dressing up a little bit more each day. I think we had all felt the need to have a bit more fun with our appearances; to feel good. </em></p>
<p><em>“I think we just enjoyed being able to wear pieces that we hadn’t over lockdown; it was a gradual thing, but we all felt a sense of optimism when we returned back to the studio. This translated into the collection with the use of ‘optimistic’ fabrics, such as playful sequins, touches of lace and the colour palette: vivid blue mixed with hot pink, to lime.</em></p>
<p><em>“Overall I found the experience [of lockdown] quite mixed, I found it difficult at the beginning to get into the creative headspace, but I found other outlets like cooking, reading, watching lots of films really helped me. After a while I found myself itching to get back into the studio, and then I felt a lot more creative! I think perhaps having that space and clarity to think has been valuable. </em></p>
<p><em>“Our early reference points [for the S/S21 collection] included imagery of 90s Madonna and Dennis Rodman, old band tees, Satyajit Ray film stills ... There are removable elements within certain pieces – such as the thong within the trouser – so that you could choose how you would like to wear it. Or, within the draped dresses, the straps can be moved around quite easily, which changes the drape on the body; so you can really change how you would like to wear the pieces depending on your mood or environment.</em></p><p><em>“Personally, I feel that overall there are so many pieces which define this season it’s hard to make a choice. I love the trousers with the underwear element, and the ruched blue dress.</em></p>
<p><em>“I love shows, but I also highly value the importance of strong imagery. I think it really depends on the designer, and how they feel it’s best to communicate their vision. I don’t think that brands should be limited to showcasing only in standardised formats, I think the beauty of our industry is that there is an openness and support for new thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>“The development and fitting process is integral to what we do in the studio; this is how the collections really come together. We really wanted to showcase this aspect of how the collection comes to life [through the Jack Day-shot film]. </em></p>
<p><em>“I think a more sustainable way of working is needed, a bit of a slower pace. As an emerging brand, we had to work at an even smaller capacity, so what we made reflected the capabilities of our team and studio at that time; a smaller body of work.”</em></p>]]>

<p>“I have this memory of [my mother] saying that when women want to change the way they dress, the dress becomes a way to express themselves,” said <a href="/tag/maria-grazia-chiuri">Maria Grazia Chiuri</a>, artistic director of <strong><a href="/tag/christian-dior">Dior</a></strong>’s womenswear, prior to her Autumn/Winter 2020 show. “Sometimes, you don’t remember the name of the designer, but you remember the name of the woman wearing the dress.” At this show, which was set against a backdrop of flashing neon signs made in collaboration with the anonymous artist collective Claire Fontaine (reading “When women strike the world stops”, “Patriarchy = climate emergency”, “Consent. Consent. Consent”, among other statements), Chiuri recalled her coming of age and feminist awakening in the 1970s. Referencing photographs of herself taken during this time, she presented an informal and relaxed offering, which reinvented the iconography of Dior – the Saddle bag, the silk scarf and the Oblique canvas – for a new era. Here, photographer Charlotte Wales and AnOther Magazine’s senior fashion editor-at-large Agata Belcen capture this collection, in a story that appears in AnOther Magazine Autumn/Winter 2020.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>What is it? </strong>Inspired by <em>13th</em>, Ava DuVernay’s award-winning Netflix documentary dissecting the 13th amendment and the US justice system, <em>Say My Name</em> is an exhibition dedicated to connecting African diaspora in Europe and America with the histories of the continent, while honouring the Black experience in the Western world.</p>
<p>Curated by London-based Signature African Art’s gallery director Khalil Akar and presented by DuVernay herself, the exhibition will take place in both London and Los Angeles. Each show features 13 African artists who have used their talents to create portrait paintings and sculptures to articulate the many layers of Black history and racial struggles on a global scale, while paying tribute to prominent figures both past and present, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, whose brutal killings by police sparked the rise of this year’s Black Lives Matter movement worldwide.</p>
<p>“We’ve picked 13 artists, seven female and six male, all of which are based in Africa. We wanted to be the bridge that connects artists from the continent and issues that are taking place in the continent with what’s happening in Europe and the US. As far as I know, it has never really been done before,” explains Akar. “I worked with Ava DuVernay on this as the entire exhibition was inspired by her documentary, <em>13th</em>. We came up with all the topics for the exhibition together and then I showed her the artists that I had in mind for each one and she gave the OK, so she was involved in the whole process, from the concept to the staging of the show.”</p>
<p>The show is made special by the artists, who carefully considered their given topics, using intricate details to portray the subject of their art. In his tribute to George Floyd, Nigerian artist Oluwole Omofemi has created a series of nine paintings, each symbolising the approximate nine minutes Floyd’s neck was pressed upon by the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, as well as featuring the last nine sentences he uttered before his death, including the haunting words, “I can’t breathe”. Similarly, Benin-based Moufouli Bello, whose work focuses on identity and ideology, presents a stunning portrait of Breonna Taylor. Meanwhile artist Dennis Osakue honours iconic American activist Angela Davis with a portrait that is so carefully detailed that it bears photographic quality, and contemporary artist Taiye Erewele beautifully depicts Kenyan activist and the first African woman to win the Nobel Prize, Wangari Maathai.</p>
<p>“The artists we picked needed to have a very deep range because of the issues we’re covering,” says Akar. “We needed people that could really pull it off artistically. So, we needed to consider their individual art forms and whether they could be adapted to the strong subject of the exhibition. I had an idea in mind for pretty much each artist and the topics I’d like them to cover within the subject but then when I spoke to them, we started bouncing ideas off each other to come up with the best concepts.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>Why do I want to see it?</strong><strong> </strong>In a time where educating ourselves about Black history is more crucial than ever, the exhibition acts as the perfect teacher. Not only does it showcase the talents of Black artists but it highlights crucial moments in Black history, from the transatlantic slave trade and heroes of the Civil Rights Movement in America, to the treatment of the Windrush generation in Britain and lesser-known issues like gender-based violence in South Africa.</p>
<p>“There are so many crazy facts that you learn along the way when researching something like this. For example, one of my artists is from South Africa and his piece is all about gender-based violence in the country, it’s a huge thing over there and he has linked that to police brutality in America,” says Akar. “There are a lot of issues in the Western world that also take place in Africa. I grew up in Nigeria myself, I lived there for 20 years. In regards to history, I was in French school, but we had a few years of studying African history and obviously you then learn new things about African-American history. Everybody wants to wrap Black history into the same cloth, but you can’t, it’s not the same. As well as US history and African history, you’ve got Black-British history with topics like the Windrush generation which itself is one thing, it takes time to learn about that. It’s so different when you hear about things and then actually learn the facts and figures behind it.”</p>
<p>In an effort to support the Black community, Signature African Art will donate 40 per cent of the proceeds from <em>Say My Name </em>to DuVernay’s <a href="https://www.leapaction.org/">Law Enforcement Accountability Project</a> (LEAP), a fund focused on empowering activists to tell stories of police abuse and violence through various narrative art forms. The gallery has also committed to donating its share of proceeds from the sales of the portraits of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor to their respective families.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>Where can I see it? </strong>The <em>Say My Name</em> exhibition will be showcased at Signature African Art’s gallery in Mayfair, London from October 27 to November 28, in honour of Black History Month in the UK. It will then open in Los Angeles in February 2021 with further details of the participating artists and works to be announced later this year, as they will differ slightly. Both shows will be presented by DuVernay.</p>
<p>“We have a piece that’s dedicated to the history of the Windrush generation in the UK but there’s also works on African history and African-American history. Similarly, the exhibition in America will feature pieces inspired by history from all three continents because we want to link the three together. The whole idea is to raise awareness for it all. People in America may not be as familiar with Black-British history or African history, while people in Britain might not be familiar with African history or some aspects of African-American history.”</p>
<p><em>Say My Name, presented by Ava DuVernay is at <a href="https://signatureafricanart.com/">Signature African Art</a>, London from October 27 – November 28, 2020.</em></p>]]>

<p>During a season unlike any other, designers have been presenting their collections in myriad alternative ways, from still- and moving-image, to physical objects such as publications and socially distanced runway shows. Of course, the latter have not been possible – or thinkable – for many. This has been a particular shame for designers like <strong>Charles Jeffrey</strong>, whose shows, bordering on theatre, often represented the highlight of the London Fashion Week schedule. Charged with an electric, no-holds-barred creativity, these shows were all about freedom and community – the very antithesis of this current moment we are living through, marked as it is by restriction and confinement. Still, Jeffrey was not to be deterred.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Today, the designer reveals his “viscerally happy, exhilarating and kind of chaotic” Spring/Summer 2021 collection, entitled <em>The Healing</em>, via a project created in collaboration with his friend, the photographer Tim Walker. A campaign as well as a physical object – a boxed concertina zine, which will no doubt become a collectible item – the project comprises a series of euphoric photographs of Jeffrey’s community, dressed in his collection. While the images pay testament to his creativity as a designer, and to Walker’s inventiveness as a photographer, it is a relatively pared-back offering from Jeffrey, who says he deliberately kept it free from the “bells-and-whistles outside of these gorgeous adorned bodies”.</p>
<p>Here, Jeffrey discusses the project in further detail, revealing how it came together and what it was like working with Walker.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“Anyone who is familiar with what we do as a brand will, I guess, be able to work out how devastating it was to realise at the start of the year that we weren’t going to be able to show. It felt, back then, like something physically being taken away from us. Shows and physical happenings have been such a big part of our DNA for the past five or six years, that we were thrown into a bit of a momentary slump. That was the beginning of the year, obviously, and a lot has happened since then. A lot of opportunity for growth, and change, and new mindsets.</em></p>
<p><em>“This new body of work – ‘The Healing’ – is probably the longest collection we’ve ever worked on in terms of end-to-end time span … It’s been a real journey with this collection. And we’re choosing to present it not only as a digital release – it’s anchored by a beautiful campaign shot by my dear friend Tim Walker – but also as a physical object. It’s been rendered as a book; a boxed concertina zine, which has been art directed by the really wonderful team at 23. They’re responsible for </em>LOVE<em> magazine, and countless other amazing projects – it’s been a thrill to get to work with them. The boxes are not only being sent out around the world, to the people who’d usually come to our shows, but we’re also making them available to buy. I like the democracy of that; that our customers can tangibly get a piece of the action just as a critic or a buyer would.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“The project has done a bit of a full-circle journey … We’re thinking of it as documenting a mood shift. The collection started in one place and the realisation of the project ended up somewhere very different. When we were designing, we explored a lot of ‘stay away’ ideas – it was a time when we were all completely isolating. So we started thinking about colour and how colour features in nature as a warning sign. Lots of deadly nightshade plants and orb spiders. We then started to approach it all quite differently and it sort of bloomed into this idea of colour as therapy … We looked a lot at chromotherapy, an amazing ancient practice that’s still around now, which uses coloured light to align with chakras. I’m quite into that stuff! We took colour as the continued anchor, and explored the kind of nervous joy we were all feeling about being able to see people in the flesh again. It became quite primal: there’s a lot of ‘altered states’ we’ve looked at. Joy, sex … We’ve gone very sexy this time, actually!</em></p>
<p><em>“My creative process always features a lot of walking and listening to music – it’s where I get all my ideas from, I go into something called the theta state, which is where our brains move to when we problem solve. Some people get it in the shower … ! We liked the idea of the concertina element of our book sort of replicating that, this long line of images almost reading like a train of thought, or stream of consciousness. I wanted it to really take up space.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“The first time I met Tim was for a shoot – he shot me in a set-up where I was squished by a huge shoe for Oxfam … ! He then shot my work three times for various things, and we became close friends. He’s like a mentor to me in life. I kind of forget he’s Tim Walker The Legend. He’s an incredible person. The project was just super in-the-moment and instinctive; Tim knows I like to bring a lot to the table, and we shot so many people in such a short amount of time. The energy on our two shoot days was really quite electric. We deliberately kept the set-up quite free of set or bells-and-whistles outside of these gorgeous adorned bodies. People weren’t cast as ‘characters’ other than themselves – it’s a very real treatment.”</em></p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>“When I can bring myself to watch horror, I find it incredibly rewarding,” says Morfydd Clark, the Welsh actor and star of <strong><em>Saint Maud </em></strong>– the most fiercely anticipated film of the genre to come out this year – which has been picked up by A24 (<em>Uncut Gems</em>, <em>Hereditary</em>, <em>Lady Bird</em>, <em>Moonlight</em> and more). “I find sad horrors very difficult,” she continues, “I watched <em>Goodnight Mommy</em> and it was just so sad as well as terrifying that I was like, ‘I can only watch <em>The Bogeyman</em> from now on.’ Social horrors are the ones that really send me into a terrible spiral, in a way that makes me a better person.”</p>
<p><em>Saint Maud</em>, then, seems exactly the kind of film someone of Clark’s disposition might steer away from. But shot mostly in a school in Islington – with a mid-December stint in Scarborough, where the film is set – Clark’s first lead role explores the relationship between religion and mental health through the sometimes gruesome lens of horror. Having experienced a never-fully-explained trauma while working for the NHS, Clark’s Maud becomes a private healthcare worker whose first patient is a celebrated former dancer called Amanda (Jennifer Ehle).</p>
<p>“I was raised Christian and I’m a pretty neurotic person,” explains writer-director Rose Glass of the film’s genesis. “It’s only in the last few years that I’ve started to think critically and with more self-awareness about both subjects and how they connect: <em>Saint Maud</em> is just what came naturally.” Despite being a relative stranger before joining the project, Clark immediately identified with the themes in Glass’s script. “I have a lot of thoughts but I don’t have stories in me, so reading it was like ‘this is what I’d write if I could write’,” she enthuses. “I’m not religious, but my dad’s been in and out of faith and I’ve always found that interesting.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402856.jpg" alt="Saint Maud, 2020" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>Maud’s connection to God is born from her earlier professional distress, by the time she meets Amanda her religion is overwhelming her. From her modest appearance (the scraped back ponytail and modern tunic and trousers of an earlier scene are replaced with a low pony and more conservative uniform dress and wool tights when she arrives at Amanda’s) to her internal dialogue, everything she does either alludes to or is outright propelled by Him. This intensity similarly frames her behaviour and interactions with Amanda, who entertains her faith by asking questions, and later gifting Maud, “my saviour”, a William Blake book. Lines are inevitably blurred, and the pair’s relationship ends after an uncomfortable scene at a party. </p>
<p>“I'm interested in human behaviour and why we do the things we do,” says Glass. “I like finding out what makes people tick; the weirder the better.” For Clark, the role meant looking inwards. “I don’t become someone else when I’m acting at all,” she says, instead searching for the parts of herself that relate to the role she’s playing. “I’ve often felt that there’s a parallel world where I’m very lonely because I’ve argued too much and haven’t apologised enough and that’s something that chills my nightmares, so this idea of playing someone incredibly lonely is a particular horror of mine.” Loosely in tandem with playing Maud were roles in <em>Eternal Beauty</em> and <em>His Dark Materials</em> – Craig Roberts’ recent feature and the BBC One show respectively – both of which saw Clark play women who “were seen as not fitting in, and therefore seeming to be frightening or dangerous,” and subsequently bled into the character. </p>
<p>In addition to examining her own behaviours, research fell on those around her; many family members are doctors or nurses. “Growing up with someone who was being worked very hard in the NHS, I have been quite fascinated by how people did this work,” she says. “There were occasions where my mum was deeply affected by something at work, and I couldn’t understand how she ever managed to compartmentalise. Reading Maud made sense because I was like yeah, if I was working in the health service without support, I would struggle hugely.” Engaging with early feedback for the film, which had its world premiere at TIFF in 2019, Clark found others currently working in the sector concurred. “They were glad they saw it but it was very painful,” she says. “I’m so glad we’ve made a film that makes sense, but that it does ring true in some ways, that’s been sad, to see that this horror is not far from people’s worlds who are doing the most important, most thankless work.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="EXs2-TY9qok"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXs2-TY9qok" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>On set, any mental health concerns of her own were lifted by Ehle, who volunteered her care. “I don’t know if I’d have been able to do it if it hadn’t been with someone so lovely. Also Rose – having the three of us together was really special. Three quite quiet introverted people who got to be quiet and introverted together.” That the film was her debut lead (she’s on screen throughout), Glass’s debut feature, and a first for several other crew members created a productive and ultimately united atmosphere. “This film was a big deal for a lot of us,” agrees Glass, “the personal stakes felt high and everyone threw themselves into it. I’m aware it’s boring and nauseating to say how bloody nice everyone was, how much fun we had. But we really did and they really were.”</p>
<p><em>Saint Maud is in cinemas now.</em></p>]]>

<p>Yesterday, <strong>Comme des Garçons</strong> presented its Spring/Summer 2021 collection in a socially-distanced and minimally-attended runway show, staged at the brand’s headquarters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>True to form, the label hasn’t revealed much about the collection, simply offering a few words on the theme for the season: dissonance. “The human brain always looks for harmony and logic,” it said in a statement. “When harmony is denied, where there is no logic, when there is dissonance ... a powerful moment is created which leads you to feel an inner turmoil and a tension ... that can lead to find positive change and progress.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>It could well be that these words, and by extension this collection, represent Rei Kawakubo’s response to the events of this year, which has been devoid of harmony and logic – but, hopefully, can lead to change and progress.</p>
<p>This sentiment is reflected in the clothes through the use of “unexpected” and constrasting fabrics which are brought together in illogical ways. Bathed in red light – which itself suggests turmoil – these fabrics include PVC, a Mickey Mouse print and polkadot pattern, evoking chaos, yes, but also a playfulness.</p>
<p>Separately, other members of the Comme des Garçons family of designers – Junya Watanabe and Noir Kei Ninomiya – have also debuted their Spring/Summer 2021 collections, the former reproducing “the costumes worn by the stars in my memories”, the latter citing no theme.</p>

<p>The visionary image-maker <strong>Nick Knight</strong> and <strong>Gareth Pugh</strong>, the perpetual enfant terrible of London fashion, have worked together continuously across a 15-year span, their visions perfectly matched: distorted, contorted, slightly morbid, but strangely beautiful. Nevertheless, the backgrounds of the two are, on the face of it, wildly dissimilar. Pugh grew up in Sunderland, northern England – his father was a policeman. Knight, by contrast, was raised between England, France and Belgium: his father was in the diplomatic corps. Yet the creativity of both was born from the fertile ground of subcultures. Knight made his reputation by publishing a book documenting the skinhead scene of the late Seventies and early Eighties, of which he was an active participant, while Pugh’s first fashion looks were created to satisfy the theatrical demands of London’s nightclubs in the early Noughties. His trademark outlandish creations, such as figures dressed in frogspawn clusters of red and white striped balloons, as giant poodles, smothered in PVC and gimp-masked – looks first worn by Pugh himself, then his models – have a clear through line to the flamboyance of Eighties post-punk and new romantic partying. Less, “Look at me”, more “What the fuck?”</p>
<p>There are other parallels: Pugh originally pursued ballet before falling in love with fashion, explaining his fascination for transforming the body and, perhaps, the success of his collaborations with choreographers such as Wayne McGregor and Matthew Neenan of New York City Ballet. Through his teenage years, Knight wanted to<br />be a doctor, and his pursuit of photography ultimately came from the same point of view: an interest in people. The two have collaborated since the earliest days of Pugh’s career, when Knight gave over his website Showstudio.com to a seven-day performance by the then-fledgling designer. Thereafter they collaborated on a number of films and photoshoots, each urging the other in pushing the boundaries of representation of the human form.</p>
<p>The connection is deeply personal, too: Knight officiated at Pugh’s wedding to Carson McColl in 2017. </p>
<p>In 2020, they are working together once again, to showcase Pugh’s latest, 13-look collection for Spring/Summer 2021 via what Pugh dubs a “visual album”. It reflects another connection, that of devising visual identities through album imagery, videos and costume for musicians such as Björk, Lady Gaga, Massive Attack and Kylie Minogue. And fashion, in the hands of Pugh and Knight, is undoubtedly a performance – one created solely and purely for the love of the art. In conversation, the two unpack their own definitions of beauty and their respective reactions to this tumultuous cultural moment.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>Telephone conversation between Nick Knight and Gareth Pugh, August 2020.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nick Knight:</strong> Shall we talk about our new project to begin with? I’m not sure what we can say ...</p>
<p><strong>Gareth Pugh:</strong> Well, in my self-portrait I am wearing something. A preview. We haven’t shown in London since 2018, so we wanted the first thing that we did after two years to be something that was a reflection of the time, but also something that is a distillation – an essence – of what we do.</p>
<p>The idea came about that we would do very few outfits. We decided on 13 because it’s Carson’s lucky number. I don’t see them as being propositions for things that people would wear. They are 13 very particular characters, and the characters are cyphers, to convey a particular idea or meaning. The pieces that we make in London are always the things that we put our heart and soul into.</p>
<p>We decided that we would present them like a visual album, with you, through film. Each outfit is inspired by a song. There could be 13 collections there if you really wanted – 13 pointed, aggressive almost, visually rich ideas.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> The forms you’ve made in this collection are a cross-breed. They don’t look necessarily humanoid. They’re a cross between sculpture and human – they’re not machines, more a different way of looking at how people could be. A lot of your clothes, because they have always been so sculptural, do come across as armour or some form of protection. Is that fair? Do you see yourself as making things that are in some way protecting the wearer?</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Whenever we do anything in relation to clothes, we always like to imbue that wearer with a sense of empowerment, of strength. The idea of clothing as armour, I remember talking to Daphne Guinness about that – and it’s funny meeting someone like Daphne for the first time, because you expect her to be this total rock star, which she kind of is. Yet, actually, as a person she’s very quiet, very shy.</p>
<p>She said something super-insightful – that she wears what she wears so that people will look at what she has on rather than look at her. It’s either armour or a cloak of invisibility. That is something that really resonated with me – we make womenswear clothes, we wanted to do something positive. Trying to empower, to make someone feel strong, supported. So it’s all quite cyclical in that sense, but yes, I couldn’t agree more with the armour angle.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> We need armour today.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Systems are set up to benefit very few. People don’t like to be rocked. They don’t like their secure foundations to be questioned. I went to a huge amount of protests ... And there’s a point when you realise that rather than trying to organise from the top down, if you start organising from the bottom up, through communities, it has more longevity” – Gareth Pugh</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> The collection, for me, feels really positive. I guess that was the spirit of the project. There was a sea of BBC News stories, crazy stuff – the explosion in Beirut, Covid-19, and then we have Donald Trump and the election and Brexit. All of this crap. And within all of that we wanted to do something that was a beacon of light, something that was positive, something that was hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> I think it’s partly the basics of the principle of equal-opposite reaction. If you have a vile situation, like we have with the pandemic, if you have morally corrupt and redundant governments around the world, people rebel. It’s the way the political situation of the Seventies fuelled punk. It didn’t create it, but it fuelled it. However vile Boris Johnson and his cronies are, there should be an artistic reaction to that.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> Systems are set up to benefit very few. People don’t like to be rocked. They don’t like their secure foundations to be questioned.</p>
<p>Carson and I went to a huge amount of protests – Brexit, anti-Tory, trying to effect change. And obviously none of that did ... It was important to do it to be seen, but none of that really seemed to move the needle.</p>
<p>And I think there’s a point when you realise that rather than trying to organise from the top down, if you start organising from the bottom up, through communities and effecting change, there is much more possibility of it working. Also, it has more longevity, because those people at the top are never going to choose to move the needle themselves. They need to be told or shamed into doing that. This whole situation with the pandemic has forced people into this situation where they have to change. Out of all of this madness, I’m sure – I’m hopeful – something great will coalesce.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> I think that there’s a real desire for change now and you see it reflected in so many different ways in contemporary culture. Through the Black Lives Matter movement, people have said, “That’s enough, you can’t keep on doing it that way.” Political expression through fashion is important because it’s so ingrained in us and our lives. I think now is a very important time to embrace politics in fashion. If fashion is devoid of life, it’s nothing.</p>
<p>There’s a sense of injustice, of ongoing injustice, which makes it very important to engage. The people have a voice now – they can start their own Instagram page, they can call out, the public have a voice. And that also affects what designers do, how fashion is seen, so they no longer exist in that bubble.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> You’re right when you’ve said in the past that an industry that is based on change is one of the slowest-moving industries with regard to interior change. Systemic change does take a lot of work, a lot of sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> I do get surprised when I hear people being reactionary. You work in the fashion industry – why on earth are you being so reductive, so backward-looking? One wants the world to be a better place and one wants the world to be something that feels more inclusive and exciting. And you see things happening across the world that are so heinous and so morally corrupt you just have to react. We can’t see the death of democracy in America and Britain and not react to it. It really is quite shocking what we’re going through at the moment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You see things happening across the world that are so heinous and so morally corrupt you just have to react. We can’t see the death of democracy in America and Britain and not react to it”<br />– Nick Knight</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> It is also quite fascinating to understand that link that fashion has to what’s going on around us and how you can track all of that. It’s such a cultural marker, an indicator.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> I do see it as a fundamental art form and fundamental way of expressing ourselves, which is culturally so relevant and so reactive and predictive of the times we live in, and predictive of our own self-image.</p>
<p>This is a strange age that we are moving into, because it is the age defined by the internet, where technology becomes fundamentally part of us. We enhance ourselves as beings by the use of technology, through biotechnology and technology itself. We are becoming a new species – and people don’t want to really look at that in an artistic or positive way. But we are creating new identities, different guises, that exist in the digital world rather than just in the physical world. So I’m interested in how you, as somebody who creates visions of the future or visions of the way people aspire to look, view that.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> My idea of beauty is a difficult one. For me it’s about the person first and then it’s about heightening them – it’s about all of these things we can add to them. I’m curious, what is your idea of beauty, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> People often talk about the Björk Homogenic album cover, and my 1997 Devon Aoki picture for Visionaire. Both are in a similar mould, for me – a cross-species kind of thing. It didn’t end up on the cover, but for Homogenic, Björk actually asked me to give her gills, as if she lived at the bottom of the sea. There is a real freedom in her mind – and some other people’s – of how they want to express visions of beauty, what they want to put out into the world. I hope those were both quite forward-looking visions of how humans could be.</p>
<p><strong>GP:</strong> You are someone who excels at that. I think it’s nice to always exist within that space that is always questioning, is always excited by newness, because out of that comes something different.</p>
<p><strong>NK:</strong> You asked what my idea of beauty is and I think it’s anything that I feel I haven’t seen before that touches my heart. So, within the Devon idea, it’s this fragile, almost childlike heroine who has taken on an adversary and emerges noble and proud. And the ideas that you create are these visions that take you to a different realm of humanity that we haven’t seen before. Are they half-technology and half-human? Are they cross-species, cross-gender? It’s the freedom of your work that I find beautiful, the freedom to be able to think and freely associate without fear. The future is a very funny thing, because it’s so subjective and so personal.</p>
<p>But the visions you produce certainly do have incredible beauty to them, but are from a different time, a different evolutionary point. What I find truly beautiful is the freedom of spirit, and to be able to express that. That’s what I get drawn to, in the different people that I work with.</p>
<p>I’ve been working with you for some time now, Gareth, and I will keep on, if you still want to. I want to work with you because it’s not transient. It’s that freedom of expression and projection of ideas that is fascinating. I find that beautiful.</p>

<p>Magnum Photos’ twice yearly Square Print Sale – in which signed or estate-stamped, museum-quality prints are available to buy for just $100 – launches today, this time in partnership with the New York-based Aperture Foundation. Themed on ‘Imagination’, the week-long sale features inspiring images by the world’s best photographers: <a href="/tag/mary-ellen-mark">Mary Ellen Mark</a>, <a href="/tag/alec-soth">Alec Soth</a>, <a href="/tag/joel-meyerowitz">Joel Meyerowitz</a>, <a href="/tag/don-mccullin">Don McCullin</a>, Leonard Freed, <a href="/tag/sunil-gupta">Sunil Gupta</a>, <a href="/tag/nan-goldin">Nan Goldin</a>, <a href="/tag/susan-meiselas">Susan Meiselas</a>, <a href="/tag/bruce-davidson">Bruce Davidson</a>, Gregory Halpern, among many others.  </p>
<p>The Square Print Sale features over 100 photographs. “Toward the end of a year that has seen a series of international events unparalleled in recent memory, these images bring together a collection of works from disparate storytelling and artistic practices: works of fact and fiction with the potential to inspire our social and artistic imagination,” reads a statement from Magnum Photos as the sale launches this afternoon. </p>
<p>Among the selection are images of vast landscapes, historical figures – Martin Luther King appears twice – and some from recognisable series. Two collectives also feature in the sale, <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/read-up-act-up-autumn-2020/article/50410/1/read-up-act-up-autumn-2020-wide-awakes-guest-edit">Wide Awakes</a> and <a href="https://forfreedoms.org/">For Freedoms</a>, both of which are artist-led organisations: the former based on the 1860 Wide Awake movement which mobilised against slavery and now working to get out the vote; the latter “models and increases creative civic engagement, discourse and direct action”.</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>The 64th <strong>London Film Festival</strong> concluded this past weekend, taking place both online and in select cinemas across the UK in light of these unprecedented times, offering roughly a fifth of the usual number of features presented in a normal year, alongside shorts, experimental and VR works, and a couple of TV series previews. The festival ended with showings of Francis Lee’s period lesbian romance <em>Ammonite</em>, starring Kate Winslet and <a href="/search?q=Saoirse+Ronan">Saoirse Ronan</a>, in hundreds of cinemas nationwide, while Thomas Vinterberg’s drama <em>Another Round</em> won the inaugural LFF Audience Award.</p>
<p>Here are ten of the best titles from LFF 2020 worth looking out for in the future; some on their way to cinemas or digital soon, others further off.</p>
<h3>1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2NFplc5JfU"><em>Striding Into the Wind</em></a> (lead image)</h3>
<p>Beijing-born director Wei Shujun presents a somewhat metatextual commentary on the state of contemporary Chinese cinema as his idiosyncratic and contemplative debut feature; a road movie concerning slackerdom and film school screw-ups. Protagonist Kun (Zhou You) is a talented sound recordist in his final year, who is getting some work experience on actual productions, but he doesn’t take his remaining studies seriously and focuses his attention on visiting Inner Mongolia with his girlfriend, Zhi (Zheng Yingchen).</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402828.jpg" alt="David-Byrnes-American-Utopia-2020-1" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<h3>2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg4hcgtjDPc"><em>David Byrne’s American Utopia</em></a></h3>
<p>David Byrne’s 2019 Broadway show, based on his recent album and tour of the same name, is documented here, though with Spike Lee in the directing chair, this is far from a standard point-and-shoot situation like you might get with a National Theatre Live broadcast. An actual film in its own right, <em>American Utopia</em> is eccentric, fully immersive and an utterly euphoric experience that calls for a rise up against hate and complacency. Almost no concert documentary can top Jonathan Demme and Talking Heads’ <em>Stop Making Sense</em> (1984), but it seems only fitting that one of the closest to do so should once again feature Byrne as bandleader.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402829.jpg" alt="Wolfwalkers-2020-1" />        <figcaption>

<h3>3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_Z_tybgPgg"><em>Wolfwalkers</em></a></h3>
<p>Irish animation studio Cartoon Saloon (<em>Song of the Sea</em>, <em>The Breadwinner</em>) reaches new heights with the gorgeous fantasy epic <em>Wolfwalkers</em>, a rich and intelligent environmental fable that uses revisionist history to thrilling effect. Set during Oliver Cromwell’s invasion of Ireland in the 17th century, the film explores the burgeoning friendship between Robyn, the daughter of an English hunter over in Ireland to exterminate the wild wolves, and Mebh, a free-spirited girl living deep in the woods, from a tribe rumoured to both control wolves and also transform into them.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402830.jpg" alt="Possessor-2020-01_-_Copy (1)" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<h3>4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kV3IJcFRX8"><em>Possessor</em></a></h3>
<p>An enigmatic, absorbing, hallucinatory and frequently grisly hybrid of sci-fi, cyberpunk and body horror, <em>Possessor </em>sees writer-director Brandon Cronenberg make literal the idea of one’s body being little more than another tool for corporate demons. A bleach-blonde Andrea Riseborough plays an agent of a secretive organisation using brain implant hardware to inhabit people’s bodies, possessing them to perform assassinations on behalf of wealthy clients. Riseborough and Christopher Abbott are both mesmerising as the souls fighting over one body.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402831.jpg" alt="Limbo-2020-2" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<h3>5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5SHfscrM7U"><em>Limbo</em></a></h3>
<p>Writer-director Ben Sharrock’s second feature is a moving and funny tragicomic drama that carefully balances deadpan humour with piercing pain. Stylistically something of a blend of the works of Aki Kaurismäki and the great Scottish filmmaker Bill Forsyth, <em>Limbo</em> focuses on Omar (Amir El-Masry), a Syrian musician stationed on a freezing Hebridean island off the northwest coast of Scotland, awaiting word on the status of his asylum application. He shares an assigned house with three refugees from other countries, each coping with the apparent futility of their hopes and dreams in their own ways.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402832.jpg" alt="Undine-2020-2b" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<h3>6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=El4-2zrNppA"><em>Undine</em></a></h3>
<p>Inspired by the 19th-century fairytale novella of the same name, rooted in mythology and concerning water nymphs and love pacts, <em>Undine</em> sees writer-director Christian Petzold (<em>Transit</em>, <em>Phoenix</em>) flirt between fantasy and semi-realist contemporary drama, exploring the idea of all-consuming romance’s ties to the eradication of oneself. His reunited <em>Transit</em> stars Franz Rogowski and Paula Beer shine as, respectively, industrial diver Christoph and Undine, an urban historian whose fate seems connected to how the aquatic myth plays out.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h3>7. <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TO3gp3j8_4">One Night in Miami … </a></em></h3>
<p>Oscar-winning actor Regina King (<em>If Beale Street Could Talk</em>) directs this electric adaptation of Kemp Powers’ 2013 stage play of the same name, which takes a real-life hangout between four African-American icons, about which little is known, and presents a fictionalised “what if?” scenario concerning this meeting of influential minds. The date in question: February 25, 1964, the night that Cassius Clay (Eli Goree) defeated Sonny Liston in a title bout in Miami, with the 22-year-old boxer – soon to become Muhammad Ali – then spending the night with friend Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), soul legend Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) and NFL superstar Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge).</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h3>8. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSuf36TKyrk"><em>Wildfire</em></a></h3>
<p>Nora-Jane Noone and the late Nika McGuigan – who passed away during post-production – are both extraordinary in writer-director Cathy Brady’s bracing debut feature <em>Wildfire</em>, a haunting portrait of personal and political trauma intertwined. Set at the Irish border, with the uncertainties of Brexit omnipresent on TV news, it sees two estranged sisters reunited after one’s long, abrupt absence, their intense and complicated bond reignited as they deal with generational wounds and mental illness. A raw drama with a lot on its mind.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402836.jpg" alt="Nomandland-2020-1" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<h3>9. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVP7PNRx8Mw"><em>Nomadland</em></a></h3>
<p>Chloé Zhao’s <em>Nomadland</em> places Frances McDormand in the centre of a tender though unromantic American odyssey, which gradually devastates with its portrait of the brutal cycles of the gig economy and whole communities destroyed by economic collapse. McDormand’s Fern used to live and work in a Nevada town that was built around an industry that no longer exists anymore. Now widowed, she lives out of her van and travels for seasonal employment, eventually getting involved with modern nomads, many of whom are played in the film by actual nomads.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402835.jpeg" alt="Eyimofe-This-Is-My-Desire-2020-5" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<h3>10. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw9NlHbi6rI"><em>Eyimofe (This Is My Desire)</em></a></h3>
<p>The Nigerian debut feature from brothers Arie and Chuko Esiri, <em>Eyimofe</em> is a realist drama about migration complications, split into two distinct stories via a plotting structure vaguely reminiscent of Wong Kar-wai’s <em>Chungking Express</em> (1994). Capturing Lagos on 16mm film in a way both the West and the prosperous Nigerian film industry don’t tend to see, this is a patient, evocative and moving film where the city is just as much a character in the text as the people onscreen.</p>]]>

<p>The government retaliated against Mogutin in two highly publicised criminal cases, charging the young writer with “malicious hooliganism with exceptional cynicism and extreme insolence”. After attempting to officially register the first same-sex marriage in Russia in 1994, Mogutin was forced to flee his native land. The following year, at the tender age of 21, he became the first Russian granted political asylum in the United States on the grounds of homophobic persecution. </p>
<p>“I see my photography as a form of political activism and protest against systemic bigotry and censorship,” says Mogutin, who is currently showing <a href="https://www.galerie-kernweine.com/"><em>Polaroid Rage and Black Is Beautiful</em></a> at Galerie Kernweine in Stuttgart, Germany. The works are a timely response to our current climate. “I feel like I paid my dues as a taxpaying citizen to be able to address the evils of Trump’s America the same way as I’ve been speaking out against the evils of Putin’s Russia.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Shot over the past two years in New York, Los Angeles, and Berlin, <em>Polaroid Rage</em> features portraits and nudes of Mogutin’s contemporaries including Genesis P-Orridge, Jordan Hall of Boy Radio, Latex Lucifer, Buck Angel, Brian Kenny, Durk Dehner, and Mogutin’s girlfriend and muse, trans artist and model Maxima Cortina.</p>
<p>“For me photography is always about collaboration. It’s a moment, mood and emotion you share with the person you capture,” Mogutin says. “I mostly work with friends – people who are aware of my work and aware of themselves, people with strong personalities and identities, comfortable with their bodies and sexuality. For me diversity is the key – in terms of gender, race, age, nationalities. The main focus of my work is queer youth but I always pay tribute to my heritage, the queer elders who came before the internet and social media.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>The second series, <em>Black Is Beautiful</em>, takes its title from <a href="/art-photography/10509/the-photographer-behind-the-black-is-beautiful-movement">Kwame Brathwaite</a>’s 1960s cultural movement, which created a space for the celebration of African features and aesthetics using Black-owned businesses and platforms. “Black visibility in mainstream culture today is as important as it was back in the 60s, and as important as queer and trans visibility,” says Mogutin.</p>
<p>“I’ve been putting people of colour front and centre in my work for many years. With my show in Stuttgart I wanted to make a statement of solidarity with Black Lives Matter,” Mogutin continues. “In my 25 years in America, I haven’t seen this country so divided and polarised. I could never imagine that my adopted home could become a place where our fundamental rights and freedoms are under a constant attack from our own government. At the time when trust in politics and our institutions is undermined and compromised, it’s more important than ever to fight for our rights and stand up to bigotry, hatred and censorship of all kinds. When the system rejects us, we must reject the system.”</p><p><em>Slava Mogutin: </em><a href="https://www.galerie-kernweine.com/"><em>Polaroid Rage and Black Is Beautiful</em></a><em> at Galerie Kernweine in Stuttgart, Germany, through November 22, 2020.</em></p>]]>

<p>“Every collection has an intimacy to me, emotionally and physically,” <a href="/tag/simone-rocha"><strong>Simone Rocha</strong></a> says over email as the Irish designer prepares to reveal her latest project – a beautiful and intimate zine made in collaboration with photographer <a href="https://kerryjdean.com/">Kerry J Dean</a>, which captures Rocha’s dark and elegant Autumn/Winter 2020 collection on Dean and her three-year-old son at home. Bringing together sublime natural scenes, vulnerable nude self-portraiture and Rocha’s designs, the project is an immersion into Dean’s own private world, and a tender ode to both mothers and Mother Nature. </p>
<p>Rocha first became aware of Dean when she saw the photographer’s striking series <a href="https://kerryjdean.com/collection/pom-poms/"><em>Pom Pom Girls</em></a>, which documents schoolgirls in the Gobi desert in Mongolia, who sport serious looks and colourful flower hair scrunchies amid searing blue skies, local buildings and stretches of sand. “Then during lockdown she personally reached out to me about collaboration on a project,” Rocha explains. After exchanging ideas, the two women decided on a photo story about family – something that is central to both Rocha and Dean’s respective personal worlds, and something that has become more vital to many of us than ever before through the hardships of this tumultuous year. “I wanted to work on one project that focused on the time we were in, personally and socially, looking inwards, holding dear what’s most important,” Dean explains. </p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Shot amid the lush and verdant landscapes of the English countryside, <em>Self, Son, and Simone</em>’s intimate pages are filled with scenes of maternal closeness which are characterised by joy, warmth and play, but also, in places, tinged with a sense of isolation and melancholy befitting the times we are currently living in. In its pages, we see beautiful portraits on empty beaches and wild, green glades, which suggest there isn’t another soul nearby for hundreds of miles. As with Rocha’s romantic and ceremonial designs, a tension between celebratory radiance and darkness is there. “I find beauty in the darkness, the unsettling,” <a href="/fashion-beauty/12763/simone-rocha-interview-aw20-show-collection-film-2020">the designer told AnOther</a> this summer. “It’s always that tension that I find beautiful and interesting.” </p>
<p>Dean moved from bustling London to her countryside idyll with her son and partner at the start of this challenging and unique year, acquiring a disused flower nursery the photographer describes as a “magical and feral” place, punctuated by a “mishmash of meadows, dilapidated potting sheds and greenhouses and overgrown woodland”. “Little did we know how vivid the change would be; isolation, a new reality, a new normal,” the photographer writes in the zine’s introduction, describing this uncertain period of time as both “exhilarating and exhausting, filled with elation and joy in tandem with heartbreak and loss”. Though the past few months have been marked by a whirlwind of emotions for Dean – a result of the move, upheaval of lockdown, and the experience of a personal loss in her life – the photographer states that she hasn’t looked back. “London will always have a huge part of my heart, but having space, trees and sea air is life affirming, as is watching our three-year-old grow up in and amongst it.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/659/azure/another-prod/400/2/402807.jpg" alt="Self, Son, and Simone" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>In these private images – which softly capture skin-on-skin embraces between mother and son, walks down the coast, and the in-between moments of life in nature – are designs from Rocha’s breathtaking <a href="/fashion-beauty/12257/simone-rocha-beautiful-new-collection-aw20-london-fashion-week">Autumn/Winter 2020 collection</a>. “There’s such a ceremony to her clothes, even in the dressing itself, they felt beautifully theatrical, and quite transformative,” Dean says of how Rocha’s designs made her feel. The collection’s initial inspiration came from Dublin-born playwright John Millington Synge’s <em>Riders to the Sea</em>, a stirring play about loss, nature and human resilience, which tells the tale of sons and a father drowned at sea, and the grieving mother and wife who is left behind. The resulting designs made for a particularly powerful and poetic collection, which wove the universal experiences which touch each of our lives into every piece – birth, ritual, loss, life and death. “For Kerry to take the collection into her own world and perspective it really felt right for my A/W20 collection, which in essence is a story about family,” says Rocha. “I think in the pictures these themes are explored through motherhood, childhood and nature.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>For both women, the lockdown has made a yearning for familial closeness more keenly felt than ever, something which is evident in the pages of <em>Self, Son, and Simone</em>. “With everything this year there has been more focus and intimacy which has translated into the work,” says Rocha. For both, motherhood and women are central to not only their personal lives, but to their work too – “being a mum influences everything,” says Dean. “Motherhood is always relevant to me as it’s a part of my life,” adds Rocha. </p>
<p>Evident too is a “craving for nature”, as Rocha puts it, something felt by many these past few months, when a need to escape and ground oneself has never been greater. “I didn’t grow up near the sea. I didn’t anticipate it being so addictive and so part of life,” Dean says appreciatively of her new surroundings. “Cold-water swimming is a therapy. I can’t now imagine not having that.” For Rocha, though, the sea has long held a special meaning to her. “Being from Ireland, a small island surrounded by the sea, it’s always felt very close to me,” the designer says. “I think we are at our most peaceful and natural in nature and the elements … The landscape and escapism. Also there is nothing like getting into the sea, head under to feel reborn.” </p><p><em>Self, Son, and Simone is available at the Simone Rocha Mount Street store in London and Wooster Street store in New York from October 16, 2020. </em></p>]]>

<p><strong>Who is it?</strong> “As a child I was always making up dream worlds and playing,” says designer <strong>Róisín Pierce </strong>of her upbringing in rural Galway, Ireland. This active imagination – and penchant for making clothes for her Barbie dolls – lead the designer to pursue a BA in Textile Design at Dublin’s National College of Art and Design. It was there that Pierce honed her mastery of texture and fabric development, which underpin the distinctive look and ethos of her namesake label. “That programme really played into what I’m doing today ... [it’s] very textured, experimental; it’s about developing things and challenging what textiles can be in clothing,” she says. Her frothy, sculptural confections – reminiscent of whipped cream peaks, or buttercream icing flowers – won the designer the Public Prize at the 34th <a href="/tag/hyeres">Hyères Festival</a>, and the first-ever Prix Métiers d’Art Chanel.</p>
<p>Beneath the sweetness however, Pierce’s pieces are steeped in Irish heritage and history. Her debut collection, <em>Mná ì bhláth</em> – Gaelic for ‘Women in Bloom’ – was inspired by the women of Ireland’s infamous Magdalene Laundries, a series of church-run forced-labour institutions for the country’s ‘fallen women’. Pierce’s research into the subject proved timely: “Around the time I was creating <em>Mná ì bhláth</em>, Repeal the 8th was happening,” explains Pierce, referencing Ireland’s 2018 referendum on abortion. “I just felt a little let down by the country; women’s rights weren’t at the right level for the 21st century. I really felt like that was why I was making that collection.” In creating <em>Mná ì bhláth</em>, and bringing it abroad – say, to Hyères – Pierce hopes to bring awareness to political issues, past and present, in her native Ireland. It’s also a means of shining a light on the nation’s rich history of craftsmanship and, specifically, honouring the intricate craftwork of the women of the laundries. “Of course the laundries were for cleaning garments. But many people don’t know about the ‘making’ side, the crochet lace, needlepoint, and smocking,” Pierce explains.</p>
<p>The many-layered topic also serves as inspiration for the designer’s Chanel-supported sophomore collection, <em>Bláthanna Fiáin</em> (Gaelic for ‘wildflowers’), which will premiere this week at the 35th Hyères Festival via a series of photographs, film and accompanying book, a collaboration with photographer Andrew Nuding, AnOther’s fashion director Ellie Grace Cumming and art director Simon B Mørch. “This season focuses on the unwed mothers who were sent to the laundries,” explains Pierce. “The title comes from the name the Catholic church gave these women who had children out of wedlock: ‘wildflowers’. They were often wrongly perceived as promiscuous, despite the context in which they may have become pregnant.” Exploring the concept of marriage, of brides, Pierce drew upon wedding dresses and religious garments – communion dresses, even priests’ vestments. “I wanted to bring in more fabrics that were associated with brides: tulles and organzas. Working in these sheer fabrics with last season’s broderie anglaise cotton, blending them because I didn’t want to make completely transparent fabrics.” The resulting garments embody the dualities inherent to the subject matter: between modest and immodest, “innocent and not-so-innocent”, says Pierce. Sweet cotton skirts reveal subtle flashes of skin through sheer slits that open and close as the wearer walks.</p>
<p>“Irishness will always be a part of the label, if it’s from the craft or concept,” continues Pierce. While the designer handcrafts each of her pieces, start-to-finish, in her Dublin-based home studio, she hopes to collaborate with more Irish craftspeople and brands to continue to celebrate the country’s craft heritage. So far, the future looks promising: “For my next project, I’ll be working with very talented Irish lacemakers. I want to develop the crochet lace, to see how it can be done in a new way. That’s something I’m quite excited about and, obviously, it’s very much about Ireland. I find it inspiring, naturally, because it’s deep-rooted in me.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>Why do I want it?</strong> Pierce’s intricate garments are veritable confections: elaborate smocking that resembles perfectly piped icing, “a fresh flower” or “almost a bag that shouldn’t be a bag: a Fabergé bag”, says Pierce with a laugh, describing two pieces from her upcoming S/S21 collection. Beyond that, each Róisín Pierce garment is a show of meticulous craftsmanship. Pierce handcrafts each piece, from start to finish, developing and creating textiles, hand-smocking, patchworking, hand-embroidering, and more, all in her Dublin-based home studio. “In the fabric, I like to create textures that have three-dimensional effects,” she says. In fact, Pierce’s use of an all-white palette is to highlight the intricacies of each garment. “I only work in white,” she says. “It’s for surface. I wear all black myself ... I feel like it’s really lost in the black. Black doesn’t honour the work that goes into the textiles, fully. I feel like white is the way to show all the detail.” Some of Pierce’s more detailed pieces can take up to three weeks to create. “Even when it’s a piece that’s very time-consuming, I want the surface to completely envelop the body, to create a more interesting silhouette from all angles.”</p>
<p>Pierce is also committed to sustainability, keeping her studio zero-waste. “It’s become a lot of what the work is today. A lot of the pieces are made from strips and squares. Some are from scraps, the leftover pieces that were cut awkwardly and turned into something new,” she explains. Keeping her designs waste-free has been challenging, albeit rewarding for the young designer, and has even lead to some innovations in itself. “It’s nice to feel like it’s also pushing the work further because, of course, squares don’t want to turn into a garment or rest on the body. It’s a bit challenging. But I feel like it pushes the work further, which is something I’m always striving for. I really like to embrace and continue to work on it.”</p>
<p><strong>Where can I get it? </strong>Pierce’s pieces are available on a made-to-order basis from <a href="https://www.roisinpierce.com/contact-me">the designer’s website</a>. </p>]]>

<p>For the past 20 years, <strong>Alessandra Sanguinetti</strong> has photographed cousins Guille and Belinda, attracted by their different physiques and evident affection for each other. She met the pair in 1999, while shooting a project on their grandmother’s farm in rural Argentina, and the two girls (then nine years old) were always around, getting into the frame, forcing Sanguinetti to shoo them away. One day, though, she asked them to stay and play. The pictures of Guille and Belinda accumulated until Sanguinetti realised there was a project there.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>In 2003, Sanguinetti published <a href="https://www.ivorypress.com/en/libreria/shop/alessandra-sanguinetti-the-adventures-of-guille-and-belinda-and-the-enigmatic-meaning-of-their-dreams-2/"><em>The Adventures of Guille and Belinda and The Enigmatic Meaning of Their Dreams</em></a>, which chronicles the girls’ relationship over five years as they move from childhood to teenagehood. Rather than taking a traditional, documentary approach to the project, Sanguinetti focused on the girls’ dreams, capturing the melting of imagination and the everyday that happens during child’s play. She was far from a passive observer, however, as she often proposed scenes referencing art history or literature, which the girls adapted and made their own. Childhood was a moment of ambiguity, as Guille and Belinda seamlessly (and often comically) took on the roles of grown-up men and women, Shakespeare’s Ophelia, and the Virgin Mary. </p>
<p>Sanguinetti’s new book, <a href="https://mackbooks.co.uk/products/the-adventures-of-guille-and-belinda-and-the-illusion-of-an-everlasting-summer-br-alessandra-sanguinetti"><em>The Adventures of Guille and Belinda and The Illusion of a Never Ending Summer</em></a>, follows the girls from age 14 to 24 as they shed the remnants of childhood and grow into young adults. You see them playing, studying, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and kissing boys. Some of the images have a dreamlike and carefree quality reminiscent of <a href="/search?q=Ryan+McGinley">Ryan McGinley</a>’s phantasmagoric work, but unlike McGinley’s protagonists, the teenage Guille and Belinda are always brought back to earth, with all its gritty chaos and demands. Belinda becomes a mother at 16, Guille follows soon after.  As the girls get older and take on more responsibilities, play and make-believe fade into the background, forcing Sanguinetti to change her approach to the project. “There was the inevitable awkward stage when I kept thinking of them as children and they asserted themselves as the adolescents and later adults that they were,” she writes by email. “I had to learn to interpret their changes without them being as much accomplices as they had been as children.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402773.jpg" alt="Alessandra Sanguinetti, from The Adventures of Guille and " />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>Taken up by their roles as new mothers, the two girls spend less time with each other. For many commentators, this distancing is inevitably sad, marking the end of an era. For Sanguinetti, it is a bit more complicated. “The passing of time and the changes that occur with it elicit many feelings. I tend to be melancholic, but the overall feeling now is one of sort of embracing it all as it happens. Their distancing is a natural thing that happens when we become adults, but it transforms into another kind of connection.” </p>
<p>This new connection, of two young girls experiencing motherhood at the same time, is hinted at towards the end of the book. You even see glimmers of the girls’ old imagination, as they play with their own children.  Like any good story, you want to know what comes next for the two cousins. Thankfully, Sanguinetti has continued photographing Guille and Belinda. <em>The Adventures of Guille and Belinda </em>will be a trilogy in a few years.</p>

<p>Lucie and Luke Meier, the wife-and-husband design duo at the helm of <strong>Jil Sander</strong>, have revealed their Spring/Summer 2021 collection for the Milan-based fashion house. Presented via a film by Stephen Kidd, the Jil Sander Spring/Summer 2021 collection is about ease and elegance, with close attention paid to craftsmanship, tailoring and timelessness. During uncertain times – and in the midst of a fashion month like no other, full of alternatives to the traditional runway show – the Meiers’ latest collection proposes positivity and elegance.</p>
<p>The film – which features music by Kelsey Lu – sees models walk in what might ordinarily have been a runway show, staged instead without an audience in a vast, concrete-floored space. Since their debut at Jil Sander, Lucie and Luke Meier have honed a structured, sensual purity in their collections, and this “extremely feminine” offering is no different. With considered silhouettes, a pared-back colour palette and varied textures – think buttery leather, sturdy wool, and metal hardware – Jil Sander S/S21 balances different elements. Airy silks are countered with thick-soled leather boots and shoes, earthy tones with gold jewellery, and intricate black crochet pieces with streamlined cream dresses.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Certain pieces were crafted by hand, with crochet, pleats, smocking and embroidery, reflecting how the designers favour intricate workmanship in their collections. Elsewhere accessories are playful: bags are rendered in vibrant, tactile leather and striking black feathers adorn a scarf and pair of earrings.</p>
<p>The ethos of the collection speaks to how recent months have forced people, and the fashion industry, to slow down, and recalibrate. The Meiers propose clothing for life, rooted in beautiful craftsmanship and made to last, keep and treasure. “In today’s atmosphere questions abound, yet beauty and quality remain essential. Consciousness, appreciation, and positivity are what can help us all move forward. The collection celebrates these ideas.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="HrMurCNvWYU"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HrMurCNvWYU" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div>]]>

<p>As one month of lockdown has blurred into the next, the visceral thrill of live performance may feel like a distant memory. Anyone finding themselves in a state of ennui, however, need only head over to the opening rooms of <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2020/event/michael-clark-cosmic-dancer"><strong><em>Cosmic Dancer </em></strong></a>– the newly opened <strong>Michael Clark</strong> retrospective at London’s Barbican – where you’ll find something of a rude awakening.</p>
<p>A constellation of giant screens are arranged at angles in a darkened space, providing a gloriously chaotic showcase of two of Clark’s late-80s “media-dance” masterpieces created in collaboration with <a href="/art-photography/12415/charles-atlas-exhibition-interview-leigh-bowery-michael-clark-merce-cunningham">Charles Atlas</a>, <em>Hail the New Puritan </em>and <em>Because We Must. </em>Clark’s angelic features stare out behind surreal face-painted polka dots or thickly applied red lipstick, his lithe figure wearing a Vivienne Westwood Seditionairies “tits” tee and a tutu, or striking a pose in a flamenco-inspired, crotchless jumpsuit and a pair of graphic Y-fronts. The Fall’s Mark E. Smith, whose jangling post-punk guitars serve as the trippy sonic backdrop to the dancer’s off-kilter ballet moves, appears in one section as a disheveled TV show host. Even Leigh Bowery appears painted in head-to-toe blue; later with his mouth open in a scream, signature stacked glasses across his forehead.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>It makes for a heady nosedive into Clark’s most brash and confrontative works, something that, as the exhibition’s curator Florence Ostende describes it, was very much intentional. “It was about finding ways of encountering the choreography that had nothing to do with the usual or straightforward way you might see it on the performance stage, but instead to present as this kind of immersive collage,” says Ostende of the opening installation, which was created specifically for the exhibition by Atlas.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only real way to tell the story of Clark’s career – with all its meanderings and ups-and-downs – is as something of a collage. The story begins with the boy who grew up a farmer’s son in Aberdeen, before his prodigious talent took him to the Royal Ballet School at the age of 13, where, despite wearing earrings and being caught glue-sniffing, kicking out their star pupil proved out of the question. Turning down an offer to join the company upon graduating, he pivoted to modern dance at Rambert, before quickly finding himself restless there, too.</p>
<p>Then, at the age of just 22, Clark formed his own dance company, where he could fuse the rigour of his multifaceted training with the freewheeling spirit of the underground London nightlife he found himself immersed in. “I think what makes him really special is that he has never rejected his ballet training, or the technical virtuosity of the work,” Ostende adds. “That’s what makes this mix of high and low so particular.” Yet while his work received pearl-clutching responses from the dance establishment – alongside a passionate following among a new generation of dancers seeking to break down the rigid parameters of the medium – for a period in the 90s, Clark all but disappeared. Battling a heroin addiction (and following that, an addiction to the synthetic heroin substitute methadone) he retreated to his mother’s home in rural Scotland to recover. Returning to London towards the end of the decade, he found that, due to missed payments on a storage unit, his archive had been entirely sold off or disposed of.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>It’s this that makes the comprehensive nature of the exhibition all the more remarkable. That so many of these pieces were able to be sourced and put on display once again pays testament to the close bonds Clark established with a head-spinningly broad range of collaborators, all of whom held onto and treasured the fruits of their collective labours. Like the pioneering maestro of dance (and one of Clark’s heroes) before him, Sergei Diaghilev, Clark’s position as a truly groundbreaking figure in the history of dance isn’t the simple collision of classical ballet and punk, but his neverending fascination with the unlikely products of interdisciplinary collaboration. </p>
<p>“I was really interested in shaping the exhibition a bit like a love letter, or at least a compilation of portraits through the eyes of artists and friends and collaborators and heroes that had been revolving and still revolve around Clark’s work,” Ostende explains of the exhibition’s second half, which is divided up with works produced with a variety of these very collaborators, many of whom were closely involved in how they would be staged this time around. A particularly memorable room comes courtesy of Sarah Lucas – who supported Clark during his fallow years by offering him a job gluing cigarette butts to her sculptures – that includes a concrete cast of Clark’s lower half slumped on a toilet; a vision of the ballet dancer’s physique reaching middle age that contains both pathos and an eerie beauty.</p>
<p>There are also plenty of fashion treasures to be found: relics of Clark’s regular collaborations with the cult fashion label BodyMap, whose innovative designs emerged from the clubs alongside Clark’s radical dance performances, as well as glimpses across the videos of pieces by Alexander McQueen and Gucci. (A painting by the artist and club kid Trojan that inspired Atlas’s sets for <em>Hail the New Puritan</em>, meanwhile, was offered for the exhibition by <a href="/search?q=Kim+Jones">Kim Jones</a> from his personal collection.) Nowhere does Clark’s sprawling body of work feel more bracingly contemporary than in his democratic understanding of all forms of creativity, from classical ballet to streetwear design. </p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402752.jpg" alt="14. Michael Clark amp; Company with The Fall in I Am " />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>Part of this resonance with the present moment is more poignant, too. The hopelessness felt by Clark and his first generation of collaborators, and the fiercely political, anarchic artistic spirit that bubbled out of it, was partly the product of working under a right-wing Thatcherite government, whose cynical approach to the creative industries ended up formeting some of the most powerful British art of the 20th century. And despite being many years in the making, the exhibition’s arrival at a moment when funding for the arts is in crisis, with today’s Conservative government recommending workers within the creative sector to “retrain and find other jobs”, feels both profound and timely.</p>
<p>Yet despite these rich (and knowing Clark’s fascination with British history, likely intentional) parallels, where the exhibition feels most vital is where it holds its eye firmly on the future. There may have been an extensive series of live performances planned to accompany the show that have sadly been cancelled, but Clark and the curator’s wish for this inclusive, genre-defying creative universe to provide fertile inspiration to a new generation of creatives doesn’t feel unearned. With the extensive offering of videos on display, many of which have never been on public view before, it’s a world to get lost in – but ultimately, to be influenced by. “We didn’t want this to be an archival exhibition, we wanted to celebrate him as a living artist,” Ostende explains. “It’s about looking forward as well as to the past; about taking the exhibition into a second phase, and seeing it reinterpreted in the eyes of some of the participating artists.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402761.jpg" alt="23. Wolfgang Tillmans, man with clouds, 1998" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>It’s partly for this reason that Clark has refused interviews around the exhibition, preferring to let the work exist as something in its own right. Still, in an interview with Ostende that is reprinted in the exhibition catalogue, Clark says, with typical impish humour: “You are aware that, for me, my work is a matter of life and death?” With <em>Cosmic Dancer</em>, Clark’s extraordinary body of work feels ready to be passed onto the next generation – even as it remains, in its own right, fiercely alive.</p>

<p><em>Introducing <strong><a href="/new-beginnings">New Beginnings</a></strong>, a new series of mini QAs spotlighting emerging designers, in the wake of <a href="/fashion-beauty/12822/cover-story-craig-mcdean-katie-shillingford-emerging-designers-2020">Craig McDean and Katie Shillingford’s shoot</a> for <a href="/tag/another-magazine-autumnwinter-2020">AnOther Magazine Autumn/Winter 2020</a>.</em></p><p><strong>AnOther Magazine: What are your hopes for the future?</strong></p>
<p>Sandra Poulson: I am feeling positive about the future. I have some projects lined up for 2021, which I am already working on, as well as setting up my own studio in London.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What is the thinking behind your work?</strong></p>
<p>SP: My work discusses the political, cultural and socio-economic landscape of Angola as a case study to analyse the relationship between history, oral tradition and global political structures. </p>
<p><strong>AM: What three words would you use to describe your approach to fashion?</strong></p>
<p>SP: Locality, decoloniality and progress.</p>
<p><strong>AM: What does community mean to you?</strong></p>
<p>SP: My understanding of community has had a number of different forms throughout my life. Having grown up in Luanda, lived for a year in Lisbon and now for six years in London, I feel that instead of replacing the communities I belong to, I have accumulated them. </p>
<p><strong>AM: What community did you grow up around? How did that shape you?</strong></p>
<p>SP: I grew up in Luanda, a city where the social and economic disparities are very sharp, but at the same time the culture is very unifying, the communities that raised me as a person were quite diverse. One really important community I felt part of was of the listeners of rap music in Portuguese and Kuduro. Artists suggested by my brother such as Valete, Gabriel o Pensador, Black Company, Bruno M genuinely informed my awareness of the world and my role in it.</p>

<p>Election day in America is looming. On the November 3 – a mere three weeks from now – it will be revealed whether the turmoil of the Trump administration will continue for another term, or a new, more hopeful era will prevail for the Democrats under Joe Biden. It is undoubtedly one of the most crucial elections of our generation, and the fate of the result lies in the hands of just five key swing states: Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona. With the future of the country hanging in the balance, “a small group of artists and friends trying to make a difference” have launched print sale <a href="https://statesofchange.us/"><strong>States of Change</strong></a>, which is raising money to support local groups working on the ground in these vital states to fight voter suppression and to get out the vote.</p>
<p>The sale has seen donations from a staggering 150 artists and, among them, some of the most celebrated names in photography, including Gordon Parks, Larry Sultan, Mario Sorrenti, Nan Goldin, Susan Meiselas, Sally Mann, Carrie Mae Weems, Cindy Sherman, Dawoud Bey, Ed Ruscha, Alec Soth, Catherine Opie, Stephen Shore, Robert Frank, Steve McCurry, Hank Willis Thomas, Kim Gordon, and many more. Running until this Sunday (October 18), each print in the sale is 10 x 12 inches and is priced at $150.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>States of Change is organised alongside the <a href="https://movement.vote/">Movement Voter Project</a>, which has selected 42 of the most impactful local community-based organisations working in the five key swing states to send proceeds to. With a focus on young people and communities of colour, Movement Voter Project works to strengthen progressive power at all levels of government by helping donors – big and small – support local community-based organisations to get out the vote, fight voter suppression, and galvanise communities to build infrastructures that will lead to lasting change. “We support hundreds of incredible organisations that both turn out unlikely voters and organise communities to grow their power and create transformation, from policy to the streets. We believe that supporting local movement vote groups is the most effective and most cost-effective strategy to transform our country,” say Movement Voter Project. </p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“In this short period of time before the election, groups are working on everything from early vote education and mobilisation to polls protection to fighting voter disenfranchisement,” the team behind States of Change explains of the objectives of the sale. On what drove them to action, organisers say, “there’s the prevailing sense that the country and our democracy are spinning out of control, and that we are powerless to stop it. We didn’t want to become resigned to a sense of darkness and had to act. Inspired by the change artists made with the <a href="/art-photography/12430/pictures-for-elmhurst-photography-hospital-queens-covid-19-brianna-capozzi">Pictures for Elmhurst</a> project, we decided to band together again to support these amazing non-profits. Every dollar we donate will make a real and direct impact on voter turnout.”</p>

<p>A beauty magazine through the eyes of subculture. That’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alteredstatesmagazine/"><strong><em>Altered States</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>
<p>“Our ethos is cultural innovation and authenticity, it’s at the forefront of every creative that we produce,” says Editor-in-Chief Michael Harding, a session stylist who moved to London from Vancouver 15 years ago and styles hair for the likes of Dazed and Another Man. Co-founded with Fashion Director Hannah Elwell, <em>Altered States </em>was realised through lockdown as the couple prepared for another arrival: their now eight week-old son, Phoenix, who the magazine is dedicated to.</p>
<p>Titled <em>Appreciation</em>, the first issue is an energetic mix of people doing their thing, with photographers including Samuel Bradley, Will Scarborough, Daniel Ciufo, Josh Hight and Emily Lipson.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Katsu Naito has reprinted his iconic early-90s documentary of Meatpacking District streetwalkers, <em>West Side Rendezvous</em>. And there’s a story from hair artist Bob Recine, who, as a young punk met Andy Warhol and was introduced to Jean Louis David by the soup-erstar.</p>
<p>“Another documentary we’ve featured is <em>The Russians</em> by Nathan Farb,” shares Harding. “Nathan travelled to the Soviet Union and photographed over 500 people during the Cold War for the American Intelligence Agency. Those pictures, taken in 1977, are very relevant in a beauty sense because of the hair, the way they were photographed in portrait style and the lighting, which is very modern. We wanted to be more of a research-based beauty magazine and want people to see a continuity between the content we’re producing and the content we’re including that’s archival.”</p>
<p>Esteemed hairstylist (and Dazed contributing beauty editor) Gary Gill is interviewed, revealing how music shaped his outlook. Clare Shilland, meanwhile, was commissioned to photograph queer skaters in Hackney.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“I’ve been a skateboarder my whole life, so the story with Clare was important,” says Harding. “Are the LGBTQ community being supported enough? It’s only recently, maybe the last five years, the skateboarding industry has been more inclusive. It was interesting speaking to the spectrum of ages and sexualities, how they identified.</p>
<p>“The sincerity of DIY, build, skate and destroy, that mentality, is what it’s always been about. A bunch of people coming together, passionate about the same thing.”</p>
<p>“Our magazine isn’t for people that just care about eyeliner and hairspray,” he declares. “Hopefully issue two will be further impressive; we’ll work even harder because everyone seems happy with it. I don’t want to let them down.”</p>

<p>American photographer <strong>Brian Hamill</strong> has spent over 50 years garnering acclaim as both a photojournalist and a still photographer on seminal movie sets (<em>Annie Hall, The Conversation, A Woman Under the Influence</em>). Much to his delight, the avid rock’n’roll fan also had the opportunity to meet and photograph <strong>John Lennon</strong> – once while performing what would be his final concert in Madison Square Gardens in 1972, and twice on portrait assignments at Lennon and <strong>Yoko Ono</strong>’s New York homes.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>As with all Hamill’s work, his images of the Beatle and his artist wife – newly published in a photo book titled <a href="https://www.accartbooks.com/us/book/dream-lovers-john-and-yoko-in-nyc/"><em>Dream</em><em> Lovers</em></a> – are masterfully composed and wonderfully candid. “I’m a straightforward guy,” he explains over the phone in a gruff, warm Brooklyn accent. “I grew up one of seven kids in an Irish, working-class neighbourhood and we had to be. Plus I do a minimal amount of direction – when it’s a journalistic look, I find it best to let people do their thing and shoot away.”</p>
<p>In Lennon and Ono’s case, that thing was lounging companionably in their apartments, which we get a satisfyingly in-depth look at; walking the streets of the West Village in matching outfits, and watching the world go by from their rooftops. Here – almost exactly coinciding with what would have been Lennon’s 80th birthday – Hamill recalls the very memorable experiences of capturing his favourite Beatle on film.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“I first photographed John in person on October 13, 1972. And I was nervous! I’d been doing photojournalism for around seven years, so I was confident in my own craft abilities, but it was a big deal. John Lennon was my favourite Beatle.</em></p>
<p><em>“When I rang the bell of their Bank Street apartment, I announced my name and John’s voice said, ‘Come on up’. I was shocked: on movie shoots, you have assistants, the whole entourage, but he answered the door himself! </em></p>
<p><em>“The first thing he said to me was, ‘Hello Brian, I’m John. Would you like a cuppa?’ I looked around the apartment to see where ‘Team Lennon’ was, but the only one in there was Yoko. </em></p>
<p><em>“They were both exceedingly nice, and had such humanity. When we went out on the streets, they never made themselves seem more important than the people who stopped them to say hello. John had a built-in humour and he got a big chuckle from everyone he talked to, including me.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“He made me feel just as relaxed when I photographed him alone at the Dakota, three years later. The only fuck up I made then was when I asked him to pose in front of his jukebox. He put on </em>What’s Going On<em> by Marvin Gaye and afterward I said, ‘This is the most inventive album of the 70s so far’. Then I thought, ‘Oh shit, what did I just say to John Lennon?’ The guy had put out some really good records that decade, including the </em>Plastic/Ono<em> album! There was the hint of a pregnant pause and then he goes, ‘I agree. It’s a great fookin’ album!’</em></p>
<p><em>“We went up onto the roof again and he had a cool-looking jacket on with an Elvis pin – he told me Elvis got him into rock and roll – and an oversized French beret. It was very windy and his hair was blowing all over the place. I asked if he wanted to stop but he said, ‘Do your thing, I don’t care!’ He was the opposite of the actors I’d shot, who were always looking in mirrors: he was a rock and roller, a transplanted New Yorker.</em></p>
<p><em>“My favourite picture is of John and Yoko looking at the Hudson river. They’re both in profile and John’s got his hand on her left shoulder. They had matching dark clothing on – they were like sidekicks. It was a magical moment.</em></p>
<p><em>“My other favourite is a tableau taken on the rooftop of the Dakota. Over his left shoulder is where the Strawberry Fields memorial in Central Park is now, ironically, so it’s kind of foreboding but I like the graphics.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong> and <strong>Andreas Kronthaler</strong> are kindred spirits, kind spirits – idealists united in their pursuit of a better world. That, of course, also unites them with Vivienne Westwood – possibly the most politically active fashion designer of the past half-century.</p>
<p>Anderson, likewise, has tirelessly wielded her celebrity for environmental – and more recently, social and political – causes. Since achieving pin-up status in the late 80s and early 90s, modelling in Playboy and acting in Baywatch, she has become as much of a force off screen as on. A committed vegan, she has championed animal rights for more than 20 years, including as a poster girl for Peta since 1997, and most recently campaigned with the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, a direct action marine conservation group, among other organisations.</p>
<p>Kronthaler met Westwood in 1988 while he was studying – and she was teaching, as a visiting professor of fashion – at the University of Applied Arts Vienna. He followed Westwood back to London, where they fell in love. Kronthaler has been working alongside Westwood since 1990, initially as her assistant and latterly as creative director of the main line, which Westwood passed on to him and added his name to in 2016. They married in 1993 and together they form one of fashion’s most extraordinary pairings.</p>
<p>The links between this Austrian fashion designer and Canadian-American polymath actress-model-activist go beyond Anderson’s legendarily pneumatic silhouette – which does, indeed, find ample reflection in Kronthaler’s tailoring, and has been featured in both the label’s advertising campaigns and shows. They first met in the south of France many years ago but formed their friendship in 2008, in a trailer park in Malibu, California, on the shoot for a Vivienne Westwood campaign. When they speak now, Kronthaler is in his studio in London, while Anderson is holed up in a sunny hideaway somewhere along the Canadian coastline. In an exchange that’s both “intimate” and “sexy” – Anderson’s words – they catch up on everything, from life over the past six months to their respective journeys in activism and what it means to live romantically.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>Zoom conversation between Pamela Anderson and Andreas Kronthaler, July 2020.</em></p>
<p><strong>Pamela Anderson:</strong> So, are we interviewing each other? Let’s keep it sexy. When did we first meet?</p>
<p><strong>Andreas Kronthaler:</strong> I remember very well. We were arranging a photoshoot in Los Angeles – it was a long time ago, it was actually the day that Barack Obama was voted in, or a couple of days before. We were driving down to Malibu, where you lived in this trailer park. We didn’t know what to expect. You just said, “Come along and let’s shoot around my trailer.” We got there, called you up and you came down this little hill in a white golf cart. You looked incredible. I’ll never forget it. You were in a man’s vest and that was all you wore, really.</p>
<p><strong>PA: </strong>Well, yes, I don’t wear much ...</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Just this big, baggy man’s vest, and I was like, “Gargh!”</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> I’m wearing this old slip now – I don’t like clothes, you know me.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Anyway, we spent nearly a week there and it was just an incredibly beautiful experience.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> And Obama was voted in and we were so excited.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> It was a very big moment. It was a moment of hope.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> And then we lost hope ... </p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> We have to find it again.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

    </section>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> Yes, we have to find it again. Who’s going to help us with that? Not America, I don’t think.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> We have to help each other and do it ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> That’s right ... So that’s how I met you. But I met Vivienne long before that.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> No, I actually met you as well, and this was a really long time ago, in the south of France. We were at dinner and you walked into the room and Vivienne asked you to sign a petition for Leonard Peltier [the American Indigenous rights activist imprisoned after a controversial 1977 trial. His conviction has been the subject of much contention; Amnesty International, Nelson Mandela, Mother Teresa and the Dalai Lama have all campaigned for clemency]. She was campaigning to get him out of prison. You whisked by – I remember very well – in a totally transparent dress.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> What’s wrong with me? Totally transparent.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Anyway, you immediately signed this petition and then you started to talk to Vivienne a bit.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> I still campaign for Leonard. I still don’t think he should be in prison, even though people found out more things about that time. I still talk to him. It’s such a terrible thing.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> [He has been in now for] I don’t know how long.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> I feel a lot of the time with activism, especially with celebrities, it becomes more about the celebrity than the actual cause. Everybody knows my point of view – I’m trying to come from another place. I’m always active but less visibly active, which I think is less annoying to people.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Sometimes as well, Pamela, you don’t really preach to the convinced ones.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> I want to do things that actually make a difference, like give money to people on the front lines – less, “Look at me, look at me, this is what I believe.” It’s actually been really successful in helping people. More so now than ever. Not so much me being the poster child for things.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Yes, but we need to see you every now and again. I’m not sure if I’m an activist. I’ve got causes I care about but I try to stay in the background. But one time, when I was 16 or 17 years old, they wanted to open a nuclear power station. We lay in front of this power station for a week or two and they didn’t open it. And they’re still without nuclear energy, Austria, [nearly] 40 years later. It wasn’t violent, it was peaceful, but it made a difference.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>PA:</strong> When I was young, this was my first action. My father was hunting and he came home and he told me not to go into the pump house, so of course that’s the first place I went. And I saw a dead deer hanging upside down, dripping into a bucket of blood. That made me realise what meat is, so I stopped eating it and convinced him not to hunt. Then, when I started <em>Baywatch</em>, I had to share this meaningless attention with something more important, otherwise I’d feel like I’m living a meaningless life. So I started working with animal charities. I saw how it worked and thought, what else can I do? [Now I work with] all these different people that I’ve met, and I have my foundation that I fund and get funding for and give it to people on the front line – like Paul Watson [the Canadian-American environmental activist who founded the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]. You don’t always have to be on the front page of everything to make a difference.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> He’s a good writer, Paul Watson, he’s super-brilliant.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> He knows a lot, that’s for sure. The oceans are responsible for most of the oxygen we breathe and we’re just killing them. Humans are terrible. Not my favourite species. I like my kids, I like my friends, but that’s it. I shouldn’t say that, there are good people out there. Human beings are incredible, too, but it’s just disappointing. Gobbling up everything. That means myself as well. I’m disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I work very closely in a team which is like a community. I think if everyone knows their role in it, it can be something very powerful and very positive if the cause is right.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> It can be very powerful. I want to see you, Andreas. I miss you guys, it’s been so long. Sometimes this all feels like an illusion, like time is an illusion – it feels like I saw you yesterday. And you know, you’re always making fun of me for being naked, but you’re naked a lot, too. I’ve seen you in lots of transparent garments.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> Me neither. You once looked at Vivienne and me and said, “You are the two most difficult women to dress.” [Laughs.] I love what Vivienne’s been wearing lately – I know you’re dressing her and she looks fabulous. I guess there are still collections coming out, but there’s no show? </p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> We have done the summer collection – I actually finished it before lockdown. But there will be no show because it doesn’t make sense. It’s just too risky. Let’s see in the new year. We’ll have to think of something else but I’m a bit wary of it because, I don’t know, these films ...</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> You and Juergen will figure something out, right? Does he do film, too?</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Yes, he does. He does it with his iPhone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We were driving down to Malibu, where you lived in this trailer park. We got there, called you up and you came down this little hill in a white golf cart. You looked incredible. I’ll never forget it. You were in a man’s vest and that was all you wore, really” – Andreas Kronthaler</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> You can do everything with your iPhone.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Another thing, Pamela, is that no one is having any social events, so of course they don’t need to dress up as they used to. For the parties … </p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> Or even weddings – people are doing Zoom weddings.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Just two people, no fun. Are you thinking of marrying again?</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> No. Maybe. One more time, why not?</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> How many times have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> Three.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> That’s not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> Nope. Fourth time’s the charm. We just have to live our lives, right? I’m a romantic. This time I’ll wear a Vivienne dress. Or a dress by Andreas – what am I saying? It’ll be a bikini and a veil. No, I’m kidding. It’s actually very hot here right now.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I’ve never been to Canada before, you know.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>PA:</strong> No? When you come here you have to quarantine for two weeks, they’re very strict about it. I have California plates on my car and a man came up to my car and banged on the window and told me to go back. He called me a Yankee and told me to go home. I think the stress of this is going to have more impact than anything else. We’re all living with a little bit of a stomach ache. It’s great for artists to put a stamp on this time. We have to depend on them to make sense of it all. I can’t make sense of anything.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I haven’t read one line of a book.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> No reading? That’s funny, you read a lot.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I tried starting a book but stopped after 30 pages. I don’t know why. I did gardening, cooking and cleaning. I love cleaning. I’m a bit house-proud.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> But that’s what you have to do, it’s like meditation.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> It was a break, a break that was forced onto you. And I needed it. I realise that now. We had been doing shows and collections for 30 years. Like a hamster on a wheel. And suddenly the wheel stopped.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> That’s the good part, it made everybody stop.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: For a second.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> For the foreseeable. Everybody is waiting for the world to get back to the regular way, but I don’t think it will. This time has taught me that we have too much stuff.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I’ve learnt to be more in the moment. To appreciate what you have and what’s around you. I thought people were really sweet – the contacts I had in this time were really sweet and positive.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> More intimate. We’re all in this together.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> We’re all in this together. That is a very special thing. And now of course, we’re in London. It’s a huge city and it’s all getting back to normal. It’s getting busy, congested and noisy.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> But in Austria, what’s it like there?</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> We stay in this house – my brother, he’s a farmer, he’s got a house up in the mountains, so it’s really remote. It’s heaven.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> I feel like this is heaven here. I’m so happy to see your face – and moving, instead of just a picture on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> I should post more of myself.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> More naked pictures. You and Vivienne are a great couple. You’re talented, funny, sexy and perfect. Sometimes people ask me, do I worry about what people think? And I say, well, the people I admire love me, so it doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks. Vivienne and Andreas like me.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> That’s what counts. You are a force of nature and a very kind person, too. I mean, there is all the exterior but there is the interior as well. What impressed me very much is what a wonderful mother you are. In this trailer park, when you had the boys there – this was a long time ago, they were still teenagers – you were so special to them and you educated them so well.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> Somehow they survived and turned into incredible boys, so that’s a great compliment, thank you. This has been a sexy interview, an intimate interview. That’s what sexiness means to me – being engaged in the world, as we say, the romantic struggle. Living romantically is living with empathy, being vulnerable, taking risks, being a pioneer, living on the edge, not following a formula, being a little more brave with your decisions. You never feel bad if you do something crazy, wild and sexy. I mean, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>AK:</strong> Neither do I. I never regret it.</p>
<p><strong>PA:</strong> No, you can’t regret anything. No regrets. I’m so happy to see you. Kiss Vivienne for me.</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>Sparked by the protests and a global reckoning with the systemic racism that penetrates our society, <em><strong>PLATFORM</strong></em> was born out of a need and a desire to take action. Already having a good relationship with Judith Watt, fashion historian and Fashion Journalism course leader at Central Saint Martins, Christopher and Tammy Kane set about working with Watt and students with diverse, inclusive and engaging perspectives within fashion, culture and the world at large.</p>
<p><em>PLATFORM</em> is the result of this collaborative effort. A monthly digital zine that riffs on <em>The F Word</em> (the students’ monthly magazine) is broadcast onto Christopher Kane’s main Instagram account. The students have full access, control and support from Christopher Kane and his team.</p>
<p>“In collaboration with the BAME students from Central Saint Martins’ BA Fashion Journalism, Fashion Communication  Promotion and the team behind <em>The F Word</em> magazine, <em>PLATFORM</em> is here to support young Black creatives and ethnic minorities within the fashion community through action. For as long as we can remember, inequality, discrimination and under-representation have been at the heart of the elitist fashion industry. It is time that ‘cancel-culture’ stopped overshadowing the voices of those doing some good, and that attention is placed on celebrating the diverse and inclusive talents paving the way for future generations,” say its members.</p>
<p>Here, we catch up with Hannah Karpel and Yelena Grelet, the co-editors, to discuss all things <em>PLATFORM</em> and the future of fashion journalism.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><strong>C L Mayers: How did the collaboration with Christopher Kane come about and what are its intentions?<br /></strong></p>
<p>Hannah Karpel: We were approached by Christopher and Tammy Kane to lead this project through our tutor and course leader of BA Fashion Journalism at Central Saint Martins, Judith Watt. The Kanes have been good friends with Judith for a long time and have also been supporting students on our course through PR internships over the years. Following the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by George Floyd’s death, Christopher and Tammy knew they wanted to do something to support young BAME fashion students. In comparison to opportunities for fashion design students, there is very little that goes to young fashion journalists, particularly those who are BAME. The intention of <em>PLATFORM</em> became an opportunity to celebrate the work of young BAME fashion journalists coming together to edit and produce a digital publication without any limitations. </p>
<p><strong>CLM: What are your own personal objectives for <em>PLATFORM</em> and why is it important to you as young people?</strong></p>
<p>HK: I hope to continue celebrating exceptional creative people within the fashion industry who are actively making a change and using their individuality as their asset. I want to keep <em>PLATFORM</em> honest. The conversations we have with those we interview should challenge and question. You never know what you may discover or who you may inspire. Perspectives are key. The world is so much bigger and more beautiful than you think, and if you can listen to someone else and understand a part of their experience and culture, then you can start to truly appreciate life.</p>
<p>Yelena Grelet: While as a fashion journalism student I can share my writing, my objective is to also share the works of others in hopes of them receiving wider exposure. I have felt so passionate and connected to <em>PLATFORM</em> as a young aspiring fashion journalist to have my voice be heard and be given this opportunity during such bleak times where many, particularly young students, are currently struggling.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>CLM: What type of content should we be expecting from <em>PLATFORM</em> and on <em>The F Word</em>?</strong></p>
<p>HK: The way we have come to summarise <em>The F Word</em> is as ‘Young Voices, New Attitudes’. Each issue of <em>The F Word</em> is based on a different ‘F’ word. This one is appropriately named ‘Furious’, because, well ... we are. Written by both students and alumni from our BA Fashion Journalism course, we share the opinion of many in similar situations. Due to the pandemic, unemployment rates have rocketed and it’s not like we can go and drown our sorrows in the club or get drunk at a house party. It has been an infuriating time. The graduate students not only completed their degrees in lockdown but now they don’t get a graduation and more importantly, don’t have a job waiting for them. Expect investigation, criticality, objectivity, broadcast and a whole lot of dark humour – because boy do we need it.</p>
<p><strong>CLM: As young people working towards graduation and entering the industry, are you excited or are things daunting? Why?</strong></p>
<p>YG: Hannah and I are both on our placement years and have been lucky enough to be able to focus on <em>PLATFORM</em> and not have to worry so much about internships. However, I would be lying if I said that I wasn’t worried about finding a post-graduate job not only as a young female graduate but as a female graduate of colour. I prefer to remain optimistic and hope that the fashion industry will create and offer many more opportunities for the younger generation.</p>
<p>HK: It’s bloody terrifying! I look at our friends who have just graduated and left with no job and thousands of pounds of debt and surprisingly that doesn’t appeal to me very much. Of course, I cannot wait to finally be working on live projects, to see my writing and work in print and to meet new people and collaborate but I would be lying if I said everything felt hunky-dory.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>CLM: What do you think is missing in fashion right now and what do we have too much of?</strong></p>
<p>YG: What’s missing is authenticity within the fashion industry. We’re lacking a diverse mixture of talented and forward-thinkers from different ethnic backgrounds, sexualities et cetera. It isn’t an accurate reflection of the times we’re currently living in.</p>
<p>HK: I think fashion has a class problem. We all know it is very elitist but this all boils down to opportunities. The unpaid internships have got to go. Only those who can afford to work full time unpaid will apply for the internship and therefore, only they will get the job, excluding an entire group of talented people who simply cannot afford that foot in the door. </p>
<p><strong>CLM: How can the industry better serve those who are not afforded equal opportunities?</strong></p>
<p>HK: Look beyond the recommendation of your colleague’s daughter. I think because of how much students want a job at the moment that employers know if one person won’t work unpaid for a month that they can easily find someone else who will but this is my point. Employers should be willing to mentor students when they start, listen to them. Where are you advertising? Are you already closing the door because you are only opening it to one limited group? In my opinion, opportunities start in school. So many kids don’t know half the jobs that are available in the fashion industry and what they would need to do to get there. </p>
<p><strong>CLM: What is the future of fashion journalism?</strong></p>
<p>YG: Whether it’s print or digital, fashion journalism will always be here to stay. As we’re living in the digital age, many feel like influencers are dominating the realm of fashion but fashion journalists hold the power of being great storytellers and critical writers. That is what is keeping fashion journalism alive and exciting.</p>
<p>HK: The future of fashion journalism is a very exciting one. During this apocalyptic time, it is clear how fashion journalists have come together to support each other and adapt. Fashion journalism itself is exactly that, adaptable. From how we live to how we dress, there are so many layers and ways to execute this. I do believe fashion journalism is changing. In my opinion, it starts with the young writers on <em>The F Word</em> and <em>PLATFORM</em> but I would say that!</p>]]>

<p>On April 26, 1986, six weddings took place in Pripyat, Ukraine. All five of the city’s schools were open and children played in puddles in the street once dismissed from their classes. As researcher and author Darmon Richter writes in FUEL’s latest book <strong><em>Chernobyl: A Stalkers’ Guide</em></strong>, at precisely 01:23:40 that morning, what should have been a routine test of Chernobyl Power Station’s Reactor 4 went seriously wrong, and the resulting catastrophe tore a hole in the fabric of the Soviet Union so large that the regime would fray away to nothing just five years later. Aware only of an undisclosed incident at the power plant, and not of its unprecedented and still unrivalled severity, the people of a doomed city carried on as normal until they were eventually given just two hours to evacuate, with the promise that they would return just three days later, but they never did.</p>
<p>Founded on February 4, 1970, Pripyat was what the Soviets called an ‘atomgrad’ – an atomic city, dedicated to nuclear power – and for a few hours in April 1986, its past and present existed in parallel. The gaping chasm between Pripyat: the Soviet Union’s ninth atomgrad and Pripyat: Ukrainian ghost city was momentarily sealed by the delay between the occurrence of a deadly nuclear incident and those in charge deciding what to do next. It is worth observing that where propaganda and crisis collide there will always be a notable pause – a reluctance to act – in which a regime will decide whether to save itself or its people.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>As Richter states in the opening line of his new book, “There are two Chernobyls: a place, and an event”. In <em>Chernobyl: A Stalkers’ Guide</em>, he journeys into the contemporary Exclusion Zone, venturing deeper than any previously published account, documenting the findings of his exploration through arresting photography and a story-teller’s account of the communities that have, and continue to, exist within it. “This is a book about a mythopoetic landscape that authors, artists and filmmakers had been dreaming of long before the Chernobyl disaster itself had happened,” he writes. “It is therefore a study of Chernobyl not as a dead zone where history was suddenly halted in 1986, but as a new Eden populated by scientists, settlers and scrap-metal thieves; where hordes of tourists come by day to explore a living memorial to the fragility of civilisation; and where ‘stalkers’ conduct their own nocturnal quests: rites of passage born from a blend of post-Soviet counter-culturalism, sci-fi escapism, and perhaps a yearning for spiritualistic self-discovery.”</p>
<p>Just as the name Chernobyl has become synonymous with death, catastrophic failure and inescapable tragedy, the architectural and graphic aesthetics of the Soviet era are more often than not the evident starting point for production designers who want to communicate a culture of militant control or dystopian unease. As Richter explains, “Cinema did not predict Chernobyl, but it did a lot to prepare a place for it in the public consciousness”. Popular culture and audiences hungry for any glimpse into the possible futures of a world now in throes of rapid technological advancement were enchanted by books such as Aldous Huxley’s <em>Brave New World</em>, George Orwell’s <em>1984</em> and Philip K. Dick’s <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em> – which would be reimagined as Ridley Scott’s iconic 1982 film <em>Blade Runner</em> – and the leaders of the Soviet Union knew they had to limit their population’s exposure to any materials that may inspire people to question the motives or legitimacy of the regime.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>While many authors, journalists and filmmakers were silenced by the regime, some seemed to evade complete censorship. Throughout <em>Chernobyl: A Stalkers’ Guide</em>, Richter refers back to popular culture and how it both predicted and mirrored the absurdities of societal evolution and oppression. <em>Roadside Picnic</em>, written by brothers Boris and Arkady Strugatsky and published in 1972, was not the first science-fiction novel to imagine a hostile wasteland populated with unnatural dangers, but it was one of very few on the matter to be published in the USSR. As Richter explains, “The Soviet cultural policy under Stalin had permitted only near-future science fiction – works that commented directly and literally on the tangible achievements of Soviet science – but relative liberalisation under the Khrushchev regime, combined with the new confidence bought by the growing prestige of the USSR’s post-Gagarin space programme, permitted the Strugatskys to look a little further afield.” Despite being published 14 years before the Chernobyl disaster, the novel reads as a chilling prophecy. In 1979, Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky released <em>Stalker</em>, a film based on <em>Roadside Picnic</em>. The film focuses on its protagonist’s highly dangerous journey into the central zone of the untouched wasteland, not unlike the illegal hike to the heart of Chernobyl’s Exclusion Zone documented by Richter himself.</p>

<p>Surfing is among things that dreams are made of: who wouldn’t want to ride a wave in crystalline, turquoise waters, under the warm sun of Tavarua, Uluwatu or Tamarindo? However, surf aesthetics – and, by extension, surf culture – can be an exclusive sport. Imagining a surfer almost invariably means mentally picturing a white, blonde conventionally attractive and heterosexual man. For decades, surf magazines have perpetuated that ideal, disseminating imagery that featuring scantily clad – yet unequivocally straight – men spending their days together, riding surfboards with names like “Penetrator”, chugging beers and checking out faceless, almost entirely nude women.</p>
<p>Like most young surfers, <strong>Stephen Milner</strong> grew up fascinated by those images, yet simultaneously feeling alienated by them. A San Diego-based artist and surfer, Milner was interested in pro skimboarding before getting serious about surfing. “I remember being so impressed by the men in the community, and at the same time thinking how freeing it was to spend time at the beach, where I could hide my male-on-male gaze behind sunglasses, and use surfing as a sort of masculinity cloak.” As a teenager, he collected surf and skateboard magazines, but hid gay porn between their pages. “It was the one place where I knew no one would look,” he says. “I knew I was gay but I wasn’t out yet. It’s funny because in a way I was using surfing to be more straight-acting, but surfing was also this kind of queer dream, where you’d meet a guy in the water, and you’d be the only two people out, striking a conversation and surfing against the setting sun … ” For years, Milner inwardly reflected on what it means to be gay in the surfing world, yet never knew how to articulate those thoughts. Until a few years ago, when he started creating collages mixing pictures from vintage surfing magazines and gay porn magazines, thus queering a historically straight narrative.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>His images have now been turned into <em>A Spiritual Good Time</em>, a book uncovering the dialogue between surfing communities and queer culture, and exploring gay identity through tight cropping, editing and re-contextualising the editorial tropes of surf photography. A few weeks before the book’s publication, Milner tells us the story behind his artwork and reflects on surfing tradition, inclusion and his own experience within the community.</p>
<p><em>“I grew up in New York, near Long Island Sound, a 30-minute drive away from the ocean, so I started skimboarding and messing around with surfing as a kid, but I wasn’t serious about it until I went to college. At around 19 I got my first longboard. At the time, I was an undergrad in art school and started toying with the idea of becoming a surf photographer, but I soon realised it wasn’t for me: I just couldn’t relate to the kind of surfing community you see in magazines, with its male on female gaze, its hypermasculinity, its sense of brotherhood … Somehow, I had always been a part of that yet I never felt like my true self. Deep down, I was hoping one day I’d find a group of gay surfers to be buddies and travel with, my kind of community.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><em>“It was around that time that I came out to my friends.</em> <em>I’m straight-passing so I've been lucky to never be scared in the line-up, but I never felt comfortable with being outspoken when, for instance, I heard homophobic slurs in the line-up, because I didn’t want to be outed in the water and become a target. People often don’t understand that surfing can have this toxic quality: the localism, the masochism … Deep down, I think it stems from wanting to protect a tradition, whether it’s a territory, an identity, a view of masculinity … But that masculinity is so fragile! In a way, that fascinates me.</em></p>
<p><em>“I had an epiphany while watching Bruce Brown’s </em>The Endless Summer<em>, which is the ultimate surf movie, filmed in 1965, about two surfers searching for the perfect wave. I remember thinking those two guys should definitely be gay, travelling and surfing together, just pretending they’re interested in women. It was so easy to turn the narrative on its head, to just take out the part where they go to Australia and the whole theme is obsessing over girls. I started thinking about that, wondering how I could flip the narrative with things that already exist, things that were declared tradition through surfing images. I started visiting surf shops and asking for vintage magazines. Looking at them, the [lack of] diversity became pretty clear. There were some recurring tropes, like the guy in a group on the beach, talking. I sliced all those little pieces, blowing them up to obtain that nostalgia quality, and once I lined up a bunch of those together, a queer narrative started forming. At the same time, I was collecting gay porn for a different project. Funnily enough, there are some images of surfers in those mags too, and I began mixing both.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“My artwork was never primarily meant for a surf audience, but for an art audience. However, </em>Surfer Magazine<em> took an interest in the book and published an interview a couple weeks ago. The amount of attention and hate mail I got was insane; I ended up having to turn my phone off for a couple of days. But I also had a lot of loving responses and amazing community building, especially from queer, women and non-white surfers. Basically, the people who don’t fit the stereotype of what the world thinks a surfer should be like and look like. It’s time to flip that narrative, for good.”</em></p>

<p>For <a href="/tag/another-magazine-autumnwinter-2020">AnOther Magazine Autumn/Winter 2020</a>, photographer <a href="/user/CraigMcDean">Craig McDean</a> and stylist and AnOther Magazine fashion director <a href="/user/KatieShillingford">Katie Shillingford</a> collaborated on <a href="/fashion-beauty/12822/cover-story-craig-mcdean-katie-shillingford-emerging-designers-2020">a shoot celebrating emerging designers</a>, starring the sublime South Sudanese-Australian model Adut Akech.</p>
<p>Titled <strong><em>The Wand of Youth</em></strong>, the shoot is accompanied by a film, premiered here, which brings the work of these brilliant designers to life – from Stephanie Uhart’s knitted feather yarn dress to Tolu Coker’s appliquéd upcycled-leather jacket, featuring her late father Kayode Coker, who was involved in fighting for equitable justice for marginalised communities, and Angela Davis – a garment which appears on a cover of the magazine.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“I knew people would question and ask about the prints and the people in them as they are really dominant and stand out,” said Coker of her approach to fashion. “I use clothing to spark important conversations. This is at the forefront of my mind every time I design or create.”</p>
<p>“This look is called ‘Obsessive Comfort’ and it aims to emulate the feeling of seeking comfort and hiding within yourself,” said Uhart, meanwhile, of her purple-coloured creation. “The soft and fluffy texture seemed like an ideal way to evoke that emotion. It’s deeply personal because every look in the collection represents an emotional stage that I went through while making the collection in lockdown.”</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>“I made what is now <em>Corner of My Sky</em>, which was entitled <em>Mushroom</em> for a while … I’ll just leave that there,” laughs <strong>Kelly Lee Owens</strong>, whose name translates as ‘warrior’ in Gaelic. Her masterful second album <em>Inner Song</em>, spanning dream-pop and techno, is definitely magic.</p>
<p>“I just knew that I needed <strong>John Cale</strong>’s voice, that’s what had to happen,” she continues. The legendary musician was drawn to lay down a vocal exploring his Welsh heritage; a poetry of the land channelled through distant memory. To have Cale singing in Welsh on <em>Corner of My Sky</em> is special. Not only for Owens, who grew up in Rhuddlan, Flintshire, but because Cale, from Garnant, the Amman Valley is so associated with New York, having moved to the US in the early 60s to complete his classical training, guided by Aaron Copeland.</p>
<p>Owens first met Cale in London several years ago, when she was featuring on one of his own songs. His deeply commanding voice still retains its Welsh cadence: impressively so. While on the page, he aligns to the American school of spelling – ‘or’ over ‘our’ in humour, colour, and whatever else.</p>
<p>Sitting front and centre through life’s sharp turns, there is the sense that both figures truly embrace what is in front of them: Cale has famously. For years as a teenager Owens was a nurse, first at a nursing home then at a cancer hospital in Manchester, a city she was drawn to exclusively for its gigs.</p>
<p>“I didn’t like the way that education was presented to me,” Owens says. “My first love is music but your career adviser says, ‘That’s nice, but what else do you want to do?’ I quit my studies and, me being practical, crossed the road from my high school, to a nursing home. I thought, ‘If I’m going to do nursing I need to know if I can deal with death.’ I was holding people’s hands and talking them through their death. It would be very intuitive as to what I felt I needed to do to allow that person to feel safe and that they were not alone.”</p>
<p>Buoyed by those around her to ultimately follow her passion, she threw herself in at the deep end and moved to London, interning at XL Records and working at record shops including Pure Groove. It was meeting fellow staffer Daniel Avery – and being in the studio with him – that had her open the throttle on her own artist-producer career. Her expression came pouring out.</p>
<p><em>Inner Song</em>, mastered direct to vinyl, is a sesquialbum, or a triple-sided LP because Owens was determined to keep her recordings’ space and punch. She even remarks that, zoomed in, vinyl grooves resemble the Grand Canyon: it doesn’t get more huge and elemental than that. No wonder Björk called for a remix (released in 2018). Through Owens’ songwriting, she unleashes her spirit; overwhelming, shifting humanity behind these flashing machines.</p>
<p>Cale, through his rigour and imagination, is a very special musician. Unparalleled and always moving forward, he continues to take listeners somewhere captivating. While along the way creating gorgeously musical classics like <em>Paris 1919 </em>and <em>Vintage Violence</em>. Founding, with Lou Reed, The Velvet Underground, he would create a sonic watershed that took the world – and rock music – years to catch up. By that time of course, he was onto something else.</p>
<p>The <em>Corner of My Sky</em> video features a cosmic toaster that ejects bread to another dimension (with Port Talbot actor Michael Sheen getting the red mist over it). But its perfect juncture is when Owens, on a beach wearing scarlet (Cristóbal) Balenciaga couture from the 1950s, sings along with Cale. Wistful and spontaneous, it’s a fleeting moment beyond the wax.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>John Cale: </strong>Hi Kelly – congrats on your new album! Hope you’re keeping well and safe these days. I recall you said you were in a rather ‘down’ period emotionally where you began to doubt yourself creatively. What would you say was most influential in pulling you out of your fog?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Lee Owens:</strong> <em>Diolch yn fawr</em>! I think the most influential thing was reading <em>Women Who Run With The Wolves</em> by Clarissa Pinkola Estés. This book was a beautiful companion for me, that spoke gently yet directly via storytelling and poetic understandings of self – the most important perspective being that in life and all relationships, yes, there is death, but how about re-birth too? What happens after the period of darkness? Clarissa informed me of how to re-wild my spirit, therefore my life, therefore my creativity and therefore my heart.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> This is your second album: how did the process compare to the first? Did you feel pressure to compete with yourself?</p>
<p><strong>KLO:</strong> It’s interesting you mentioned competition with self, as yes that’s perhaps the only interest I had this time round. I was determined not to bow down to the pressure of the ‘difficult second album’ mental torture! Having seen a lot of friends go through this I knew the best thing I could do for myself and the fans of my music was to be true to myself, to make the music in an honest and real way, honouring what needed to be said and made instead of bowing down to what I <em>think</em> others might want me to make. Whilst of course stepping up the production and the quality of songwriting (I hope). But as always, I can only be where I am: each album is a surprise to me, revealing itself slowly and that’s what I love about making music, it keeps on blooming.</p>
<p><strong>JC: </strong>Being a Welsh musician, there are a host of historical predispositions. Have you ever thought of working your pieces through a choral setting?</p>
<p><strong>KLO:</strong> I absolutely have! In fact, in December last year I did a show in London with the London Contemporary Voice Choir. The whole show was acoustic (apart from my vocal delays and feedback from midi keyboard). We arranged my tracks into parts for the choir to sing, including all the synth melodies, string arrangements and most of the percussion, it was amazing. I’ve always wanted to work with a Welsh male voice choir; have them hum bass lines and other parts of tracks and build and record something from there, with my voice on top, maybe even [making] an entire album like that. Perhaps you could help me? [Laughs].</p>
<p>What do you still want to explore creatively, that you don’t feel you’ve been able to before?</p>
<p><strong>JC: </strong>The Welsh language. My understanding of its humour is much easier for me to understand now than when I grew up. Strangely, I can approach the language in a barrel roll fashion by blindly opening a dictionary and firing away as the words trip out.</p>
<p>I think new technologies always provide surprises that upset the creative applecart and although you may not always know your destination, if you realise that the journey is often more important than the destination … Being lost is a form of rewarding discrimination.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>KLO: </strong>What does Cymru mean to you and would you ever consider moving back? Are there any particular Welsh myths that you love or connect to?</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> The further away Wales appears in my memory, the more complicated its images and demands become on my understanding of my past. Present circumstances make travel impossible so any kind of movement through the Welsh countryside must wait for a while, but if I ever tracked down the location of the story of [Welsh outlaw] Twm Siôn Cati, I would happily wander through its imaginative curiosity.</p>
<p>Is there one single place in the world you feel most inspired?</p>
<p><strong>KLO: </strong>One? Ah, that’s hard … I guess predictably in Snowdonia. There’s nothing like feeling small and humbled by mountains/nature yet simultaneously feeling completely connected to everything. I like the rawness of nature in Wales, I find beauty and inspiration in its ruggedness and harshness in places. And as you so rightly pointed out in <em>Corner Of My Sky</em>, I love the rain: ‘thank God, the rain!’</p>
<p>What has been your most satisfying collaboration so far? How was it working with Nick Drake? His albums are some of my favourite pieces of music.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> Nick was a satisfying combination, I think mainly because at the time I was into my paranoia rock phase and Nick, being such a gentle soul, his elegiac style forced me to reconnoitre another side to my arranging. It pushed me back into a more melodic quieter style of playing, something I’d abandoned by that time.</p>
<p>To me, collaborating was a way of influence: oft-times coming from an opposing force was a satisfying way of growing your developing creativity. Some are less fraught than others but most have been satisfying in their own way. Our recent collab had an unexpected ease about it, as familiar as it was new.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> What do you see as the limitations of electronic music?</p>
<p><strong>KLO:</strong> Good question. In one way, maybe naively, I see electronic music as limitless. Working with electronic music is always a collaboration in my eyes, and as long as a human is operating at the other end it is still organic in a way. Perhaps that won’t always be the case (and isn’t now even) but that’s what excites me. It is something that’s given me the freedom to express myself, having not learned how to read or write music. What I am interested in is combining electronic sounds with sounds of nature and more traditional instruments such as strings … and then there’s the <em>voice</em>, which is ancient potency, filled with human essence and magic. Perhaps there is a limit in terms of not being fully satisfied with electronic sounds alone?</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="RKGbveD_cuE"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKGbveD_cuE" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><strong>JC:</strong> In this new normal, one of the things I miss most is performing live. There’s nothing to fill that void of the connection with the audience on the night. Have you considered a way to connect with your audience by other means?</p>
<p><strong>KLO: </strong>I miss it too, there’s nothing like it. I think that’s one thing we’ve realised during this time: we need each other. We need to share spaces and come together, connection is everything. In terms of finding new ways of connecting, I’ve DJ’d inside the game Minecraft which was a trip! I also had three album listening parties with fans on Zoom, everyone dancing in their bedrooms or living rooms; it felt like a beautiful way to connect to people and experience the album together. I’m also looking at a streamed live performance, but would want to make sure it sounds perfect and looks beautiful.</p>
<p>Is there anything you regret in life or feel you should have done differently?</p>
<p><strong>JC: </strong>Of course. Many, many things I’d have done differently. Many, many solutions … many, many inconveniences that I avoided, knowing it would be an infuriating source of resolution in the future. My regrets are nevertheless still few.</p>
<p><strong>KLO: </strong>What’s one of your all-time favourite LPs?</p>
<p><strong>JC: </strong>It changes daily; so many favourites throughout a lifetime. I guess it would be the very first LP given to me by my uncle while he was working at the Cardiff BBC studios: Michael Rabin performing the solo Violin Caprices by Paganini. A maddeningly inspiring work that made an annoying presence in my late teens – and drove my mam spare. That record pushed me into adapting a violin piece to transcribe for a viola … *see notes about regrets*. [Laughs].</p>
<p><strong>KLO: </strong>What’s your greatest fear?</p>
<p><strong>JC: </strong>The upcoming US election. Full-stop.</p>

<p>The world is a complicated place right now. Between the relentless friction of political discourse and the harrowing reality of living through a global pandemic, it can be difficult to find lightness among the dark, but British artist <strong>Ben Burgis</strong> – whose show <em>Odd One Out</em> opens at Jermaine Gallacher’s Lant Street showroom today – offers a moment of escapism through surreal depictions of his fantasised self.</p>
<p>“There are decisions to make about content, combined with technical skill, and then it’s just practice,” explains Burgis, when asked about the motivation behind his paintings. “The more you do it the better it will get, much like golf, but golf’s not an emotional response to the world, or very funny, and these are two of the most important intentions for me – sensitivity and humour, revealing the stupidity of your inner world.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Burgis’ paintings are like pantomime self-portraits. Speaking to me from a friend’s London home on the eve of his show’s opening – himself having moved to North Wales after an unfulfilling stint in the capital – the artist’s longing for escape is as evident in his explanation of his work as it is the absurd scenarios depicted in each painting. “There’s a big embrace of the countryside and a sense of feeling myself suddenly in these roles, listening to lots of country music and laughing at myself doing that, and thinking about myself wearing Stetsons and how that would kind of be impossible and an appropriation of different subjects.”</p>
<p>While many artists are notorious for taking themselves seriously to the point of parody, Burgis’ description of his own work is peppered with acknowledgements of his own pretence and an endearing honesty about what it means to be genuinely expressive in an era of endless irony. Alluding to his time spent studying at London’s renowned arts university Goldsmiths, he explains, “I really do like this kind of emotional response, that something really would just be from the heart, but that just feels so ridiculous if you’ve been conceptually and critically informed, so then there is this laughing at yourself for any kind of sincerity or wearing your emotions on your chest.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>For artists, the problem with trying to make a living is being regularly faced with the choice between making the art they want to make and making the art that galleries want to sell. Having previously rejected formal representation and the stability that comes with it, Burgis speaks warmly of finding tenderness in the chaos of friend and collaborator Gallacher. “There’s no one like him,” insists the artist. “He’s got nothing, no security in his life. He’s self-made and he’s just great.”</p>
<p>The pair have been close for years, with Burgis briefly touching on them having “a thing” in the earlier years of their friendship. Safe in the hands of a gallerist who values the freedom of intimate working relationships, Burgis has found a dynamic that allows him to embrace the personal narratives that shape his work. “I’ve definitely worked under much more clearly defined collaborations, but because we’re such close friends and it’s so natural, we don’t really need to do it,” he says, talking about the creative production of <em>Odd One Out</em>. “It’s very loose. There’s a lot of trust – he’s one of my closest friends.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>With exhibitions, residencies and art fairs cancelled around the globe, it’s been a difficult year for artists to exhibit their work at all. Masked visitors to Gallacher’s Lant Street showroom will be part of a lucky few who get to experience Burgis’ work in person in 2020, and he hopes they will allow their own imagination to guide their understanding of it. “I wouldn’t like to intend people to think something specific,” he explains. “I think the best arts power is in the ambiguity of its interpretation. Ambiguity is a wonderful thing, possible meanings floating about, suggesting nothing concrete but wafting warm notes of affinity. I often think about how I came across art as a child and the inclusion and shared consciousness I felt from it, seeing the world through someone else’s eyes and feeling less alone. If that’s something I can do in my work I’d be happy.”</p>
<p><em>Ben Burgis: Odd One Out is at Jermaine Gallacher’s showroom at 59 Lant Street, London, SE1 1QN, from October 8 – 18, 2020, from 11am – 6pm, by appointment.</em></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[






<p>Bong Joon-ho’s Oscar sweep for <a href="/design-living/12226/parasite-screenwriter-han-jin-won-this-could-be-our-story-bong-joon-ho"><em>Parasite</em></a> was heralded as a watershed moment for South Korean cinema back in January 2020. But barely 18 months earlier, a film of a similar premise marked a contemporary highpoint for Japanese cinema in the West after taking home top honours at Cannes 2019.</p>
<p><em>Shoplifters </em>was the first Japanese film to win the Palme d’Or in over 20 years; an unexpected triumph that Jury president Cate Blanchett said “completely bowled over” the voting panel. A masterfully poignant drama about a poverty-stricken family on the streets of Tokyo, <em>Shoplifters</em> feels somewhat overshadowed by director Bong’s outrageous successes in 2020. But director <strong>Hirokazu Kore-eda</strong> has, in fact, been turning in masterpieces for even longer than his Korean counterpart.</p>
<p>After honing his craft as a documentarian and a television director, Kore-eda released his fiction feature debut <em>Maborosi</em> in 1995, and quickly became identified by Western critics as a key proponent of Japan’s ‘New Wave of the 90s’. His thoughtful and meditative works initially drew comparisons to the tender family dramas of Yasujirō Ozu – a leading filmmaker during Japan’s Golden Age of Cinema in the 50s. But in the years since, he’s expanded his filmmaking style considerably.</p>
<p>A gentle sense of pacing, a focus on the intricacies of familial relationships, and a consideration for the small joys in life remain the heart and soul of Kore-eda’s understated cinema. And as his latest TV drama <em>A Day Off Of Kasumi Arimura </em>premieres at the <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/london-film-festival">BFI London Film Festival</a> this Saturday, we reflect on the serene masterworks of a director who remains at the forefront of Japanese filmmaking in 2020.</p><h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN9sr5wVkik"><em>After Life</em>,</a> 1998 (lead image)</h2>
<p>The film that brought Kore-eda widespread international recognition is built on a unique premise. What if, upon death, you’re sent to a purgatorial social services centre to decide upon a single happy memory to take into the afterlife?</p>
<p>Inspired by <em>Without Memory, </em>Kore-eda’s 1994 documentary about a man with a neurological disorder that disrupts his ability to form memories, <em>After Life</em> manages to be both lightly comical and dramatically poignant as it examines what may be the only true “eternal life” after death.</p>
<p>The film is particularly memorable for its montage sequences, which combine real-life interviews with dramatised performances, as a colourful cast of troubled teens and elderly grumps answer the film’s central question. Answers include a memorable meal, a trip to Disneyland, and memories of young love. Either way, savouring the good times is a sentiment that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0mDpUpIZ6Y"><em>Maborosi</em></a>, 1995</h2>
<p>The tender romance between a married couple is cruelly torn to pieces when husband Ikuo (played by future superstar Tadanobu Asano) suddenly, inexplicably takes his own life on his way home from work. Doting wife Yumiko, now a widowed single mother, grieves her loss, before eventually remarrying and relocating to a quiet coastal village. But her quest for happiness is hampered by the weight of tragedy that she bears on her shoulders, in this meditative drama about unresolved emotional trauma.</p>
<p>Kore-eda’s fiction feature debut borrows heavily from the book of Ozu. He almost entirely eschews any form of camera movement across this film’s 109-minute runtime, instead choosing to focus on a rich <em>mise-en-scene </em>to fill every shot. Shot in rich, green hues, <em>Maborosi </em>almost feels like a visual painting at points, as lingering stills of deserted train platforms, sleepy harbour shores and lush green countryside mark Yumiko’s journey. It won the Best Cinematography award at Venice as a result, highlighting the crux of Kore-eda’s spellbinding craft from the offset.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402557.jpg" alt="Nobody Knows" />        <figcaption>
Nobody Knows, 2004. (Film still)        </figcaption>

    </figure>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8COIEaleR8"><em>Nobody Knows</em></a>, 2004</h2>
<p>Inspired by the 1988 Sugamo child abandonment case in Osaka, <em>Nobody Knows</em> follows the lives of four children struggling to survive in a tiny city apartment after being abandoned by their mother. As 12-year-old Akira fends for his young family using the small amount of cash left to them, their dwelling grows increasingly unsanitary as they survive on expired convenience store sushi and cup noodles.</p>
<p>While stylistically a more dynamic piece of filmmaking than his Ozu-indebted early works, <em>Nobody Knows</em> offers an unforgiving view of the hopes of a vulnerable family unit. It’s the focus on children that makes it all the more heartbreaking, and a powerful lead performance by Yuya Yagira would make history when he became the youngest actor to win the Best Actor award at Cannes in 2004.</p>
<p>Shot over a full year, the film, at times, feels more like an observational documentary than a drama, making the enchanting highs blissful, and the tragic lows devastatingly bleak. 15 years on, it remains Kore-eda’s most emotionally captivating work.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402556.jpg" alt="still walking" />        <figcaption>
Still Walking, 2008. (Film still)        </figcaption>

    </figure>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gPbHqmjhNU"><em>Still Walking</em></a>, 2008</h2>
<p><em>Still Walking</em>’s focus on the gentle tensions of a rural family reunion is effective precisely because of its subtlety. And while there is precious little plot to be found over the film’s 24-hour timeframe, there is plenty of drama in the simple acts, such as the preparation of corn fritters in the kitchen.</p>
<p>The dining table is a central setting in <em>Still Walking, </em>as the audience is encouraged to contemplate lessons about life, the past and the future through three generations of the Yokoyama family. The patriarchal figure, Kyohei, a miserly retired doctor impenetrable by his kin, represents the changing of values with time, and he rues the loss of his place in society. But through the family’s youngest member, Atsushi, who is exposed to all manner of potential role models throughout the day, a multitude of futures and opportunities can be humbly observed.</p>
<p>By the time the film reaches its understated conclusion, there is little catharsis to be found. But a central metaphor about old butterflies changing colours with the seasons, at least, provides some hope for the family in the future.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402555.jpg" alt="shoplifters" />        <figcaption>
Shoplifters, 2018. (Film still)        </figcaption>

    </figure>
<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9382rwoMiRc"><em>Shoplifters</em></a>, 2018</h2>
<p>Cannes Jury president Cate Blanchett described <em>Shoplifters </em>as “one of the quietest, loveliest and most emotionally enduring films in the competition” in 2018. But with its vibrant cinematography, vivid, urban setting and captivating performances, <em>Shoplifters </em>may actually be the magnum opus of Kore-eda’s canon; a masterful display of craft, and a text that goes all the way back to his roots.</p>
<p>A bittersweet exploration of the bonds that tie a homeless “family” together in the underbelly of an unnamed metropolis, <em>Shoplifters</em>, at times, almost feels like a fairy tale. The blossoming relationship between Dickensian crook Osamu and the neglected toddler Yuri (whom he essentially adopts) is one of the film's central charms to the end. But <em>Shoplifters </em>takes place in the real world – something made evident by its documentary-style camerawork. And when the social services catch wind of this ramshackle band of waifs and strays, things don’t turn out the way the viewer might hope.</p>
<p>Earning 4.6 billion yen at the domestic box office, $77 million worldwide, and picking up a nomination for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars in 2019, <em>Shoplifters</em> is at the very apex of Japanese filmmaking today. In a watershed year for East Asian cinema in the West, there is no better place to start than here.</p>]]>

<p>Yesterday, <strong>Maison Margiela</strong> revealed its Spring/Summer 2021 collection by John Galliano in a film by Nick Knight, entitled <em>S.W.A.L.K. II</em>. The film, in a true reflection of the times, begins with footage taken from Zoom conversations between Galliano and his collaborators, including Knight, as they formulate the plan for the project.</p>
<p>We see Galliano discuss the conception of the collection, which takes inspiration from the tango, and the process of creating it. Later in the film, which can be viewed below, we see Galliano’s muses – among them, Leon Dame of runway walk fame, and Malick Bodian – perform this and other dances on a floor that is flooded with water.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>As part of its Genius “one house, different voices” project, Moncler invites designers to reinterpret its ‘codes’ – from Richard Quinn and Hiroshi Fujiwara, to 1017 ALYX 9SM, Craig Green and Simone Rocha. JW Anderson is the latest designer to join this roster and his collection is now available – a blend of Moncler’s iconic “inflated” duvet fabric and Anderson’s archive and androgynous approach to fashion, captured in imagery by the photographer <a href="/search?q=Tyler+Mitchell">Tyler Mitchell</a>.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3><a href="https://www.matchesfashion.com/womens/designers/alexander-mcqueen">Alexander McQueen at Matches Fashion</a></h3>
<p>Matches Fashion meanwhile has launched an exclusive Alexander McQueen capsule featuring best-selling pieces from previous collections from the British house – namely, tailoring. Featuring pinstriped, Glen check and even crystal-embellished suiting, all in a razor-sharp cut, in addition to shoes and accessories, the pieces bear all the trademarks of Sarah Burton’s design language: a darkness, a femininity, a romance and, of course, a subversion. It’s tailoring like none other.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3><a href="https://www.fredperry.com/men/raf-simons">Fred Perry x Raf Simons</a></h3>
<p>Fred Perry has released its latest collaboration with Raf Simons, which represents an amalgamation of pieces from the brand’s archive and the Belgian designer’s aesthetic – to great effect. Spanning parkas, polos, patch jumpers and shirts, the subculture-infused collection features imagery taken from Fred Perry and Ditto’s book <em>100 Club</em> which, released in 2018, represents a celebration of the legendary London venue.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h3><a href="https://pyermoss.com/pages/rock-the-vote">Pyer Moss</a></h3>
<p>Ahead of the United States Presidential Election, New York-based brand Pyer Moss has launched the Sean John by Pyer Moss “Vote or Die ... For Real” T-shirt in a bid to encourage people to register to vote – and to raise awareness of Rock the Vote, a nonpartisan, nonprofit dedicated to building the political power of young people. Debuted at the label’s S/S21 show in September, the garment is a revisitation of Sean ‘P. Diddy’ Combs’ original “Vote or Die” T-shirt which launched in 2004 – to the same end.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Another great new collaboration is Supreme’s with Yohji Yamamoto. Yes, the streetwear brand has teamed up with Japan’s noir maestro on an all-black (naturally) collection that features artwork by Sancheeto and longtime Yamamoto collaborator Peter Saville, encompassing coats, jackets, a suit, a shirt, a sweatshirt, five T-shirts and a beanie. Just out and already priceless fashion historical artefacts.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Maria Grazia Chiuri’s Autumn/Winter 2020 collection – presented via a film in July – included a number of new takes on old Dior classics, from polka dots and checks to the reinvented Bar silhouette. It also featured a couple of new accessories, such as the Lady D-Lite bag and the new Dior Bobby, both of which are now available to buy.</p>]]>

<p>The house of <strong>Chanel</strong> is inextricably tied up with Hollywood – and not just its modern incarnation. It spans back to the birth of the place as the home of the American film industry in the interwar period: in March 1931, <a href="/tag/coco-chanel">Gabrielle Chanel</a> travelled to Hollywood to design costumes at the request of Samuel Goldwyn of United Artists. Chanel was the first French fashion house to do so, an attempt by Hollywood to capture the glamour of the couture industry and Chanel’s allure, already world-famous to millions who could never buy a dress thanks to the phenomenal success of Chanel No.5 – incidentally, introduced a century ago, in 1921. It was also an attempt to learn from history: the fast-changing fashions of 1929-30, when hemlines dropped as the stock market crashed, waists rose, and a romantic breed of femininity outmoded the sharp, angular silhouette of the flapper, managed to make carefully conceived film costumes entirely irrelevant virtually overnight. Goldwyn figured he could get ahead of fashion’s curve by inviting the greatest living couturière to give him a preview of where her febrile mind may be headed.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Chanel was handsomely compensated: $1 million (the equivalent of around $16 million today), and the enviable and much-publicised task of designing both on- and off-screen wardrobes for United’s roster of stars including Ina Claire and Gloria Swanson. It’s a remarkably modern conceit – as were so many of Chanel’s firsts. The house designed costumes for three Hollywood pictures: <em>Palmy Days</em> (1931); <em>Tonight or Never</em> (1931); and <em>The Greeks Had a Word for Them</em> (1932), before Chanel and Goldwyn fell out. Reportedly, the subtlety and ease of Chanel’s designs – precisely the qualities that drew women then, and now, to the clothes bearing her name – were not showy or flashy enough for cinema to Goldwyn’s mind. Examining the styles of the great costume designers of the period, Travis Banton, or Gilbert Adrian, their clothes are decorative, theatrical and somewhat extreme. Ironically, Adrian’s taste for exaggeratedly broad and puffed shoulders, proposed to flatter the figure of Joan Crawford, would have a seismic influence on styles of the decade, often outpacing the impact of couture. That said, Chanel’s clothes would never reflect those qualities – she left haute couture histrionics to her contemporary Elsa Schiaparelli, returning to Paris to continue creating clothes geared to the dynamic pace and need of the life of the modern women – the very lifestyle Chanel herself lived best.</p>
<p>“The world of Chanel evokes so many images, a whole unconscious that’s linked to cinema,” said Viard. And indeed, Chanel didn’t stop collaborating with film auteurs and stars, including work with stars of French cinema such as Jean Renoir. In the 1960s, her work with both French Nouvelle Vague directors and European cinema stars was significant: often, her clothes were used to epitomise elegance, refinement, occasionally haute bourgeois mores – such as Romy Schneider’s character in Luchino Visconti’s 1962 film <em>Boccaccio ’70</em>. Visconti not only asked Chanel to dress Schneider, but to coach the actress on the idea of elegance.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Schneider was one of Viard’s reference points – alongside Anna Karina and <a href="/design-living/10051/an-interview-with-jeanne-moreau">Jeanne Moreau</a>, all of whom appeared in a pre-show teaser by <a href="/user/InezandVinoodh">Inez van Lamsweerde  Vinoodh Matadin</a>, juxtaposing the past with the present and telescoping time as only cinema can. Cinema, and Chanel – the timeless Chanel tweed suit, easy chiffon gowns, little black dresses and relaxed, slouchy silhouettes where a masculine air, paradoxically, only serves to emphasise femininity, are all references from Chanel’s heritage that still feel contemporary. In a sense, they are as iconic and recognisable as the Hollywood sign itself – which even when it reads ‘CHANEL’ could never be mistaken. “This collection is a tribute to the muses of the house,” Viard said afterwards. “Some of them are far away, it’s been a long time since we saw them.” She was talking about the global roster of actors affiliated with Chanel: but she could have been talking about those house codes, and indeed about Gabrielle Chanel herself.</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[






<p>2020 has been a year of unimaginable challenge – not least for fashion’s emerging designers, who have been left particularly vulnerable by the social and economic turmoil that has erupted since the beginning of the pandemic. In April, the British Fashion Council released a frightening report which suggested that up to 35 per cent of young designers in the UK might not make it past the next three months, and that over half of the industry might be wiped out by the end of the year without urgent and drastic intervention.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this intervention has come – through the BFC, for example, <a href="/fashion-beauty/12509/recipients-of-first-bfc-foundation-fund-alighieri-charles-jeffrey-craig-green">which launched the BFC Foundation Fashion Fund in May</a>, allocating grants to a number of British designer businesses. Matches Fashion has also stepped in with <strong>The Innovators Programme</strong> – a project that aims to support 12 designers spanning mens- and womenswear over the coming year with mentorship, preferential business terms and marketing. These designers represent a diverse group and include some of fashion’s brightest talents: Art School, <a href="/tag/ahluwalia">Ahluwalia</a>, <a href="/tag/chopova-lowena">Chopova Lowena</a>, Stefan Cooke, Germanier, Halpern, Harris Reed, <a href="/tag/charles-jeffrey-loverboy">Charles Jeffrey LOVERBOY</a>, Thebe Magugu, <a href="/tag/ludovic-de-saint-sernin">Ludovic de Saint Sernin</a>, <a href="/tag/bianca-saunders">Bianca Saunders</a> and <a href="/tag/grace-wales-bonner">Wales Bonner</a>.</p>
<p>Here, speaking in their own words, five of these designers discuss this past year, how it’s changed the way they create and what – in these dark and uncertain times – is making them feel hopeful.</p><h2>Bianca Saunders</h2>
<p><em>“This year has been as challenging as it has been exciting. The profile of my brand has grown exponentially since my presentation back in January and I’m so thankful for that, I’m getting such amazing recognition from magazines and brands that I was a fan of growing up. But then Covid-19 came along and changed the rules for everybody. Us independent designers had to completely rethink the way we work, and it was sink or swim, but I feel like I’ve come through it stronger than ever.</em></p>
<p><em>“[The challenge has been] taking a step back, slowing down, being mindful. [It’s] the first time I’ve had a chance to do that since before I started at the RCA. But in the end, it was a positive thing, it helped me get back into a more creative space and really dig into what I want my brand to be, now and in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>“I am one of 12 designers that Matches Fashion are supporting for the year. They will be supported by giving each of us industry professional mentors to give advice on optimising the business plus special terms for sales and marketing strategies such as editorials. </em></p>
<p><em>“I think this pandemic has made us all think about what matters most, and hopefully it will change people’s perspective for the better, when it comes to fashion and buying clothes. Hopefully now more people have had the chance to become more considerate of their impact, and they will stop buying disposable products that you throw after one season and will now invest in quality pieces that mean something to them.”</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402500.jpeg" alt="MATCHESFASHION X INNOVATORS THEBE MAGUGU YASMIN FU" />        <figcaption>

<h2>Thebe Magugu</h2>
<p><em>“This year has been chock full of extremes – on the one end, I have had continued enjoyment of the brand I am building, being exposed to immense growth and expanding my community. On the other hand, I have seen the devastation that the very community that nourishes me has suffered at the hands of Covid-19 – South Africa is the fifth most affected country globally, and already we had been experiencing a 30 per cent unemployment rate before all this. So it’s been a year completely in emotional and physical flux.</em></p>
<p><em>“We have been thrown into a world where our industry has been turned on its head – people’s priorities have shifted, and while bigger brands may have a buffer, young designers have been devastated and some totally eviscerated by the time we are in. At the start of the pandemic, some planned buys were either postponed or cancelled – and delivered orders had postponed payments. These are just two of the many challenges designers need to face today.</em></p>
<p><em>“Responding to this crisis, Matches Fashion has created a programme – The Innovators Programme – to help mitigate the effects on emerging brands. It is a year-long commitment to the 12 selected designers with not only seasonal buys, but mentorship opportunities and amplification across marketing and various channels. This helps tremendously in curtailing the severe effects of Covid-19 on business.</em></p>
<p><em>“I think because fashion as an industry is solutions-based, it will always find a way to troubleshoot itself when something no longer becomes viable – and I think this is especially true for the youth in the industry, who are asking questions and interrogating what’s relevant, what’s sustainable and what’s right.”</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2>Chopova Lowena</h2>
<p><em>“The past year for us has been full of amazing opportunities, growing pains, and lots of learning and developing. Throughout the past year (our second year of having a brand) we have really focused on how to better design for our customer and understanding the balance between design and holding true to our vision while also thinking about the practicality. We have been focused on scaling and managing our deadstock and upcycled vintage fabric practice and retaining our ethos across expanding into new categories. We have also learned how to grow our business in a sustainable way, scaling our deadstock and vintage fabric range and being really, really busy!</em></p>
<p><em>“The Innovators is a wonderful platform to be a part of with so many talented designers. Matches Fashion has been a support system to young designers beyond what you would imagine from a retail partner. Matches Fashion has always dealt with things in a personal and caring way and that’s what has always set the team apart, it feels like family. This programme provides us with mentorship, help of all kinds, and a commitment to buy for one year which during these challenging times is an incredibly important security for us.</em></p>
<p><em>“But also due to lockdown we have had to slow down and that has been a really positive change! We are focusing more on educating our customers on how special and skilled the practices which all come together to make clothing are and that is something we want to put our energy behind. More emotional connections to clothing is the right kind of incentive to gear people more towards investing in pieces rather than turning to fast fashion.</em></p>
<p><em>“[What makes me feel hopeful is] that there has been a strong sense of community between all parts of the industry, retailers, designers, magazines – are all helping each other!”</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<h2>Ahluwalia</h2>
<p><em>“The past year has been a roller coaster. There have been so many amazing highlights such as being selected as an LVMH Prize finalist and being named as a Matches Fashion Innovator. But there has also been a global pandemic and heightened coverage and discussions around racism, so it has been a lot to contend with both professionally and personally. Covid and the subsequent lockdown was a huge challenge, as a business we lost some retail accounts, had production stuck in customs for months and there was just so much uncertainty.</em></p>
<p><em>“At the beginning of the lockdown I felt quite hopeless but I am generally a resourceful person so I was able to use the time to try and get through the situation and also spend time considering new things I want to achieve with my business.</em></p>
<p><em>“I was told by Paul and Damian from Matches Fashion that I was a part of the project and it was so, so nice to hear. Matches Fashion has always been a great retail partner that has offered me opportunities. Last year, they took me to New York for a press day which enabled me to meet such a huge network of people and make some great connections that benefit the business to this day. This new project has already really increased visibility for the brand and I’m looking forward to the mentoring.</em></p>
<p><em>“This year I have learnt that I am resilient. [What makes me feel hopeful is] my amazing team who work with me every day and all the brilliantly talented people coming up the ranks who aren’t afraid to show the world their ideas and teach it a thing or two.”</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402499.jpeg" alt="MATCHESFASHION X INNOVATORS LUDOVIC SAINT SERNIN I" />        <figcaption>

<h2>Ludovic de Saint Sernin</h2>
<p><em>“I think we all went through an incredibly challenging period. I am a very optimistic person though and the most important thing for me is to always try to take out something positive from each and every experience. There’s been many challenges for me this year, and the most important thing was to just keep going and believing in yourself to be able to overcome these challenges.</em></p>
<p><em>“The Innovators Programme is such a great initiative and I think every single designer in the programme will tell you that it means everything to have the support of Matches Fashion. It gives us security, stability and strength to keep creating and be the best version of ourselves.</em></p>
<p><em>“I have learnt to be more selective with the people that I work with and focus essentially on the people who love the brand and understand the meaning of what we are doing. And Matches Fashion completely understands us and what we’re about and they are here to help us and provide us with the best guidance.</em></p>
<p><em>“I think there’s been so much growth this year, and fashion can reflect change and evolution. Like everything else for things to change it takes time and it’s about time there’s change and I am hopeful that the fashion industry is accepting to take actions to make a change for a better future.”</em></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[






<p>Back in 1981, a 15-year-old <strong>Andre Walker</strong> sat in his bedroom in Brooklyn, New York. With cut-outs from his mother’s magazines plastered all over the walls – “like a <a href="/tag/yayoi-kusama">Yayoi Kusama</a> installation”, he says – he dreamt of working as a fashion designer, despite having little more experience than taking a pair of scissors to a T-shirt and selling it at his mother’s hair salon.</p>
<p>That same year, he launched his debut collection at a neighbourhood nightclub, Oasis, capturing attention with intricately cut coats that had been designed freehand, without traditional patterns. It was his first step towards fulfilling his ambition of following the path forged by Black New York-based designers Stephen Burrows and <a href="https://www.anothermanmag.com/style-grooming/11150/willi-smith-streetwear-cooper-hewitt-exhibition-rizzoli">Willi Smith</a>, whose WilliWear label Walker later worked for.</p>
<p>Walker is today regarded as one of fashion’s cult figures, widely adored but rarely celebrated in the mainstream. He is best known now for his recent work with the likes of <a href="/tag/marc-jacobs">Marc Jacobs</a>, <a href="/tag/kim-jones">Kim Jones</a> and <a href="/tag/comme-des-garcons">Comme des Garçons</a>’ <a href="/tag/rei-kawakubo">Rei Kawakubo</a>. However, it’s his signature flat cut and avant-garde silhouettes, collected and treasured by fashion fanatics such as Patricia Field, that are truly impressive – more so, when you consider he is entirely self-taught.</p>
<p>More than 30 years on since that first show of Walker’s, <a href="/tag/grace-wales-bonner"><strong>Grace Wales Bonner</strong></a> made her own design debut in London, drawing on her British-Jamaican background and restarting a conversation initiated by the Black designers that came before her. So few that you could count them on a single hand, they include Burrows and Smith, Patrick Kelly, and of course, Walker himself.</p>
<p>Inspired in large part by her own heritage, Wales Bonner has gained renown for her considered repertoire that reimagines Black masculinity from a softer, more sensual viewpoint, connecting the past and present and offering impeccable tailoring with craft details that make the pieces feel like treasures – Sunday best.</p>
<p>But Wales Bonner’s focus extends much further than her own roots, meandering through Cuba, India, and Senegal, too – in thoughtful appreciation rather than appropriation though. Her collaborators are equally global, comprising the Nigerian writer Ben Okri, Ghanaian-Russian photographer <a href="/fashion-beauty/11874/liz-johnson-artur-the-cult-london-photographer-tapped-by-rihanna-fenty">Liz Johnson Artur</a>, African-American artist Jacob Lawrence and many more.</p>
<p>Connecting across the Atlantic, the pair muse here on their respective careers and fashion’s complex relationship with race.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>Zoom conversation between Andre Walker and Grace Wales Bonner, August 2020.</em></p>
<p><strong>Grace Wales Bonner:</strong> I wanted to start by asking you about your show in Paris a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Andre Walker:</strong> That was <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2018-ready-to-wear/and-re-walker">Non Existent Patterns [Spring/Summer 2018]</a>. What was cool about that show was that it came a year after my father died, when I was losing my mind and having an existential crisis. But then lots of people started sending me clothes that I’d designed when I was a kid – maybe 16 or 17 – and I thought it was amazing that those clothes had initially been made without patterns. Lots of the clothes were cut freehand, that’s how desperate I was to participate in fashion. I remember thinking, “I have to be a designer.” So, showing the collection in Paris, my teenage work, as an adult approaching a midlife crisis, was amazing. It was a gift from God. I really believe that was my father’s send-off. He was saying, “Please take care of him.”</p>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> It was so incredible and spectacular. It was just unbelievable how beautiful and timeless it was. In a way, it’s kind of shocking to see something like that because that’s not what we’re used to seeing in fashion at all. Do you think it’s possible to create in that way within the framework that currently exists in the industry?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> Oh, totally. Even more so now than ever. I believe these times will bring about the most important strongholds that will keep fashion going, because it’s a utility like soap. Intensity is just as necessary as simplicity and lucidity. The truth is that we only have this world to work on, so even with climate change, social injustices and a pandemic, it doesn’t change the fact that the economic model is still in place and we will always have to work. Trying to inject some kind of joy into what we’re doing is key, although passion can be very draining. I’ve been drained out, but I’ve also been lucky, I guess. Sometimes my passion overtakes my ability for reason and logic, but it’s up to you how sensitive you are about your business. If ten people say it’s wonderful but one person says it’s crap, you have to be able to look at what you’re doing, how you’re communicating your message, and take it from there.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><strong>GWB:</strong> I was so excited to first discover you and I’ve always really admired you. I’m so inspired by your work and it’s been incredibly influential on me and my friends – people like Tom Guinness, Mavi [Staiano] and Eric N Mack.</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> I love you guys so much, you’re my lifeline.</p>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> I feel like you have really managed to protect your freedom over time and it’s inspiring to see how you create and how [your work is] completely in its own space. That’s so important, having space to work and operate in that way. How do you keep it sacred?</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> The protection you talk about isn’t really protection, it’s more of a habit, but it can be protection, too. It’s a lot of intuition, observation and analysis, sometimes with a bit too much overthinking, too. If you can balance overthinking with a bit of spontaneity and a lot of impetuousness, then you’ll get what you love about me. I’m also a highly competitive person and an impossible elitist. I’m sure whenever my name is brought up in conversation, people say, “He’s impossible” – and I am impossible. I thought I had to look at 400 collections a year just to know what I didn’t want to do, but now it’s up to 10,000 collections a year. There’s so much stuff out there you could drive yourself insane just by looking around. It’s so stressful out there right now, especially for me – I grew up not having a phone or emails in my pocket, and that is real freedom. Freedom for me is also teaming up with people I can actually work with and [with whom it can] be mutually beneficial. Every designer has something different to share, whether it’s culture, process or provenance.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>GWB:</strong> For me, I’m interested in a kind of sensitivity, sensuality or softness and allowing myself to express myself through that. It’s often in connection with the way I think about luxury as well. I look for a European luxury and these heritage brands, and then create something that comes from a different cultural perspective that celebrates or values the same ideas of beauty and craft. It’s about hybridity, a meeting point between the two things.</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> You’ve done a great job of bringing the cultures you’re interested in into the story, it always feels like a discovery. You have a National Geographic approach to things – it’s about discovery, viewing what is out there and what exists without judgment, rather than feeling like you’re being hit over the head with some kind of blatant ideology. That’s how I think of what Yves Saint Laurent did. I didn’t really appreciate what he did until maybe ten years ago – I used to think it was pure appropriation. What he actually did is get these great caricatures and it’s wonderful. He introduced people to different cultures through his work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you can balance overthinking with a bit of spontaneity and a lot of impetuousness, then you’ll get what you love about me. I’m also a highly competitive person and an impossible elitist. I’m sure whenever my name is brought up in conversation, people say, ‘He’s impossible’ – and I am impossible” – Andre Walker</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> I’m interested in beauty and connecting that through time – that’s one guiding principle for me. My work also connects to identity and representing identity, but it’s more about revealing something that is timeless or something that has always been there but hasn’t always been represented or shown in a nuanced way in fashion. That’s what I thought anyway, when I first started thinking about male representation. There are different strands to it, but I believe that beauty can seduce you into an ideology, so it has a role to play in enticing people into a story.</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> The word nuance is interesting because that’s what fashion is all about. Fashion is about appropriation. All of this screaming about cultural appropriation and that blonde girls can’t have cornrows or Black women can’t have blonde hair – it’s totally ridiculous where I come from. Nuance is so important and this is the perfect moment to use the plasticity of this time to our advantage and reshape the narrative towards something more beneficial than entirely racial.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>I love the idea of walking into LVMH and seeing lots of coloured people – by that, I mean different races – yet I love the idea of being surrounded by people who are really great at what they do, even more so than different races. That’s just my personal experience. I’m always looking for the best colours, or the best way to explain myself. It’s a continual search for the best of everything.</p>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> In terms of broadening the spectrum in fashion – which is what I was interested in when I first started out in 2014, 2015 – I think things have changed considerably since then. Things have been evolving and there’s a broader representation within fashion [now]. Compared to my initial starting point, the context has changed, but it’s a constantly evolving landscape.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’m interested in beauty and connecting that through time – that’s one guiding principle for me. My work also connects to identity, but it’s more about revealing something that is timeless or something that has always been there but hasn’t always been represented in a nuanced way in fashion. I believe that beauty can seduce you into an ideology, so it has a role to play in enticing people into a story” – Grace Wales Bonner</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> I’ve never thought about race, unless I was being treated badly by somebody who was unfortunately inclined. When it comes to clothing and fashion, they’re utilities to me, so I never thought about race when it came to design. I grew up in a time when there were designers such as <a href="/tag/yves-saint-laurent">Yves Saint Laurent</a>, [Hubert de] <a href="/tag/givenchy">Givenchy</a>, <a href="/fashion-beauty/11481/watch-this-film-about-radical-1980s-designer-claude-montana-bryonesque-farfetch">Claude Montana</a> and <a href="/tag/thierry-mugler">Thierry Mugler</a> – who were all making use of Black, Asian, Indian and lots of different models. There were also people like Willi Smith and Stephen Burrows. When I think about designers, I don’t think about race, I think about what is good – I refuse to be distracted by things such as race. Looking at the past is one thing and it can be helpful, because it clearly helps outline and identify inequality and injustice, which is great, but we can’t continue to live in the logic of unforgiveness forever. I’ve struggled with that for a while, but it doesn’t work in life or in fashion.</p>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> Something I think about is just having the space to develop things in a playful way. I do feel like I need to protect or shield myself so I can have a little bit of room. The world in some way, especially in terms of narratives, can be framed differently or taken somewhere else, but ultimately it’s personal expression. It should be more about having the space to create freely.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>AW:</strong> It’s a very strange time we’re living in right now. We just have to watch what we’re actually believing and thinking and not just take things for granted. I don’t like the idea of being dragged into something or put in a box – designers, artists and creators are meant to be free.</p>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> That’s something that I really admire when I see your work, and it’s something that can’t be traced. Everything you’ve talked about in the sense of what you value and it not being pinned down is really powerful.</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> That’s how I feel about your work, too, and I loved your last collection, by the way. You’ve done a great job at establishing yourself and you’re still a young girl – I’m twice your age. So kudos to you and kudos to me. I should be dead by now because of my ridiculous lifestyle, but it’s a total blessing to be here still.</p>
<p>I’ll send you my phone number so you can text me whenever you get freaked out. I’ll send you something ridiculous and make you laugh and you’ll think, “OK, I’ve got this.” With everything that’s taken place in my life, I would say keep going. You’ve established yourself so beautifully that you can just keep going, going, going – don’t be afraid.</p>
<p><strong>GWB:</strong> For me, the goal is really to have the resources to create everything I imagine, and I hope for the same for younger generations, too. I hope that they will have access to the resources necessary to create at a certain level and will be ambitious with that. I hope that even older ideas of beauty will be celebrated, and that older and newer ones both have a place in the future.</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> I’d like to have a place as well – I don’t stop looking for work. What I hope for fashion, though, is that people really start to review themselves. They can be so enamoured with the history and ideals of fashion that it can become stale. Fashion is sometimes so fleeting, too, so I really like the idea of having something to hold on to, like a treasure, instead of throwing stuff away. How can we get it to be more logical, practical, reasonable and sustainable? Those are my goals and that’s why I’m still working. If I were to express my personal wish, I’d say that I want to be immersed in what I do best and have the opportunity to do it. I won’t give up until I’m in a coffin – my dreams are endless. I dream of being the head of <a href="/tag/hermes">Hermès</a> and I will never, ever stop.</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>“Disgusting,” reads one review of <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/podcasts/nice-white-parents-serial.html"><em>Nice White Parents</em></a></strong>. “Horrible podcast by extremely racist people,” reads another. “Let’s blame white people for everything,” writes I.Jones_95. “A self -loathing white lady blaming white people for first-world problems” says Mrdudesirmanguyhim. One author, writing under the name JJRooster used the full character limit for their Apple Podcast review to repeat the word “Racist” 92 times in a telling post titled simply, “Racist”.</p>
<p>None of these users had listened to a single episode of the show. The podcast, a <em>Serial</em> and <em>New York Times</em> production hosted by <em>This American Life</em>’s Chana Joffe-Walt, didn’t release its first episode until July 30 this year. The final episode didn’t air until August 20. Mrdudesirmanguyhim, I.Jones_95, JJRooster and a flurry of other one-star reviewers were spurred to action by the release of a two-minute, 54-second trailer which debuted on July 17. An audio clip, less than three minutes long, was all it took to draw the enraged scrutiny of a hoard of right-wing trolls. “That shocked me at first,” says <em>Nice White Parents</em>’ producer Julie Snyder. “I remember I sent Chana an email that just said, ‘I think we walked into the middle of someone else’s culture war.’”</p>
<p>Just days before the fateful release of <em>Nice White Parents’</em> trailer, President Trump had delivered a dark and divisive speech, rallying his supporters to battle against what he saw as “a new far-left fascism”. “Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,” said the President. Without realising it, <em>Nice White Parents</em> had become one of a host of cultural objects that offered proof of the new liberal dogma – one that prioritised white guilt over the glossy, rose-tinted story of American exceptionalism. “A wave came over that felt like, ‘Oh my gosh!’” says Snyder. “Sarah [Koenig, host of <em>Serial</em>] wrote me a really nice note after the trailer came ou that just said, ‘I’m here and this is going to be more attention than you’re used to ... please reach out to me to talk about it anytime.’ That felt very nice,” adds Joffe-Walt.</p>
<p>Then, almost as quickly as it had flared up, it was gone. The uproar lasted for only a handful of days. Snyder isn’t quite sure why, but suggests that a combination of short attention spans and a realisation that this was in fact a show that focused its criticisms on <em>liberal</em> white people, caused the swell of hatred to lose steam. Despite occasional comments for the podcast to “quit being racist” – which still continue to crop-up in rogue one-star reviews – listeners and critics alike have universally lauded <em>Nice White Parents</em>, and rightly so. It is without doubt one of the most timely, astonishing and insightful podcasts released in recent years. Joffe-Walt’s reporting is gripping and excruciating in equal measure as she spotlights the missteps and micro-aggressions of seemingly ‘progressive’ white parents in their quest to improve their local school system.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>More than five years in the making, Joffe-Walt began reporting <em>Nice White Parents</em> back in 2015. Working with <em>New York Times Magazine</em> writer Nikole Hannah-Jones on what would become the Peabody Award-winning <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/562/the-problem-we-all-live-with-part-one"><em>The Problem We All Live With</em></a>, she began making some preliminary recordings at Cobble Hill’s School for International Studies (S.I.S.) in her home neighbourhood of Brooklyn, New York. Ultimately S.I.S. wouldn’t feature in <em>The Problem We All Live With, </em>but Joffe-Walt kept returning to the school to see if she could catalogue the ways integration was impacting the lives of parents and students as it played out in real time. “I tracked what happened, and that made me curious about the history of the school,” she says. Once she’d found out exactly what that history entailed, she knew she had to push further. “When Chana found the letters,” says Snyder, “I felt like, OK, we genuinely have a story to tell.”</p>
<p>Written in 1963, almost exclusively by white parents, the letters Joffe-Walt had uncovered demanded that New York City build S.I.S. nearer to the district’s white neighbourhoods. “It’s a decade after Brown versus Board of Education,” they said. “Schools should be integrated.” The Board of Education agreed, changed the entire plan and located S.I.S. where the white parents wanted it. When S.I.S. finally opened its doors, none of the white parents sent their kids there. The astonishing inconsistency of this decision struck Joffe-Walt and Snyder. “You had people calling for integration,” says Snyder, “but that did not happen.” The focus for the series became clear – “How are we still in the same place 60 years later?”</p>
<p>In the beginning, as she had while working on <em>The Problem We All Live With</em>, Joffe-Walt thought that integration was the primary issue her story would explore. “I really was pretty focused on segregation, and the need for public schools to be integrated,” she says. “I’d become fairly convinced that segregation was this fundamental fact that was shaping all these other discussions about the problems with public education.” It wasn’t until she was much further in development that Joffe-Walt began to recognise a different driving force in America’s school systems. During the course of her reporting, she and Snyder met with sociologist, scholar and poet Eve Ewing to discuss an early draft of what would become <em>Nice White Parents</em>. “I remember walking her through the story as far as we knew,” says Joffe-Walt. “Telling her what had happened at the school and Eve just saying, ‘Why are you so obsessed with integration? What is it about integration that you find so compelling?’ That was a very challenging question that both of us kept coming back to over and over again.”</p>
<p>As she gradually turned away from integration, Joffe-Walt began to explore another force that she thought might be influencing America’s unequal education – a force that would eventually lend its name to the podcast. “I looked at the way white parents moved through the schools; what they said they wanted; and the insidious ways in which those choices shaped the conditions in a school building over so many years, even years when white parents weren’t present.” The more she investigated, the more seemingly benign observations – PTA fundraising, ‘gifted’ programmes, school discipline, district boundaries, all things that at first glance seem like sensible, practical necessities – end up entrenching a system that privileges white kids at the expense of Black and brown children.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>As she pursued this new angle, Joffe-Walt became increasingly conscious of her identity and its implications for the story she was telling. “It was evident to me that it was important to say who I was relative to the story,” she says. “That I identify with lots of the white parents in this series, that I am a white parent, that these are all questions I’ve thought a lot about too and that’s what makes me interested in it.” She needed the listener to know how she was relating to the material – it would be untenable for her to tell the story of <em>Nice White Parents </em>without acknowledging her own perspective on its subject matter. “Part of the thread that is carrying you through the episodes is the questions that I’m bringing to what I’m seeing,” she says. “I talk about my own experience when it helps move the story along.”</p>
<p>Sitting moments of hope, side-by-side with the unavoidable acknowledgement that S.I.S.’s history seems doomed to repeat itself, <em>Nice White Parents </em>teeters between optimism and skepticism across five unpausable episodes. “A lot changed over the time I was reporting this story,” says Joffe-Walt. “A lot changed in the consciousness and awareness of liberal progressive white parents and our understanding of our own relationship to systemic racism,” she says. “We’re talking more, and making some different choices, but I’m not sure how that leads to any sort of fundamental change. The actual material circumstances on the ground seem to be moving in the opposite direction, towards increased inequality.” Perhaps the most intriguing reaction Joffe-Walt now sees online are comments from people who say they’re “cringing listening”. That’s a feeling she understands to some degree. “I think that means you recognise yourself,” she says. “Maybe it’s a useful feeling to lean into, and to use to push towards creating change.”</p>

<p>Yesterday evening, American designer Matthew Williams presented his inaugural collection as creative director of <a href="/tag/givenchy"><strong>Givenchy</strong></a> via a series of images photographed by artist Heji Shin. Melding the subversive, utility-led clothing of 1017 ALYX 9SM, the brand Williams founded and continues to design for, with the sleek luxury of the storied Parisian house, it heralded the beginnings of a sharply focused new chapter: “a ‘sampler’ of what is to come,” as the collection notes described.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Williams said that the <a href="/tag/springsummer-2021">Spring/Summer 2021</a> collection – created amid worldwide lockdowns earlier this year – begun with its ‘hardware’, the metal attachments and fastenings on clothes and accessories which have long fascinated the designer (at his own label, his ‘rollercoaster’ buckle is a signature; at Kim Jones’ Dior he designed buckles which now adorn the latest iteration of the house’s ‘saddle’ bag, among other pieces). “Eschewing gendered notions of jewellery and accessories, rather it is hardware that unites the women and men of Givenchy, a symbolic nexus of utility and luxury and the place where this collection began,” said the house.</p>
<p>Here, he settled on the padlock for exploration, an idea first inspired by the thousands of padlocks left by love-struck couples on Paris’ Le Pont des Arts. Titled ‘The Lover’s Lock’ – “a unisex object of utility, decoration, commitment and emotion; a sincere yet playful symbol of Paris” – this padlock hardware punctuated the collection, utilised as a fastening on a series of oversized leather handbags, or hanging from belts like precious charms. The latter cleverly elevated the utilitarian object to the kind of romantic, decorative flourish befitting a haute couture house.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Elsewhere, like he does so adeptly at ALYX, Williams swung between clean-lined tailoring – an early section of monochrome black and off-white suiting suggested perhaps the greatest imprint of house founder Hubert de Givenchy’s fastidious elegance – and something altogether more undone, garments slashed and crumpled, or daubed with cracked layers of paint. Sportswear elements were interspersed: whether roomy parka pullovers in leather or densely embellished sweatshirts, or the series of practical thick-soled plastic sliders or clogs (less practical, but no less appealing were <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CF76HCvFc1L/">the much-Instagrammed “three-toed” sandals</a>, or horn-heeled pumps, the latter inspired by Alexander McQueen’s tenure at the house).</p>
<p>“You find the pieces of the puzzle for a collection, building it from symbols and signs, but never forgetting the reality of the person who will wear it and bring it to life,” said Williams. “The women and men should be powerful and effortless, equal and joyful, a reflection of who they really are – only more so. It’s about finding the humanity in luxury.”</p>]]>

<p>When Dutch designer <strong>Duran Lantink</strong> graduated from the Sandburg Instituut, an esteemed postgraduate programme for visual artists in Amsterdam, he devised a digital book of 100 upcycled designs, creating looks that saw labels yoked together to form new, hybrid clothes, such as a digitally manipulated Givenchy x Ellery draped onyx gown. Three years later, Lantink, who is committed to combating overconsumption through upcycling, is no longer draping an Ellery gown on a computer screen, but with its founder, <strong>Kym Ellery</strong>, standing next to him. The duo’s collaboration launches at a unique moment in fashion history, when many people are calling for the industry to slow down and rethink its most unsustainable practices. Theirs makes for a refreshing collaboration, thanks to its eco-conscious focus: Lantink has reworked a number of items from Ellery’s archives to create a new collection.</p>
<p>“Duran and I both feel that something’s wrong with the industry and we’re really connected on that – we wanted to create something together,” offers Ellery, who founded her eponymous label in 2007 in Australia and is now based in Paris. Meeting over a year ago through a mutual friend, the pair made the most of the slower pace brought about the pandemic as an opportunity to begin reducing production output and create something meaningful. Ellery sought to react to the changing state of the industry by embracing Lantink’s sustainable ethos, and began the collaboration by trawling through her brand’s archives.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“Kym gave me around 150 pieces in the studio to work with, from digital images to searching through boxes and boxes of clothes from years ago,” Lantink explains. Embracing his sustainable ethos – Lantink describes himself as a stock-free organisation – the unlikely pairing discovered their correlative approach to design through a digital angle. “Duran works a lot on Photoshop and so do I, so it was quite interesting that we shared that in common,” notes Ellery. From her apartment in Paris to Lantink’s studio in Amsterdam, the duo availed themselves with open arms to technology, bringing their collection about through Zoom calls and WhatsApp, and eventually, with the easing of lockdown, a train journey between the capitals. “We’ve admired one another from afar before but the actual decision to press go happened during confinement,” shares Ellery.</p>
<p>“I think it’s very important for brands and communities alike to see that archive pieces or garments that haven’t been sold can be transformed into something new,” Lantink says of what the pair intend to achieve with the collaboration. “This should be the new way because the amount of production doesn’t make any sense anymore. It’s not right for this time. I really hope people start understanding that using is the new chic: the new forward.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p>Showcasing spliced trench coats alongside staple tea dresses and luxuriant column gowns, the collaboration marks Lantink’s first venture with a single brand. “Normally I’m repurposing different identities with multi-brand stores, which is somehow easier to transform into something completely new; you’re not really digging into every single ideology or every single brand identity. But with this collaboration, that was kind of different – you have 150 pieces but each garment is hanging there as one family. You have to learn to compromise your own vision to communicate the other identity. But I really enjoyed having a dialogue with someone else because normally it’s just me designing on the computer. This time, there was really an open discussion about it.”</p>
<p>The unique nature of this collaboration positions a new milestone for partnerships between designers. In acknowledgement of their two practices, the pair have embraced their differences by shooting two separate stories for the collection; one set among the grandeur of a Parisian garden, the other an exhilarating trip down a rabbit hole. “We present ourselves very differently aesthetically, so it’s really fun to see how each of us would interpret the same garment,” they explain. “This collaboration is a way for more people to rely on one product,” says Lantink. The collection, especially considering the context in which it’s being released, works to inspire a change. “To continue as before?” says Ellery. “It’d be disrespectful to the artisans and the many, many hands involved in the industry. From people being secretive about things being burnt and even the way that goods are treated in certain stores. We should be reconsidering what actually is responsible in this day and age, and what’s more respectful not just to the environment but also to one another. We need to question our reality. We need to rejuvenate.”</p>]]>

<p>In the middle of Paris Fashion Week, the city has lost one of its longest standing contemporary designers: <strong>Kenzo Takada</strong>, who was born in Japan and had lived in Paris since 1964, died yesterday at the age of 81 after contracting the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Fashion is not for the few – it is for all the people. It should not be too serious,” Takada told the <em>New York Times</em> in 1972. Takada’s exuberant designs brought a new energy to Parisian fashion, where in 1970 he opened his first shop and showed his first collections under the controversial name ‘Jungle Jap’. “I knew it had a pejorative meaning, but I thought if I did something good, I would change the meaning,” he would say of name to the <em>New York Times</em>, and he later renamed his label Kenzo. In his first store in Galerie Vivienne, Takada sold his clothing alongside trinkets collected from his travels around the world – he arrived in Paris in 1964 by boat, stopping at Singapore, Mumbai and Spain – and painted the walls with floral scenes inspired by Henri Rousseau. </p>
<p>Takada was celebrated for his varied and vivacious approach to fashion, his playful shows and covetable clothing. “Fashion is like eating, you shouldn’t stick with the same menu,” he famously said. A tome entitled <em>Kenzo Takada</em> was published by ACC Art Books last year, and traced his pioneering and acclaimed career via photography, personal ephemera and sketches. Written by friends of the designer Kazuko Masui and Chihiro Masui, the book explored his seminal designs, which might take influence from the Japanese kimono, Indian Nehru suits or Middle Eastern turbans, such was Takada’s far-reaching and open approach to fashion design. </p>
<p>After a successful career at the helm of his namesake label, Takada retired from fashion in 1999 (Kenzo is today helmed by Felipe Oliveira Baptista, and owned by the luxury conglomerate LVMH). “It is with immense sadness that Kenzo has learned of the passing of our founder,” the fashion house Kenzo said in a statement. “For half a century, Mr. Takada has been an emblematic personality in the fashion industry – always infusing creativity and colour into the world. Today, his optimism, zest for life and generosity continue to be pillars of our Maison. He will be greatly missed and always remembered.”</p>]]>

<p><em>This article is published as part of a series of </em><a href="/designer-interviews"><em>Designer Interviews</em></a><em>, where we’re speaking to some of the industry’s most crucial voices about this current – and highly unique – moment in fashion history.</em></p><p>Like the rest of the world, <strong>Maria Grazia Chiuri</strong> has spent much of 2020 in lockdown and her work for <strong>Christian Dior</strong> has adapted, evolved and changed – to match the changed mood of the times. Her Autumn/Winter 2020 haute couture collection was ingeniously executed on a minute scale – to allow Dior’s atelier workers to create the clothes at home. Her Spring/Summer 2021 collection, however, was full-sized and staged in a space specially erected in the Tuileries gardens in the heart of Paris – albeit with an audience newly socially-distanced, and wearing Dior masks. “The initial idea was to have a small audience – but at the same time we are living in a moment that is very difficult,” Chiuri said, a few days before her show. She was seated in the Dior studio, broadcast to a group of journalists by Zoom – the new way to preview designer collections. “Everyday the protocol changes, for shows, for travel. It’s very difficult. That’s the only thing that is clear, for me.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>The history of Dior is tied up with fashion reflecting fundamental cultural shifts: the New Look of 1947 was an antidote to both the restrictions of wartime, and the ‘masculinisation’ of women, dressed like soldiers in sharp-shouldered tailored jackets. Christian Dior’s clothes were romantic and escapist – but they were absolutely a response to the time. For Chiuri, our difficult times today call for easier clothes. “We are changing our style of life,” she said. “We want something desirable, but more comfortable. It is evident that our life is completely different. So I try to translate the feeling that I have around me, what I see around the women that I know.” Chiuri’s clothes have always been anchored in reality – often, she asks her 24-year-old daughter Rachele Regini what she would wear, and what she wants to wear. And alongside the cultural and socioeconomic upheavals wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, there has been a measurable change on how people dress.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, why they dress. “It was very hard for me to start a new collection now that our style of life is completely different from the past,” Chiuri commented. “I really believe that it’s very important in this moment to give a collection the message that if you dress in these clothes you feel confident, well with your body. My point of view now is that it’s a more intimate relationship that you have with your clothes. Because you’re alone, now, at home, at the office. So our relationship with clothes is different, it’s more intimate.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>This Dior collection took collage as a main theme: ideological, rather than literal, although there were juxtapositions of fabrics and cuts. “Germano Celant wrote ‘To cut is to think,’” Chiuri said. “Collage doesn’t mean only to mix – collage means, also, for me, to bring together different ideas, reflections for the future.” With Dior, of course, that includes a reference to a storied past: Chiuri alighted on a paletot jacket designed by Dior for his final collection of Autumn/Winter 1957. Softer, easier, it literally takes the stuffing out of the sculpted Bar jacket – although Chiuri has done that before, too, offering it in lightweight, elastic wools and even knit. “In this moment it is very important to create a collection – to create clothes – where your body feels at home,” she says.</p>
<p>As with every discussion with every designer, conversation quickly and inevitably shifted from the collection to the state of the world, and the state of fashion. “It was more difficult when I started to work on this collection than during the lockdown,” Chiuri said, with some exasperation in her voice. “During the lockdown we worked very hard, because there was hope that we would find the solution for September. But when we came back and saw the situation was the same – almost worse – it was not easy to start again, to think about the show. Immediately, our thoughts were: ‘we have to make a video, a digital film, a real show.’ Those were the questions we asked all the time. We decided to realise a classic collection – a building in the Jardin des Tuileries, with an audience. Also in the office to maintain the protocol is really difficult: we tested people coming back after holidays, people that work with me. We found some positive, they had to quarantine. Everyday, is this way. Everyday. At the same time, we reflect. We can be safe, to try to make something, but we are open all the time to change. Because nothing is sure, nothing is simple.”</p>]]>

<h2>Exhibitions</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://helmut-newton-foundation.org/en/"><em>America 1970s/80s</em> at the Helmut Newton Foundation, Berlin: October 9, 2020 – May 16, 2021</a><br /></strong>Photography by Evelyn Hofer, Sheila Metzner, Joel Meyerowitz and Helmut Newton from the 1970s and 80s feature in new exhibition <em>America 1970s/80s</em>, opening this month at the Helmut Newton Foundation in Berlin. The exhibition draws on some of the photographers’ most celebrated works: from Newton’s photography for American <em>Vogue</em> and Meyerowitz’s series <em>Provincetown</em> to Hofer’s images of New York City in the late 1960s and 70s and Metzner’s intimate photographs of Helmut and June Newton in France.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong><a href="https://thegalleryat.com/exhibitions/while-night-comes-on-gently/"><em>While Night Comes on Gently</em> at The Gallery @, Los Angeles: until November 7, 2020</a><br /></strong>The title of LA-based photographer Clifford Prince King’s new exhibition, <em>While Night Comes on Gently</em>, is taken from <em>Dream Variations</em>, a poem by Langston Hughes. “The poem is about his dreams to live carefree without the burden of racial discrimination and inequality,” <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/50534/1/clifford-prince-king-photographs-when-night-comes-on-gently-black-male-desire">Prince King recently told Dazed</a>. “The joy, pain, and understanding within this two stanza poem is absolutely timeless. Hughes’ language has always been my escape: warm and nostalgic.” Prince King captures shared moments of intimacy and vulnerability between himself and a community of Black, queer men, his photographic signature a dusky warm light.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

A Retrospective</em> at The Photographers’ Gallery, London: October 9, 2020 – January 24, 2021</a><br /></strong>A forthcoming retrospective will look at the extraordinary career of photographer Sunil Gupta, marking his first major UK retrospective. “I photograph what’s around me, what’s happening to me, and this central question of, ‘What does it mean to be a gay man of Indian origin?’ That’s what stuck with me most of my life and it’s never really gone away,” <a href="/art-photography/12821/sunil-gupta-nick-sethi-from-here-to-eternity-lovers-ten-years-on">Gupta told fellow photographer Nick Sethi</a> in a recent conversation for AnOther. The Photographers’ Gallery’s retrospective <em>From Here to Eternity</em> features work from throughout Gupta’s career, spanning documentary series, street photography and portraits.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

This month, as museums in the city reopen, the anticipated exhibition opens at the end of this month. Looking back to 1870 and tracing fashion until the present day, <em>About Time</em> will look at fashion’s relationship to the idea of ‘duration’ and temporality, all “ghost narrated” by Virginia Woolf.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Sepuya’s intimate, studio-shot photographs examine queerness and Blackness through various layers – his subjects are often partially obscured by mirrors, black curtains and photographic equipment – through looking at “how the body carries history and performs and negotiates itself,” <a href="/art-photography/12420/conversations-from-isolation-paul-mpagi-sepuya-and-grace-wales-bonner">Sepuya explained to AnOther</a> earlier this year, in conversation with the fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner. Sepuya has also launched a second round of his fundraising initiative <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFlNuXIFi14/">Solidarity Print</a>: people are invited to email donation receipts to Sepuya in exchange for a print, this time until the day of the US election on November 3 and raising money for voting rights and Black community organisations.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

The fair’s usual programme of talks and exhibitions will still be present, as well as Photo London’s celebrated ‘Discovery’ section, where emerging galleries and image-makers are celebrated.

Brackens’ textile pieces – which explore themes of home, the Southern states of America, childhood memories, Black history and queer identity – incorporate a variety of techniques and genres from West Africa, Europe and the United States. “It just felt like a good time to think about the Apocalypse, so I was taking that as my initial jumping-off point, as well as I was thinking about black cowboys, thinking about the American South,” the artist has said of the works featured in <em>darling divined</em>.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

The show examines some of the codes that Chanel pioneered throughout her career, and have since become integral elements of fashion history: from the little black dress and tweed suits to two-tone pumps and quilted bags.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong><a href="https://facetoface.photos/"><em>Face to Face</em> at King’s Cross Tunnel, London: October 7 – November 1, 2020</a><br /></strong>A new public exhibition in London is curated by Ekow Eshun – author of the recently published <a href="https://thamesandhudson.com/africa-state-of-mind-contemporary-photography-reimagines-a-continent-9780500545164"><em>Africa State of Mind: Contemporary Photography Reimagines a Continent</em></a> – and features social and documentary photography by eight different image-makers: Alejandro Cartagena, Margaret Courtney-Clarke, Medina Dugger, Mahtab Hussain, Dhruv Malhotra, Sabelo Mlangeni, George Osodi, and Kyle Weeks. Exhibited in the King’s Cross Tunnel, <em>Face to Face</em> has been organised in partnership with the <a href="https://globalhumanrights.org/en_gb/">Fund for Global Human Rights</a> and features photography created in areas that benefit from its work around the world, from Africa and South Asia to Southeast Asia and Latin America. According to Eshun, “the exhibition conjures compelling images that, as the philosopher Gilles Deleuze put it, create ‘impressions which force us to look, encounters which force us to interpret, expressions which force us to think’.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

Thierry’s black and white portraits capture vivacious and energising scenes, reflective of the celebratory communities he encounters. The series, though, came about after the suicide of the photographer’s brother: as such, Thierry has dedicated <em>Opulence</em> “to all those who are not yet able to be true to their sexual identity”.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

The films, each two minutes long, mark the first public commission from new platform Circa, for which different artists will take over the Piccadilly Circus screens for two minutes each evening for the rest of the year. “The project begins from the year I was born through to the current, unceasing pandemic threatening the human condition globally,” explains Weiwei of the films he’ll be screening throughout October. “All visual material is produced by my studio. There will be a selection of quotes taken from my own writing, as well as from other writers and poets. We will provide a visual feast with a strong message for the public.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

      <![CDATA[






<p>The depiction of mental illness on screen – especially when it comes to schizophrenia and psychosis – is usually glib; the “mad genius”, the beautiful woman who’s “cracked”, the rampaging killer who hears voices, all too familiar archetypes. But as anyone with any experience of such illnesses will tell you, these portrayals are, at best, predictably shallow and, at worst, horribly stigmatising. Which is why <strong><em>Eternal Beauty</em></strong>, the new film from Welsh actor and director <strong>Craig Roberts</strong>, is such a welcome breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>It tells the story of Jane (Sally Hawkins), a wonderfully strong and characterful woman living with paranoid schizophrenia, and traces the highs and lows of her life over the course of a year with humour, warmth and poetic verisimilitude.</p>
<p>The movie is Roberts’ second feature film and has been a long time in the making. “I started writing it when I was editing my first film (<em>Just Jim</em>) in 2015 and I didn’t really know what I wanted to write,” the talented 29-year-old, who rose to fame as the awkward teenage protagonist in Richard Ayoade’s 2010 indie drama <em>Submarine</em>, tells AnOther. “I have somebody in my life that has experienced similar themes to the character in this movie and I was fascinated by this woman and wanted to explore how she navigated her way through the world.”</p>
<p>Roberts’ initial attempts to do so left him unsatisfied. “The first draft was very different. It was a lot darker,” he says. “There was no comedy really. I think almost everything I’d been exposed to surrounding this theme was a horror film where the person living with some form of schizophrenia is possessed or seen as damaged. I was afraid to put humour in it at first and to stay true to what I knew, but I’m so glad I did. There was this question, I suppose, of whether we could change the outlook on this perceived weakness and make it more of a strength really, as opposed to somebody being a victim.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>And there’s no doubt that that’s exactly what he and Hawkins – who played his mother in <em>Submarine</em>, and for whom he wrote the role – accomplished. “Sally and I spent two years talking to each other and sending ideas around – be it colours, movie references, songs or paintings. So she knew the character very well by the time we started shooting,” Roberts explains of the actor’s remarkably nuanced and sensitive performance. “We knew what we wanted to create, so when we stepped on set and Sally was this character, I think it was a lot clearer for everybody else.”</p>
<p>Jane is a woman you can’t help but fall for, not least because she’s so unabashedly herself. Early on in the film, dressed in her signature outfit of white heels at least two sizes too big for her and a beige, complexion-draining trench coat, she heads for Christmas lunch at her parents’ house, her arms laden with presents. Upon arriving, she announces that, this year, bored of socks and soap, she has purchased her own gifts for her dysfunctional family to give her. She hands each of them a receipt before opening the presents with feigned surprise and genuine delight.</p>
<p>Jane’s wit and playfulness is contrasted with bouts of heart-wrenching sadness and anxiety – stemming from a series of scarring rejections in her youth, which triggered her mental illness – as well as disorienting episodes of psychosis when she decides to stop taking her pills. At every turn, we’re presented with life through Jane’s eyes – hers is an otherworldly universe in which she drinks bright blue drinks through a straw and watches strange, outdated adverts on television, bringing to mind the work of Charlie Kaufman or Michel Gondry.</p>
<p>We journey with her as she remembers painful flashbacks from her formative years (where she is played by rising star Morfydd Clark), lived out with her two sisters, her silent, resigned father and her brittle mother (the ever excellent Penelope Wilton). We witness her excruciating doctor’s appointments with a physician who will accept nothing less than a declaration of complete contentedness from his patients (as per the mysterious painting in his office, titled <em>In My Oils</em> – a Welsh phrase denoting the sheer delight in being surrounded by what pleases you). And we observe her encounters with a kooky fellow patient (David Thewlis) and the whirlwind love affair that ensues – replete with guitar serenading (“Jane, you’re my cocaine”) and awkward sex – much to the dismay of her caring older sister Alice (Alice Lowe).</p>
<p>Our experience of Jane’s shifting states is enhanced by the film’s kaleidoscopic camerawork and clever use of colour and lighting to transform its spaces according to Jane’s perception of them. To achieve the right look and feel of the film, Roberts says he showed his crew a number of films, including citing Paul Thomas Anderson’s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>, Ingmar Bergman’s <em>Through a Glass Darkly</em> and Krzysztof Kieślowski’s <em>Three Colours: Blue</em>, as well as some early Scorsese camera tricks, for reference.</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="J2mZiBw_IkE"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J2mZiBw_IkE" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>“The camera movements had to be motivated by the character,” Roberts explains. “I wanted to put pressure on the character, so the camera would zoom into the protagonist a lot, or would whip to her when she least expected it, to add to her sense of anxiety. I wanted it to feel like we could be with her the whole time,” he adds. “I especially never wanted anybody to be laughing at Jane, I wanted them to be laughing with her. She’s wicked in places and that’s something we should be behind.”</p>
<p>The modest and affable Roberts – who is currently working on his forthcoming comedy-drama <em>The Fantastic Flitcrofts, </em>about the British golfer and plucky hoaxer Maurice Flitcroft (to be played by Mark Rylance) – is keen to stress how much he “lucked out” with his cast. “I didn’t have to do much as a director – just make sure that camera was turning,” he laughs. And, while he’s evidently a natural when it comes to both writing and filmmaking, there’s no denying the collective power of his ensemble. Each character has their own flaws and struggles, and each actor is perfectly cast to convey them, from Billie Piper’s hilarious turn as Jane’s shameless younger sister to Wilton’s ice-cool yet caring portrayal of the materfamilias to Thewlis’ perfect balance of charm and self-absorption.</p>
<p>In many ways, in fact, Jane is the film’s most grounded character. As everyone else prattles on about being in their oils, while appearing unremittingly miserable, she’s busy asking, “What if there’s no such thing as happiness, just moments of not being depressed?” And while they all struggle to hide their evident feelings of loneliness and betrayal, Jane confronts her own tribulations with humour: “People think I must be lonely but that’s not true – I’ve got people talking to me all day.” The result is a truly uplifting and invigorating film that, just like its protagonist, is full of daring and heart.</p>
<p>“I hope its message is that you should be kind to people,” says Roberts as our conversation draws to a close. “It’s about understanding someone else’s situation and that, of course, life is very hard so you just need to take every day as it comes, figure out what your superpower is and try and use that for good.”</p>
<p><em>Eternal Beauty is </em><em>in cinemas nationwide and on demand from October 2, 2020.</em></p>]]>

<p>Working in collaboration with non-profit organisation Creatives For Lebanon, which formed in the wake of the blast, with the aim of rebuilding the creative community in Lebanon, Beirut Re–Store will launch a special collection of bespoke items later this month, created to honour the country. This collection will include items by brands including Alaïa, Asai, Dior, Heron Preston, Jean Paul Gaultier and Supriya Lele.</p>
<p>The initiative was spearheaded by French-Lebanese sisters Laura and Sophie Tabet, along with Ulysse Sabbagh and fellow Lebanese creatives Flavie Audi and Emilie Kareh, who were moved to act in the aftermath of the explosion.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“We have been humbled by the amount of people that have come forward and answered the call to help Lebanon,” says Laura Tabet. “In these dark times, it’s deeply heartening to witness the artistic community coming together to create a movement that is beyond politics and beyond borders.”</p>
<p>Beirut Re-Store will be restocked on a weekly basis, with funds going directly to the most pressing needs – from shelter for those who have been displaced, and healthcare for those who have been affected physically and mentally, to financial support for small and medium-sized enterprises, which have also been impacted by the blast.</p>

<p>While some designers are forging forward with traditional runway shows – attendees socially distanced and mask-clad – <a href="/tag/jonathan-anderson"><strong>Jonathan Anderson</strong></a> is steadfast in his decision to keep the ritual on pause. “For me it was too soon for us to go back to a show,” he tells AnOther in the days after the presentation of his Spring/Summer 2021 collection for <a href="/tag/jw-anderson"><strong>JW Anderson</strong></a>. “It just seemed to soon for us and I didn’t want anyone to feel left out. Everyone who would be invited to the show normally receives a box at the same time.”</p>
<p>Delivered instead to attendees’ front doors as a colourful bound book – a sequel to his original ‘show in a box’ concept he pioneered during menswear month – it marked a desire for his audience to have a tangible and tactile experience of the new collection, with respect for the current moment (in Paris, where fashion week is currently taking place, the Covid-19 warning level <a href="https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Covid-19-Paris-bars-and-restaurants-risk-closure">looks set to turn “scarlet”</a>, its highest rating). “I wanted a way to connect with people even though we couldn’t have a show and I wanted something tactile; something that felt personal and a way to present the collection that was interactive,” Anderson says.</p>
<p>Arriving in a package wrapped in paper printed with pages from Oscar Wilde’s <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> – Anderson had re-read a number of Wilde’s plays during lockdown, finding them particularly prescient to 2020 – the book inside, bound with silver screws, comprised multiple types of coloured paper, envelopes of photographs, swatches of fabric, as well as the collection’s looks. A brass coin, embedded in the cover (“the instrument that makes the whole experience possible”) could be used to unscrew the binding and release the pages; once loose, Anderson hoped people would rearrange them to recreate a milieu not dissimilar to a runway show, albeit in miniature.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“I wanted something physical that people could interact with. You can look at it right away or next week or come back to it in a month,” says Anderson. “You can cut out the looks and use the coloured paper to make your own kind of backdrops. There is string and holes in all the sheets if you want to hang it up. For me it was important that you can kind of take the show and make it yours.”</p>
<p>The collection itself – an “outburst of lightness ... both metaphorical and real”, as the brand said – saw Anderson swerve between the “martial precision” of uniformed tailoring, and the languid, generous silhouettes which he propositioned in his resort collection earlier this year (“an accumulation of different aesthetic experiences that clash into an harmonious whole”, as the notes described). Decorate flourishes – embroidery, jacquards, jewel embellishment, sprays of feathers and the like – paid ode to the frivolity and poetry of fashion, “the expressive, performative language of dressing”. </p>
<p>Here, speaking in his own words, Jonathan Anderson tells the story behind the Spring/Summer 2021 collection, and why now marks a moment to “embrace and enjoy” change.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“We did the first ‘show in a box’ back in June for men’s and resort and we developed the concept when it felt like half the world was under strict lockdown. I wanted a way to connect with people even though we couldn’t have a show and I wanted something tactile; something that felt personal and a way to present the collection that was interactive. For this season and Chapter Two of the ‘show in a box’ I wanted to continue the theme. For me it was too soon to go back to a show. It just seemed too soon for us and I didn’t want anyone to feel left out. Everyone who would be invited to the show normally receives a box at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>“We [also] produced some digital content that we are posting on Instagram and social media around the collection but I didn’t want to just do a show that we broadcasted. I wanted something physical that people could interact with. You can look at it right away or next week or come back to it in a month. You can cut out the looks and use the coloured paper to make your own kind of backdrops. There is string and holes in all the sheets if you want to hang it up. For me it was important that you can kind of take the show and make it yours.</em></p>
<p><em>“[During lockdown] I went back to some of Oscar Wilde’s plays that I read when I was in school and was re-reading them. He really was the king of one-liners. He had this amazing ability to sum up a moment in time or a thought in a one-liner. And then I came across this quote of his, ‘The secret of life is in art’, which really summed up 2020 for me. It all just made sense.”</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“I think this collection is really about this moment in time and the JW Anderson brand DNA. I think you can see the frivolity in the embellished tops with the intricate beading and feathers that hang down. It felt luxurious, especially this juxtaposition with the cotton jersey. I think escapism can be important and fashion can offer that but I also think it’s equally important to be grounded in the moment and really be realistic about where we are and what we are doing. There is still a pandemic raging and I think we need to be careful in fashion to not be so escapist that it looks like arrogance or like we are ignoring the very real situation the world is in right now.</em></p>
<p><em>“There is a mix of these great tailored peplum blazers in floral jacquard paired with cargo shorts that sit next to silky suede tops and capes and these incredible trenches with big hardware. There is the chain on the chain loafers but also on a woven bucket bag that was inspired by a fisherman’s basket.</em></p>
<p><em>“I think [the lack of traditional fashion week] has given me massive amounts of freedom. We are in a moment where we all need to think differently. I am embracing and enjoying the change. Not rejecting it.”</em></p>]]>

<blockquote>
<p>“The moments of our</p>
<p>life are not expendable,</p>
<p>and the [possible]</p>
<p>circumstances of death</p>
<p>are beyond imagination.</p>
<p>If you do not achieve</p>
<p>an undaunted confident</p>
<p>security now, what</p>
<p>point is there in you</p>
<p>being alive, O living</p>
<p>creature?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– Padmasambhava, <em>The Tibetan Book of the Dead</em></p><p>Homo sapiens first walked the Earth about 50,000 years ago. Since then, more than 108 billion members of our species have been born, according to estimates by the Population Reference Bureau. Given the current global population of about 7.8 billion, those of us currently alive represent about seven per cent of the total number of humans who have ever lived. That means those of us who are still undead are vastly outnumbered by the dead ones.</p>
<p>As I was contemplating these numbers, I learnt of the sudden and tragic death of my close friend and muse. Yet I look at my pictures of him and he comes alive, preserved not only in my memory but in time – just like several other friends I captured who lived too fast and died too young. Photography has the power to transcend time and even death; it’s as much a document as an attempt to conquer our mortality and preserve our physical appearance in its prime.</p>
<p>In <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em> (1890), Oscar Wilde describes in detail the modern-day anxiety associated with the very human process of aging and fear of death. Yet in many cultures and civilisations death has been celebrated, re-enacted in elaborate rituals and presented in everyday life. In the Digital Age, most of us mortals rely on selfies to present our best selves to the outside world. More than ever before, photography has become the main vehicle for our self-image and self-esteem.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>I believe that true art comes from the inner existential crisis that can be addressed but can never be solved. While studying the pictures in Bruce LaBruce’s <strong><a href="https://www.baronbooks.co.uk/death-book"><em>Death Book</em></a></strong>, despite all their shock value, I immediately sense the artist’s urge to raise fundamental questions about human nature, sexuality, mortality, and the function of art in the late capitalist society. Capitalism has turned death, violence, destruction, and perpetual war into the most profitable business model the world has ever seen, on a mass scale never imaged before the industrial revolution.</p>
<p>LaBruce’s post-apocalyptic vision of the modern world is very much in tune with his aesthetic ancestors: Jean Genet who worshipped and glorified sexual outlaws and social outcasts; Georges Bataille who compared orgasm to death and has written extensively about this connection in his book <em>Erotism: Death and Sensuality</em> (1957); and Pasolini who shortly before his brutal murder by an underage hustler condemned the Western model of sexuality: “The sexual freedom of today for most people is really only a convention, an obligation, a social duty, a social anxiety, a necessary feature of the consumer’s way of life” (<em>Corriere della Sera</em>, 1975).</p>
<p>In his often gory and violent sets, LaBruce examines and confronts these sexual and social anxieties. He finds comfort in chaos and beauty in the most transgressive situations where fear no longer exists and morality doesn’t apply. In LaBruce’s parallel universe death is performed as a spectacle, a welcoming transition from the terror of our mundane mortal existence to a higher state where all our individual desires and sufferings are rendered useless. Death becomes him, as a guiding light in the underworld of the undead.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>Slava Mogutin: You work crosses different mediums and disciplines, from cinema, theatre and performance to journalism and photography. Your pictures blend all those creative endeavours into one explosive cocktail. Have you ever studied photography and when did you take your first conscious photograph?</strong></p>
<p>Bruce LaBruce: When I went to York University in Toronto in the 80s, I majored in Film with a minor in Dance. I got a late start as a dancer, not taking classes until I was 17, but I did consider becoming a choreographer. I did subsequently incorporate dance in several of my movies and theatrical pieces, and it has even come in handy for the live performances I “choreograph” at my gallery openings. As a Film major, the first year of undergrad studies included a still photography class, working with 35mm cameras. We had to develop our own negatives and do the developing and blow-ups. I suppose the first “conscious” photos I took were a series of black and white photos of my elder sister for a school assignment. Second year we worked in Super 8, making short films, which was fortuitous because it’s such a generous medium, technically simple and aesthetically satisfying. I was encouraged to continue in film production, but in the third year the medium was 16mm film, which involved a more complicated camera and lighting set-ups, and you were expected to finance half the films yourself. As I was a technophobic fairy and dead broke, I segued into Film Theory and got my undergrad degree. I had always intended from a young age to be a film critic and academic anyway, so I ended up getting a Masters in Film and Social and Political Thought. But during those years I started hanging out in the punk and underground art scenes in downtown Toronto where I met people working in Super 8, so I took that back up and started making short experimental art/porn films, and, eventually, feature films. The Reluctant Filmmaker!</p>
<p><strong>SM: How did the idea of <em>Death Book</em> come about and what’s the concept behind it?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: Matthew Holroyd, the founder of <a href="https://www.baronbooks.co.uk/">Baron Books</a>, approached me to collaborate on the <em>Death Book</em>, the second in a series of books about the relationship of photography to death and how death is portrayed in Western culture. (He did the first one in collaboration with the photographer Edith Bergfors.) As my work often deals in stark and extreme images of violence, gore, splatter and death in all its manifestations, I immediately thought it was a perfect fit for me.</p>
<p><strong>SM: Can you recall your first encounter with death?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: As a sensitive (read: gay) child growing up on a small farm, and having a father who was also a hunter and trapper, I witnessed a lot of carnage that had a profound effect on me – animals being shot with rifles and shotguns and killed or torn apart in fights with hounds, animals in traps chewing off their own legs to escape, mass chicken decapitations, livestock being branded and  castrated with large shears, their genitals painfully cauterised, kittens drowned or asphyxiated, et cetera. When I was five or six my best friend had his first two fingers amputated in a hay auger. Although I rarely participated directly in the bloody carnage, in the summer one chore my brother and I had was to turn over wet bales of hay one by one and stomp the field mice to death with our boots by the hundreds, their guts squirting out of them. Later I referred to them as the chicken and mouse holocausts. Death was abstract to me then; now I can’t kill an insect without guilt. There was once a bad accident right in front of our farm in which a man was killed. When I ran to the scene of the accident, he was lying on his back in the middle of the road, both his socks and shoes knocked off by the impact, his breathing laboured before he took his last breath. It’s a scene that I recreated at the beginning of my movie <em>L.A. Zombie</em>. (Production stills from the scene are included in the <em>Death Book</em>.) In my version, however, the victim is fucked back to life by an alien zombie that rubs his strange penis directly up against his heart. Zombies, porn and gore figure prominently in my work, but it is as much about memory as it is about metaphor.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>SM: The book covers three decades of your photography, and the vast majority of these pictures aren’t suitable for most publications and social media outlets. Can you talk about your most painful and memorable experiences with censorship?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: Like much of my work, this book is suitable for no one, lol. I have been routinely censored from the very beginning. In Toronto in the 90s, the labs where I had my photographs and films processed would call the cops when they saw the sexually violent images. I usually managed to talk them into returning the negs (or diapositives) to me. My work was routinely stopped at the Canadian border, and I would receive notifications with boxes checked to indicate obscenity, pornography, sex with violence, and even sedition. My movies all had to be censored in Britain in order for them to be distributed. <em>Hustler White</em> was banned in British Columbia; <em>L.A. Zombie</em> was infamously banned in Australia. It’s something that I had to become philosophical about, and even learn to wear as a badge of honour.</p>
<p><strong>SM: We both used to shoot for porn mags such as <em>Honcho</em>, <em>Mandate</em>, <em>Playguy</em> and <em>Inches</em>. I was very inspired by your commercial porn because it was pushing the boundaries of the genre in a very radical aesthetic and political direction. I remember how the editor of those mags always complained that your shoots were too hardcore even for them. Where does your fascination with porn come from?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: I also witnessed a lot of breeding and fucking on the cruel farm! My father had both a bore and a bull, these enormous rogue animals bred for breeding, always aggressively fucking their female harem. I guess that was my first experience with porn! It was the 70s so in a rough rural environment I always had to keep my homosexuality, which I was aware of from a very young age, hidden. I was an adorable, sickly ginger sissy with orange ringlets, a bit Little Lord Fauntleroy, and always preferred the company of girls to boys. I also read my older brother’s copies of Henry Miller and William S. Burroughs furtively as a kid. I didn’t lose my virginity until I was 22 or 23 in the 80s, but when I did, it was the Walls of Jericho coming down, the proverbial velvet rage, and I would get fucked by a score of guys at gay saunas in one night like it was the last days of Caligula.</p>
<p>This was during the height of the Aids epidemic, so even though I tried to practise safe sex, there was always an element of anxiety and terror, like a beast stalking you in a horror film. By the time I started making my first short experimental films, I was a punk provocateur, but as a reaction against the homophobia in the punk and skinhead scenes, I started incorporating found gay porn in my movies and subsequently making my own naive queer porn, which I starred in myself. I considered it as much a political gesture, in terms of gay liberation and radicalism, as something pleasurable and erotic.</p>
<p><strong>SM: There’s plenty of gore and violence in your work. Your blood splatter performances, which I had the pleasure of participating in on numerous occasions, are the continuation of the avant-garde tradition of the Viennese Actionists such as Hermann Nitsch blended with the classic Italian gore of Dario Argento. Who else influenced your bloody vision?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: The two examples you’ve mentioned were definitely an influence. My bloody gallery openings and installations at art events, for which I often recreate scenes of terrorist abduction and torture and crime scenes, sometimes incorporating zombies, sometimes not, taking photos and Polaroids of the bloodbaths, is partly an influence of the Viennese Actionists, and partly inspired by the terrorist abduction videos and beheadings that you would see routinely on television and the internet, practically packaged as entertainment. I am also a big fan of gore and splatter films, which are often about sexual anxiety and homosexual panic, especially the first wave of B-movies in the late 60s and through the 70s by the likes of Dario Argento, Romero, Craven, Raimi, Carpenter, and Cohen and Cronenberg, that were partly a reaction to the horrors of the Vietnam War and the death throes of the sexual revolution. But the atmosphere at these events, as you can attest to, is never negative or cynical. Rather, there is an atmosphere of carnival, catharsis and healing, a giddy sense of transgression and fun.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><strong>SM: What functions do porn and gore play in today’s society? And what place do they have in your more recent work?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: Gee, I don’t think I’ll ever get it out of my system! As the world gets crazier and crazier, potentially careening toward annihilation, there’s more need than ever to work out all the anxieties and hysteria and neurosis through art and creativity. Porn has always been a ludic space where people can work out their most outrageous and politically incorrect fantasies. As an unapologetic Freudian, I’ve always recognised the darkness and power of the sexual imagination. If it’s repressed, it becomes deadly and monstrous. Gore and splatter, which are essentially porn with spurting blood instead of ejaculations – the same penetration, the same orgiastic climax, the same jouissance – also serve a cathartic function. Especially when it’s analogue – the fake blood, the squishy, squirming organs. Digital effects tend to create a deadening effect, a flattening out, an embalming that asks for no participation from the audience, just passive consumption. Although I now mostly work in digital, I have a love/hate relationship with this zombie aesthetic, and struggle to bring it back to life.</p>
<p><strong>SM: You’re regarded as a Canadian renegade auteur, agent provocateur, self-proclaimed contrarian and reluctant pornographer. After your MoMA retrospective in 2015, it became apparent that the mainstream culture was now capable of accepting even your radical oeuvre despite its gore, violence and controversy. Is shock value still as important to you as it was in your early queercore days?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: I will always support shock value for its own sake, after John Waters. As Richard Burton, the Angelo De La Morte, in Joseph Losey’s <em>Boom</em>, says (actually, Tennessee Williams): It’s the shock of each moment of still being alive.</p>
<p><strong>SM: What was the most challenging project you’ve ever done? And what’s in your view your greatest artistic accomplishment?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: <em>Saint-Narcisse</em>, the movie I recently completed, was probably the most challenging in terms of the scale of the production and the use of special effects. But I had a decent budget so it was more controlled. There’s nothing quite like guerrilla, no-budget filmmaking, which is how most of my films have been made. It’s sheer adrenalin, lawlessness, and adventurism. As for my greatest artistic achievement, that has yet to be realised.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>SM: Can you talk about specific dead people in the book?</strong></p>
<p>BlaB: Yes. In fact, I would like to dedicate the book to these dead friends and colleagues. The book opens with a photo I took of the actor Brad Renfro and his grandmother, who was his guardian, now both gone. I only spent one very memorable (innocent!) weekend with Brad when he was 17 making a movie in Toronto with Bijou Phillips and Dominique Swain. We all went glow-in-the-dark bowling. I remember him playing guitar in his pyjamas when we were all in a taxi on our way from their hotel to my apartment. He was such a sweet, charming kid. I recall that he freaked out when he saw a framed photo collage/montage of River Phoenix hanging over my kitchen sink, which included a picture of River dead in his coffin that was published in <em>The National Enquirer</em>. When he saw it, he shuddered, as if a goose had walked over his grave. Eight years later, at the age of 25, he also died of a heroin overdose.</p>
<p>On page 11 appears a photo I took of Erik Rhodes, the late porn actor, on the set of my movie <em>L.A. Zombie</em>. I was distressed to hear that he died of steroid and recreational drug abuse two years later. I only worked with him the once, but he was so charming, intelligent, and easy-going, a gentle giant. The final entry on his blog is chilling and instructive, to wit:</p>
<p><em>What’s left to say… we all know this is where i’d end up… how long did you think i could go on playing happy go lucky… i mean, all the pills in the world can’t change the fact that i have lost my passion for almost everything in life and i just don’t care anymore… nothing excites me… i guess flirting with death is the only way to know your alive… i’m not alive… and if i’m dead when this is finally read, well just know i was dead when i wrote this…  i wish i could have been a better brother, son, friend, lover… i just couldn’t. there was nothing anyone could do to help, so don’t bother wasting a second of your life saying “If only i…”</em></p>
<p>On pages 13, 16, and 21 appears my dear friend the artist and graffiti legend Dash Snow of the Irak crew of NYC. We became good friends after I met him through photographer Ryan McGinley, and I used to stay with him on visits to New York when he lived on Avenue C. Sadly, he died of a heroin overdose in 2009, an unfortunate member of the ‘27 Club’.</p>
<p>Genesis P. Orridge and Lady Jaye appear on page 14 in a photo I took on an exuberant night out at the legendary Squeezebox club in NYC. Both have subsequently died, dear Genesis earlier this year. On page 62 you can see my dear friend Will Munro in a Polaroid I took at my opening <em>Polaroid Rage</em> at Gallery 1313 in Toronto in 2006. The legendary Toronto artist and club promoter died of a brain tumour in 2010 at the tender age of 35. On page 42, the man with the fan in the kaftan is my lovely friend Michael Glass, who died far too young of a stroke. The last time I visited him was in a hospital in the LA neighbourhood of Watts when he was incapacitated and unable to speak, but his eyes brightened when I sat beside him. He was one of the smartest and most charming men I’ve ever known. And finally, the last page of the book is dedicated to Nico, the Warhol superstar and music legend, a photo of her headstone that I took on a pilgrimage to her grave in the Grunewald cemetery just outside of Berlin a number of years ago. A lifelong heroin addict, she had kicked the habit but died in Ibiza in 1988 at the age of 49 after falling from bicycle without wearing a helmet.</p>
<p>If anyone else featured in the book has died without me knowing about it, may they and the ones I’ve just mentioned all rest in peace.</p>

<p>In many ways, <a href="/tag/marine-serre"><strong>Marine Serre</strong></a> is a fashion prophetess. The self-described ‘ecofuturist’ designs clothes for the future, clothes that may just enable us to have a future, working in an environmentally friendly way that involves sourcing and upcycling used fabric to produce unique, couture-like garments – garments that she calls ‘futurewear’.</p>
<p>Despite the French designer’s forward-thinking approach to fashion though, she is fully of the moment too, and able to articulate it in a way that few of her contemporaries can rival. She has the propensity to distill the cultural mood – with all its conversations, discussions and debates – into her collections. Deftly and certainly not literally.</p>
<p>Which brings us to her <a href="/tag/springsummer-2021">Spring/Summer 2021</a> collection, debuted this week via a short film entitled <em>Amor Fati</em>. The result of a collaboration with directors Sacha Barbin and Ryan Doubiago, and the composer Pierre Rousseau, the film stars the Iranian-Dutch singer Sevdaliza and the French artist Juliet Merie, a close friend and collaborator of Serre’s.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>The production encapsulates Serre’s response to the outbreak of Covid-19 and the social upheaval that has ensued since: that we should embrace the change, not shy away from it; a response that is reflected in the characters in the film, which “seamlessly mutate as they move through three symbolic environments”.</p>
<p>“In fact, [the past six months] has given us new opportunity on the creative level and a strong encouragement to keep following that path started in 2017,” Serre tells us. “It feels good to be followed – it forces us to get [to] the next steps and to embrace what is coming, even if it’s not always easy.”</p>
<p>Here, Serre elaborates on this, opening up about the creation of this collection and film, her thoughts on these strange times and how her work is a reflection of them.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“Everything was started during confinement; I was [already] considering not doing a show ... so it was an occasion to embrace this change and [also] a moment to think how to do something else. I was already constricted by the limits that a runway show can have – such as a limited amount of people, short amount of time and most importantly the limits of [not being able to] go deeper into the personalities of the characters that walk a show. In </em>Mind Melange Motor<em> [Serre’s previous collection] you could already see that there were defined groups of people and roles, but I needed to explore [that] further. So the film was automatically the first thing that came up in my mind. The next was to figure out how to make it happen. It was still during confinement that we were creatively working via video call and exchanging ideas, and as soon as we could we started to work on the realisation of the film.</em></p>
<p><em>“It was really important for me that the film was spread worldwide, but at the same time equally important for me to work with local artists, and have a close connection and exchange [with the people involved]. We were extremely connected during the creative process, in symbiosis – with the directors of the film, the production and the Marine Serre team that worked on the project. It was really important for me to talk about feelings ... to show deepness after this moment of vacuum.</em></p>
<p><em>“It was a creative exchange; I had no background in cinema, neither Sacha nor Ryan had it in fashion. We both learnt a lot, especially on the technical aspects of this project. We built a lot on each other! The project was very ambitious, as we want to show the garments, but at the same time tell a story with a meaning without dialogue, while building up characters, in a short film, [with a] limited budget – [it was] a project that required a lot of work. We are also perfectionists and I think that helped to reach this result. For me it is a balance between technicity and feelings.</em></p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="XWfNihVW7GI"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWfNihVW7GI" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><em>“[The film] reflects what we are going through, and the existentialism in how we manage feelings in our daily life. Often these emotions and sensations get oppressed and denied. </em>Amor Fati<em> is an invitation to embrace all outcomes, with no judgments. I feel like the approach that I have working for my brand is very similar to this idea. It requires a lot of strength and acceptance of events so to be able to overcome our present in a productive and positive way.</em></p>
<p><em>“The last six months have been very heavy, of course – like for all the rest of the planet. In terms of creativity it is always a balance. For a brand like ours that aims for radical changes in the production line ... this moment of violent change was destabilising but it was something that didn’t make me panic. In fact, it has given us us new opportunity on the creative level and a strong encouragement to keep following that path started in 2017. It feels good to be followed – it forces us to get [to] the next steps and to embrace what is coming, even if it’s not always easy.</em></p>
<p><em>“We were already battling to change the fashion system, and this moment of change makes it easier for us to open doors that before were difficult to open. For us it was quite a creative and a motivating moment to be more recognised and be acknowledged. It generated a lot of energies and encouragement to keep on going, knowing that there is a lot of progress still to be made. For instance, lowering the price of our White line offering, aiming to reach 100 per cent recycled and biodegradable material ... [as well as the] importance of choosing local and European production. These kind of choices have consequences, and it is encouraging to see that everyone is following and we aren’t alone anymore on this path, because the change can happen only if we are many on the same route.”</em></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[






<p>Part of our job, as a magazine, is to converse – with the industry, and ultimately with the reader, to tell our story for the season. AnOther Magazine is always built on discussions, and this issue, more than ever, those have been complex. Because reflecting a time such as this isn’t simple.</p>
<p>Over the past six months our world has changed immeasurably. Both the restrictions brought by the Covid-19 pandemic and the profound political actions resulting from the Black Lives Matter protests across the globe have – rightfully – dominated conversations. This magazine is inevitably shaped around those conversations, the ensuing discussions, the radically engaged debates that continue even as we go to print.</p>
<p>AnOther is also shaped around and inspired by fashion – because this is a fashion magazine and fashion itself is a conversation. Not just within its ranks – its designers speaking with their teams, photographers with stylists, the intimacies shared between models and hair and make-up artists – although, given that all of those conversations have been disrupted, this is a celebration of them, too. On a wider level, fashion is a fundamental and important conversation with the outside world: what we wear is a form of self-portrait, an architecture defining how we wish to be perceived. Not by accident are there so many self-portraits in this issue – the moment engineers them, but they also feel right.</p>
<p>There’s another level to fashion’s conversation: as a creative expression, fashion is timely, first and foremost. Time defines fashion – it was to be the subject of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art’s summer Costume Institute show, now delayed. And to quote Nina Simone (who unsurprisingly came up in more than a few conversations): “You can’t help it. An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times.”</p>
<p>What we have endeavoured to achieve is not a divorce of fashion from the political and societal upheavals we are experiencing, but rather to contextualise fashion within that fundamentally changing landscape. That is intimidating but also exciting, as we can watch our world, potentially, being reshaped for the better.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Great fashion isn’t frivolous. It isn’t vapid. In reflecting humanity’s perceptions of itself, it is keyed with shifts in belief. <a href="/user/CollierSchorr">Collier Schorr</a> has photographed <a href="/fashion-beauty/12803/cover-story-janaya-future-khan-in-conversation-with-janelle-monae">Janaya Future Khan</a> not in their own clothes, but in the designs of a rich cross section of creatives. Khan embraced the opportunity: as international ambassador for Black Lives Matter, their image is a tool to communicate their cause, their body is a vehicle for change. Can fashion amplify that? It not only can – it is its fundamental role, and maybe its greatest achievement to do so. It is why dictators fear fashion and why revolutions use dress as an important tool.</p>
<p>We talked with many fashion designers about this – both for the conversations that structure the magazine, but also because, during times of uncertainty, and indeed isolation, it is human nature to seek solace in community. What were they doing? How were they doing? What are they thinking? Ideas that came up again and again were those of fight or flight – should fashion be dressing us to weather the times or to escape them? In conversation, the designer <a href="/tag/rick-owens">Rick Owens</a> developed this further: “Fashion is always about defence and fantasy, but with this new generation’s expanding consciousness of responsibility, in addition to ‘fight or flight’, perhaps we have added ‘unite’.” Erudite, as always, his words have ended up on the cover, as have his photographs of his wife, <a href="/fashion-beauty/12836/cover-story-michele-lamy-kim-kardashian-rick-owens-kanye-west-paul-kooiker-aw20">Michèle Lamy</a>. They were captured as part of <a href="/fashion-beauty/12836/cover-story-michele-lamy-kim-kardashian-rick-owens-kanye-west-paul-kooiker-aw20">a special project</a> realised during lockdown and directed by the photographer Paul Kooiker, also featuring Kim Kardashian, photographed by her husband Kanye West – a visual attestation to Lamy and Kardashian’s perhaps unlikely friendship.</p>
<p>Inspired by Owens’s words, for this Autumn/Winter issue of AnOther Magazine, the first created this decade, we chose to unite. In the first place, on the eve of its 20th anniversary, <a href="/fashion-beauty/12499/another-magazine-and-another-man-join-forces-dazed-media-news">this magazine has joined forces with Another Man</a>, going back to its roots as a biannual that is gender non-specific, a magazine for all. In so doing, we embrace our own history as a publication that exists across generations: many of our contributors have been with us since the start. They helped delineate our identity, shaping and reshaping it over the years, passing their skills down. <a href="/fashion-beauty/12810/mj-harper-stefano-pilati-random-identities-katy-england-benjamin-huseby">Katy England</a> has created <a href="/fashion-beauty/12810/mj-harper-stefano-pilati-random-identities-katy-england-benjamin-huseby">a collage of people, paintings and fashion</a> close to and moving her; <a href="/user/AlisterMackie">Alister Mackie</a> has curated Document. <a href="/fashion-beauty/12822/cover-story-craig-mcdean-katie-shillingford-emerging-designers-2020">A shoot celebrating emerging designers</a> immediately follows <a href="/fashion-beauty/12808/john-galliano-cover-story-maison-margiela-artisanal-interview-aw20">the extraordinary imagery capturing John Galliano’s Autumn/Winter 2020 Maison Margiela Artisanal collectio</a>n: arguably, no two figures have been more inspirational to future generations. </p>
<p>The stories throughout the issue are named after ballets and operas – centuries-old acts of creative expression, around which people convene. And this is a magazine, a community, around which people have always gathered – we are so grateful, then and now, for their contributions. They not only enrich our history, they have made it. While we always thank people here, under the unique and frightening circumstances of 2020 our thanks take on a new gravity: this magazine could not exist without the passion and love of the image-makers, writers and creatives within its pages. <a href="/user/JaneHow">Jane How</a> made all the clothes for her story, inspired by specific pieces by some of her favourite designers; <a href="/user/KatieShillingford">Katie Shillingford</a> sent her edit of the season to <a href="/user/VivianeSassen">Viviane Sassen</a> in the Netherlands, where she photographed it in nature; <a href="/user/EllieGraceCumming">Ellie Grace Cumming</a> styled <a href="/fashion-beauty/12793/susie-cave-dresses-house-gucci-bloom-alasdair-mclellan-alessandro-michele">Susie Cave</a> at her home in Brighton, in <a href="/tag/alessandro-michele">Alessandro Michele</a>’s collections for <a href="/tag/gucci">Gucci</a>, past and present. I wish I could mention every contributor here – but hope the strength and beauty of this issue, a testament to their work, is a fitting tribute. Thank you, all.</p>
<p>This magazine was put together in the strangest and most difficult of times. The world remains strange and difficult, and doubtless will do for some time. Yet our wish is that in the world, as in these pages, people will find hope, thoughtfulness, truth and, above all, joy.</p>

<p>1. Be inspired – and educated – by <strong>Janaya Future Khan</strong>, the public speaker, teacher, author and international ambassador for Black Lives Matter, who has been tirelessly working for equality for the Black community since they were a teenager. Speaking to <strong>Janelle Monáe</strong>, in a conversation mediated by <strong>Lynette Nylander</strong>, the pair discuss their formative years, the finding and claiming of their identities, the similarities in their shared experience of Blackness, the understanding of privilege and where we can go from here. Khan is photographed by <strong>Collier Schorr</strong> and styled by <strong>Nell Kalonji</strong>.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>2. Delve into a special project realised during lockdown, performed by <strong>Michèle Lamy</strong> and <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong>, conceived and directed by Dutch photographer <strong>Paul Kooiker</strong>– a visual attestation to Lamy and Kardashian’s perhaps unlikely friendship. In the accompanying text, <strong>Stefan Kalmár</strong>, the curator and director of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA), London, meditates on these two extraordinary women, how they relate to each other and to a complex notion of contemporary reality.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>4. Revel in the extraordinary imagery capturing <strong>John Galliano</strong>’s Autumn/Winter 2020 <strong>Maison Margiela</strong> Artisanal collection, imagined by <strong>Willy Vanderperre</strong> and <strong>Olivier Rizzo</strong>. Speaking to <strong>Susannah Frankel</strong>, the inimitable – and ever-influential – designer discusses his 1986 <em>Fallen Angels</em> collection, the Blitz Kids and his experience meeting the famously reclusive Margiela himself.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

The designers include the Central Saint Martins-educated <strong>Tolu Coker</strong> whose appliquéd jacket, featuring her father and Angela Davis, appears on one of the six covers for this issue. “This collection was inspired by my childhood spent growing up on a London council estate,” Coker says, “as well as my late father Kayode Coker’s involvement in fighting for equitable justice for marginalised communities.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </section>
<p><strong>Who is it?</strong> Paris-based jewellery designer <strong>Charlotte Chesnais</strong> launched her eponymous brand five years ago, having previously trained and worked in ready-to-wear. It was while working at Balenciaga alongside Nicolas Ghesquière during his tenure at the storied house that she tried her hand at designing jewellery. “It was not a mistake, but it was very random,” she says over the phone from Paris. “Nicolas was looking to do some jewellery for a show. There was nobody just doing jewellery at that time in the studio, and he asked if I wanted to try something – it was just a matter of a few bracelets. And that’s how I went to an atelier for the first time, and I spent time there and I designed the collection. I loved it and I never stopped.”</p>
<p>Five years since starting her brand, Chesnais’ jewellery – most often crafted in gold, silver or vermeil – is favoured for its fluid designs, sculptural details and idiosyncratic silhouettes. The fact that Chesnais’ jewellery is often described as sculptural comes as no coincidence: during the design process, she sculpts and moulds ideas by hand, working with a paste or piece of metal, rather than sketching. Rings might wrap around a finger and stretch out across others; earrings loop to form cuffs and weaving forms; and necklaces are built with pendants and varying textures of chains. There is a sturdy elegance to Charlotte Chesnais pieces – one that the designer hopes translates to timeless and wearable jewellery. “It’s always like this in my work – the balance between having a strong design but still very classic, and still very timeless,” she says. “It’s always playing with the limits of two opposites: making sure it’s something very desirable now but [that] you’ll still want to wear it in five years.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402162.jpg" alt="Charlotte Chesnais at MATCHESFASHION, Photographed" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p><strong>Why do I want it?</strong> Having worked with gold, silver and vermeil, as well as small diamonds in her fine jewellery collections, Chesnais’ latest offering sees her embrace a new element: pearls. “I met an amazing supplier who has been looking for pearls all over the world for generations, a family business,” she explains. “I was totally intrigued and now I’m hooked.” The collection launched last week exclusively on Matches Fashion, and sees pearls incorporated into some of Chesnais’ signature shapes and new designs. “I was thinking that if I lose the metal, I’m kind of losing the brand’s identity,” she says of how she brought pearls into the collection. “I wanted to let the pearl take its own space but at the same time continue exploring the DNA of the brand in the collection.”</p>
<p>The highly unique nature of the material was a point of fascination for Chesnais, who found herself drawn to working with baroque pearls. “I love those kinds of pearls because they are not perfect and they are all different,” she says. “I like the fact that everybody will have an individual piece of jewellery in a way because they’re all natural and different pearls.” From silvery baroque pearl pendants to rings set with perfectly round white pearls, the collection showcases both classic and unconventional pieces. “There’s two categories: half of the collection is done in vermeil, and half of the collection is done in gold. Everything that is in gold is one of a kind – for those pieces we used really big and strange and unique pearls,” says Chesnais.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">
        <img src="https://anotherimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/another-prod/400/2/402158.jpg" alt="1374212 Charlotte Chesnais sculpture, #163;1,990 exclu" />        <figcaption>

    </figure>
<p>With the pearls comes another first for the brand: Chesnais has designed a series of sculptures for the Matches Fashion collection. Small enough to place on a desk or table, the fluid forms – cast in bronze and produced at the same atelier which makes all of Charlotte Chesnais’ jewellery – mirror the shapes of the jewellery with sweeping lengths of metal. “They are pieces for the home, and this is a category I would love to explore more,” Chesnais explains. “I don’t know if it’s me getting older, but I’m more and more into beautiful objects. For me, jewellery is really the boundary between fashion accessory and object, and I really want to go more in that direction. I’m more interested in beautiful things done really well – especially now that people are stuck at home, it’s more important to have beautiful surroundings.”</p>
<p>The sculptures stem from some originally shown at the Festival d’Hyères in 2019, as “more like a one-of-a-kind project, a personal thing”. The original pieces were like Chesnais’ jewellery, but supersized; the pieces stood at almost a metre tall. “[Matches and I] worked together on a more reasonable size,” she laughs. It marks a natural expansion of the Charlotte Chesnais universe, which the designer hopes might extend to shoes, accessories, and objects for the home alongside future collections. For now, as her brand celebrates its five year anniversary, Chesnais is only looking forward. “I can’t believe it’s been five years already, I’m super super happy. We’re trying to move forward all the time, especially now in this tough moment – now that I’ve been here for five years, I know where I would like to be,” she says. “We are opening our first store in about a month and a half in Paris, which is super exciting. My personality is more like looking forwards than looking backwards – I still want to move forward and have fun in what I do.”</p>

<p><em>One of fashion’s most independent and visionary minds, Helmut Lang’s utilitarian designs came to define the 90s. This year, just as that decade becomes ripe for reappraisal and Lang’s contribution seems more relevant than ever, his archive burned down. Here, we present an exclusive selection of Lang’s work and Susannah Frankel enjoys a rare interview with the fashion designer turned artist</em></p>
<p>It is surely more than a little ironic that just as <strong>Helmut Lang</strong>’s signature is more heavily referenced than ever, and his original designs are among the most coveted the world over, the former fashion designer’s own archive has – quite literally – gone up in smoke.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s like in <em>Lost</em> – swallowed by the smoke monster,” Lang laughs, putting what might be described as an unusually brave face on it, although history is testimony to the fact that he is not one to dwell sentimentally on the past.</p>
<p>“The studio is in the same building where we originally had the store and the headquarters,” he says. These days, Lang is pursuing work as a fine artist which, to date, has included collaborations and group exhibitions with friends Louise Bourgeois (“I think of her every day”) and Jenny Holzer and, more recently, solo shows in New York, Hanover and Berlin. Back in the 1990s, however, Helmut Lang, located at 80 Greene Street, in the heart of Downtown New York, was the place to travel for some of the world’s most innovative and inspiring designs. Lang’s handwriting not only influenced what women – and indeed men – chose to wear on a daily basis; it was also continuously directional and, more unusual still, entirely heartfelt. The fusion of an openly emotional, determinedly human and profoundly idealistic viewpoint, with a rigour and modernity that was unrivalled, set him apart, now as then. Then there was the fetishistic, at times deliberately unsettling streak that ensured that there was nothing even remotely bourgeois about this aesthetic: the uneasy fabric combinations, fine jersey bound to the body by thick strips of elastic, flesh-baring gashes at elbows and shoulders, fluttering ribbon disrupting the otherwise clean lines of the clothes … It should come as no great surprise, given the current climate, that any Lang-inspired designers – and there are many – have cleaned up the latter in particular. The raw power that his fashion heritage also signifies is not so high on the agenda for the current generation, which is clearly interested in both his designs and method of presentation. Theirs is a more polished vision, if you will, as best befits these luxury fixated times.</p>
<p>With the 1990s ripe for reappraisal and labels like “minimalism” and “utilitarianism” gaining currency as buzzwords once more – albeit with the word “new” preceding them – a multimedia exhibition celebrating that era opens this month at the MMK Museum of Modern Art in Frankfurt. When we speak, Lang has just begun working with another old friend, Juergen Teller, on an installation for a room there that will include the designer’s sculpture, <em>Front Row</em>, part of a project commissioned by Dakis Joannou, which refers to the bright, white warehouse space at 17 Rue Commines in Paris where he showed for years. Photographers and artists Vanessa Beecroft, M/M, Corinne Day and Wolfgang Tillmans among others will also be featured.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Ask Helmut Lang why the period in question appears to be so appealing right now and he says: “Retrospectively, I guess it was about establishing a new visual language. None of us had enough money to produce the kind of images that were around at that time so it was like a support system to enable us to find a way to express ourselves. There were certain restrictions when we started out and we worked within those to create a new taste level. With less possibilities came newness.”</p>
<p>Lang’s determinedly lo-fi presentations, referred to as Scéance de Travaille – work in progress, in acknowledgement of this being a continuing exploration of a certain aesthetic as opposed to isolated, one-off events – were a case in point. At Rue Commines, Lang mixed women’s wear with men’s wear – this too was a first – and eschewed any elaborate backdrop or raised platform in favour of concrete pathways along which models stormed at ground level rather than striking theatrical poses. In a way this was as close to a vignette of real life existence as a fashion show had ever come – real life at its most beautiful admittedly. Said models only added to that effect. The big names of the day were all present and correct of course – Lang’s shows were always a high point on the Paris schedule – but he also cast his friends, different age groups, and varied body shapes.</p>
<p>“The runway?” he remembers. “It was less dramatic than for a Mugler or Montana show, for example. That was a stage and the clothes were made for a stage. Our fashion was not for the stage. It was for wearing. The same thing happened with the images from that time.”</p>
<p>Claims that Helmut Lang fell in love at first sight with the aforementioned Teller in a public convenience in Vienna in 1991 are unsubstantiated – or, “I made that up,” as the photographer now puts it. “We met at the beginning of the 90s in Paris at the shows and started working together in 1993,” Teller says. “We liked each other right from the start. I was really drawn to Helmut’s manner, to his way of being. We both spoke German which was unusual and, for me, it was really extraordinary that some guy from Vienna was making noise in Paris.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Any personal connection aside, Teller also saw Lang’s process as ideal subject matter for his own work. From that point forward he began shooting backstage at Helmut Lang each season – back then such access was unprecedented – going on to produce some of the designer’s most memorable advertising campaigns, pioneering, amongst other things, the use of images that were ready made.</p>
<p>“We were young and didn’t have any money or anything,” Teller remembers. “It was difficult for Venetia [Scott] and for Melanie Ward and for all those people in the early 90s to do the stories and get the clothes. Half of it was from Portobello Market and thrift shops. Only a few bits and pieces came from fashion designers. It was a completely different time. We just did things because we wanted to do them and because it was exciting.”</p>
<p>Teller also confirms that any appeal was rooted in Lang’s entire approach and not only the clothes. “Backstage at Helmut’s shows, there were suddenly all these supermodels, these fantastic looking girls and I was right there with the chance to photograph them,” he says. “I think Helmut was doing something modern, something new, something you hadn’t seen before. The whole package was very important. Where he showed it, how he showed it, the music, the casting … There was this buzz and excitement, the girls were nervous, maybe, Helmut was nervous. The way six months of work was over in ten minutes, that was brilliant too. It was a better way of capturing what he did than using the clothes for a shoot set up in a studio. It was much more real.”</p>
<p>In 2000, Anna Wintour commented on Helmut Lang’s impact thus: “Helmut came along and at first it was ‘Wait a moment, what’s this? This is not the spirit of the mid-80s’ – which was all about opulence. But then everything crashed and fashion reflected that and Helmut was there to take advantage.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is a bit too late to question the internet. It is here for better or worse and it magnifies the informative and visual chaos we are dealing with right now” – Helmut Lang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the excesses of the first decade of the new millennium and the crash that likewise followed, a renewed interest in Lang’s work is only to be expected, then. However, the fact that his designs appear just as relevant, just as contemporary, now as they did then is more remarkable. There is none of the telltale period detail that dates the work of lesser designers leading inevitably to the conclusion that Helmut Lang is that rare thing, a visionary, ahead of his time in almost every way. Even our all-consuming love affair with the internet was foreseen by Lang years before the rest of the world caught up with him. He made the decision to live stream his Autumn/Winter 1998 collection online only days before it was shown, having relocated his business from Vienna to New York a year prior to that, acting, as he says he mostly does, “on instinct”, and presumably without realising quite the power the then relatively new medium would soon wield over the fashion industry and way, way beyond that.</p>
<p>“It is a bit too late to question the internet,” Lang says more than ten years later. “It is here for better or worse and it magnifies the informative and visual chaos we are dealing with right now. But it also enables great opportunity for so many people who are not in an urban environment. As with all radical changes in society, it will be accompanied by a set of ugly transitional circumstances. Ultimately, the future will be a progressed landscape with intriguing possibilities and the reality is that some will gain and others will lose. There is definitely no way back so we will consequently embrace the outcome and contribute all the good, human qualities we can. We will have to choose whether to be wise and responsible – or foolish.”</p>
<p>For Spring/Summer 1999, bucking the system once more, Lang announced that he would be showing in New York a good six weeks in advance of the official schedule and before the Milan and Paris collections. It is a measure of his impact that more than a few other big name American designers followed suit resulting in the New York shows being moved permanently. They now kick off the international fashion caravan as opposed to closing it.</p>
<p>“I think Helmut changed rules that were so embedded they weren’t even recognised as rules,” states the creative director, curator and writer Neville Wakefield, who worked with Lang on his first solo art exhibition, Alles Gleich Schwer, literally translated as “all has equal weight”, in 2008. “His reshaping of silhouette and its relationship to modernism, utility, sex and sentience was one aspect of that but he also tore down the temple of its presentation. He shifted the calendar, introduced the idea of the internet to fashion presentation, the ready-made image to fashion advertising – most of the things we now take for granted were gestures that seemed virtually unthinkable at the time.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>Helmut Lang sits on the side of the fence that decrees imitation is the most sincere form of flattery. In fact, nothing much seems to rattle this apparently serenely contented figure who, it is well known, sold his company to the Prada Group in 2004 and then walked away from it. The Helmut Lang trademark was later acquired by Link Theory Holdings which owns it today.</p>
<p>While insisting that it is no longer his place to comment on the workings of the fashion industry, Lang will speak of the corporate nature of society in general. “In a way, what has happened in the recent past with vast expansion and globalisation, and greater access to luxury and creativity, is that the system has become much more vulnerable and has been eclipsed by the importance of economic data,” he says. “The equation now reads money is making taste rather than taste making money. The result is an environment where one doesn’t really know what is what, and where more also means less rarity.”</p>
<p>Looking back: “I am proud that I was responsible for a body of work that is still contemporary and influential. But it is also important that a new language is formulated because the times are clearly demanding it.” As Wakefield argues, “What I see in terms of referencing is more of a stylistic quotation of the more monastic uniform driven aspects of the Helmut Lang aesthetic than any attempt at the kind of paradigm shift that he instigated.”</p>
<p>“Even in fashion, it’s not all about silhouette,” Lang confirms. “It is also very much about the entire idea of reflection and there is an invincible borderline where fashion is not only fashion but becomes an evident expression of an era.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am proud that I was responsible for a body of work that is still contemporary and influential. But it is also important that a new language is formulated because the times are clearly demanding it” – Helmut Lang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even so, there is little more evidently expressive of its time than the aforementioned Helmut Lang archive. “It’s on the third floor,” Lang explains. “Our studio director got a call in the middle of the night on February 18th this year to say there was a problem, then 200 firemen turned up along with the media and the Red Cross.” He says this almost as if it were an everyday occurrence. Suggest that it is, in fact, nothing short of calamitous in a burning of the books/Kafka-esque kind of away and Lang says deadpan: “Don’t be too dramatic. I’m thinking you’re more dramatic than I am. Please get that out of your head.”</p>
<p>As luck would have it – or “sometimes it’s crazy how things work out”– Lang’s team had previously spent months going through 1,000s of pieces dating, for the most part, from the late 90s onwards, and donating them to museums around the world. “Prior to that period we didn’t ever really keep an archive,” he says. “I never wanted one and we needed the money so we sold the samples or paid models in clothes.” The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Costume Institute in Kyoto, the Musée de la Mode et du Textile in Paris, MoMu in Antwerp, LACMA in LosAngeles, the Groninger in the Netherlands and more all now have a (thankfully undamaged) selection of his designs from the latter part of his career at least for posterity.</p>
<p>Moreover – and this too is typical – Lang now views the transformation of his hitherto well-preserved legacy with not only pragmatism but even optimism. He intends, he explains, to use some if not all of it – there still remains between 7,000 and 8,000 pieces – as raw material for future projects just as he did, to name just one example, the letters and other documentation he kept over the years for his ongoing <em>Selective Memory Series</em>. Of this project, Lang has said that the abstract appearance of the notes when placed alongside one another was the point of the exercise over and above any focus on their content. Even so, it is hard for anyone with even a passing interest in fashion to resist reading notes written by everyone from Roman Polanski (“never mind the awards, I looked smashing, didn’t I?”) to Bruce Weber (“the clothes for dogs are so great that I can’t wait to see them wearing them”) and from Carine Roitfeld (“thank you for my handcuff … I’m yours forever”) to Donatella Versace, who addressed an invitation to “Helmut baby”.</p>
<p>“My history sometimes informs my current work,” explains Lang, “as it is part of my memories. I also used found objects in fashion. [Spray-painted vintage cowboy boots, antique embroideries, necklaces with their gemstones removed and bottle-top buttons all played their part.] Obviously, there’s a very emotional side to me but I definitely don’t think yesterday was better because that’s just pointless. Once in a while, of course, that’s fine but as a general concept I think we have to live in the present and the past is about experience with which to live a better life now. You know, there’s one shoe from the archive, for example, that’s completely burnt and it has become a different form because of that, but it actually still looks great. It seems to meas if that is an acknowledgement of the transformative power of the fire, that it’s about destruction but it still looks beautiful. I said some years ago that I work on something and do it as well as I can and then, when it’s finished, I hand it over to the public and they do what they want with it. The fire did the same with certain pieces and I find that pretty interesting.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“Helmut’s an aesthete who believes in the creative energy of destruction,” says Wakefield. “Whether in fashion or art he’s always working with the friction of opposing elements.” More specifically, perhaps: “I think the fire damage is a kind of collateral expression of his ambivalence towards his career in fashion. The archive represents Helmut’s cannon and I suspect he doesn’t want to be canonized. Like Ed Ruscha it maybe a question of ‘I don’t want no retrospective’. It may be that he’s more interested in burning his career than preserving it.”</p>
<p>Born in Vienna in 1956, Helmut Lang is known for dressing cities but this belies the fact that he spent most of the first ten years of his life in relative isolation in the village of Ramsau am Dachstein in the Austrian Alps.</p>
<p>“I caught up late,” he said when we first met in Paris way back when. “I was a late teenager. If you start out with less, you eventually have the possibility to experience more, you have a greater evolution in front of you than someone born into a wealthy environment. There was no TV. It’s not that I’m that ancient, you know. I didn’t read particularly. I guess that these days people are more impatient, children start reading when they’re six. If you grow up in the country you know how nature works, you understand the cycle of things. It was just about life which is the most important thing anyway.”</p>
<p>Lang lived with his maternal grandparents at that time, following the divorce of his parents – his mother subsequently died. “In the mountains, there was a very elegant way about basic necessities, a great beauty in a certain way that is completely refined but not about money,” he told John Seabrook in the <em>New Yorker</em> in 2000. “People who grow up in the city don’t have that sense of taste, they don’t experience it as connected to real life, to nature, as I did. I was really lucky to have that experience, though I was perhaps unlucky that my parents' divorce and my mother’s death made me have it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I think that I was always armed with my own vision and I’m prompted by the desire to find the true form for whatever I am working on” – Helmut Lang</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there is more than a touch of the fairytale to these beginnings, the dark side of that genre was soon at play once more. Lang’s father remarried, at which point he was taken to live with him and his new stepmother in Vienna and was forced to wear cast-offs from her dead father’s wardrobe. Given that the latter was a Viennese businessman this was highly structured and formal and so, one can only assume, young Helmut Lang cut quite a dash. “No. I was like Edward Scissorhands,” he says. “I just felt very odd. I didn’t want to leave the mountains. I would have preferred the world to be flat and high, that’s where I grew up, and not so round. I had a bad time in Vienna for a few years with my stepmother and father and I moved out when I was 18 and started out on my own.” He never spoke to his father, who died some years ago, or his stepmother again.</p>
<p>As is often the case for those deprived of the opportunity to express themselves stylistically in their formative years, out on his own Lang made the most of things describing his appearance thereafter as “overdressed, a major mistake – definitely completely wrong.” More than that, he will not be drawn. In 1977, however, he started creating his own, more pared down wardrobe in a made-to-measure studio in the Austrian capital and was soon making clothes for friends and acquaintances too. “I never chose fashion as a career,” he explains. “It started as an accident and I made it a career. I didn’t have much choice but I am thankful for that now. I have never separated work from life and I have never really known any other way.” Over the next 25 years this approach gave rise to one of the most respected fashion houses of the second half of the 20th century. By today’s standards, this was a highly considered – as opposed to meteoric – rise to fame, however, and one that was almost entirely uncompromised.</p>
<p>“I think that I was always armed with my own vision and I’m prompted by the desire to find the true form for whatever I am working on,” Lang says. “I don’t think compromising creativity has pushed anything forward – only independent work and independent minds have done so. I’m really not applying this to a designer in particular but to anyone who wants to do something creative. If someone does want to establish their own fashion house, though, and have the freedom to independently pursue their own personal vision, that comes with a set of consequences. It will take a long time and it won’t bring instant fame – definitely not money – for quite some years. Circumstances at the moment militate against the independent designer as it seems really hard to resist money. There is a high expectation for everything to be instant which, naturally, comes at a price. You cannot blame the establishment for that because revolution doesn’t start from the top. That much is clear.”</p>
<p>Much has been made of Helmut Lang’s decision to spend a good part of his time today at his Long Island home, far from the madding crowd, as it were. The designer turned artist has returned to the isolated environment of his early years, it is said. It’s safe to assume that this is a somewhat romanticised view, however. In reality, he is based as much in New York, where he also has his apartment and studio, as he is by the ocean and is surrounded by an intimate circle of friends and collaborators just as he always has been. Away from the endlessly sedentary world of the fashion designer’s studio he is now bronzed and buff and has even cut his trademark hair. “It was time. And it’s so much easier, life, without a blow-dry,” he laughs. “It changes everything.” But, for the most part it is business as usual.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>“Remember, for a long time I had my studio in Vienna which, really, compared to London, Paris, Milan and New York is not urban. I have always preferred to work in an environment where it is quiet and less distracted. Then I need the urban environment to present mywork, to exchange and animate it and have feedback and I really enjoy that.” Lang describes himself as “border-less”, clearly comfortable with his Austrian roots and the way that his time in Paris shaped him. “Obviously I settled here [in the US] and this is my home but I feel like I’m part of everything. I never understood, for example, when Austrians leave Austria not wishing to be there anymore, and then regroup in London, New York, or wherever, and do their own little Austrian thing … Do you know what I mean? Don’t leave.”</p>
<p>In his latter days as a designer, Lang eschewed the social shenanigans surrounding the fashion industry and famously declined to pick up no less than three CFDA awards in person. Today he takes this one step further, not even attending his own openings. “I never felt comfortable with public mass exposure,” he says, “but in fashion I had to be there and backstage. It was part of the process. With art, I don’t have to, so I take chances.”</p>
<p>It is genuinely heart-warming to find that the chances that Helmut Lang takes – and has indeed always taken – have paid off. If anyone deserves their moment in the sun – quite literally – it is he. It is almost unprecedented, after all, to emerge from today’s increasingly fierce system with integrity, a legacy, financial independence and a life beyond fashion and that is just what Lang has achieved. Not that there is any question of his ever resting on his laurels. For now he works as hard as he ever did, applying just the same approach to his art as he once did to fashion.</p>
<p>“I talk to him often,” says Teller, “visit him in Long Island, we’re really close, he’s a friend of the family. When we speak, we still struggle to make sense of the industry. When I see how people today have to work, how much commercial strain they’re under … My goodness me, I don’t know how they do it. I think Helmut was really clever. He made money out of fashion and now I think you absolutely feel his hand in his art. When you’re in front of it, you feel it very strongly.”</p>
<p>“Emotionally, it is the same approach, the same struggle to wrestle with an unknown beginning,” Helmut Lang says. “To apply pressure to oneself means to care about what one does. I always want to be my best and I never expect things to be easy along the way. In that sense, it doesn’t matter what I do.”</p>

<p><em>This article is published as part of a series of </em><a href="/designer-interviews"><em>Designer Interviews</em></a><em>, where we’re speaking to some of the industry’s most crucial voices about this current – and highly unique – moment in fashion history.</em></p><p><a href="/tag/dries-van-noten"><strong>Dries Van Noten</strong></a>’s <a href="/tag/springsummer-2021">Spring/Summer 2021</a> collection was developed during lockdown, in the early stages at least. The designer was working from his home in the countryside outside Antwerp and communicating with his team via Zoom.</p>
<p>“It was a new way of working and also a time for reflection,” he says when we speak, the morning before images of his latest offering are officially released. Van Noten is now back in the warehouse building that houses his business, located on the water front of the Belgian city, famed for its port, its cathedral and, of course, its fashion. “It was a time to think about what’s going to be important in the future; will there still even be fashion in the future? Talking with my creative team one thing became clear: the collection had to be rather simple, rather straightforward but not boring – fresh and optimistic. We wanted to find opportunity in limitation. We looked at a lot of things, we talked about light, about colour. We wanted it to be about individuality, not uniformity, about open-mindedness. And we talked about beauty but not about beauty in the past – about a very active beauty, about finding beauty in smaller things.”</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Van Noten next came across the oeuvre of the New Zealand-born filmmaker and artist, Len Lye, and was struck by its inventiveness. “When I first saw his films, I thought they could have been made in the 60s and 70s – psychedelia – but, in fact, it was in the 20s, 30s and 40s.” So piqued was the designer’s interest by Lye’s experimental movies – and later by his essays and his mobiles: he was among the earliest practitioners of kinetic sculpture or, as the artist himself put it, “the art of movement” – that Van Noten got in touch with the Len Lye Foundation and looked further. The result is a formal collaboration and a celebration of a pioneering figurehead of the post-war avant-garde and friend and associate of Man Ray, among others. “His body of work is so different,” Van Noten says, “so unknown. We found it super interesting that Lye painted directly onto film, painted, scratched, made little stencils – incredible. He is an artist who is fascinated by movement and movement for me is also important. I wanted to capture the essence of his work in dress. I love to see clothes moving, I love to see people moving in clothes which is why I love fashion shows. But those are not possible now.”</p>
<p>Himself a pioneer – of experiential fashion shows not least – Van Noten, whose presentations are increasingly among the most impactful on the Paris schedule, never contemplated showing to a live audience this time around. Instead, early on in the process he went “back to books, to the library which I hadn’t done for some time. It occurred to me then that the building blocks of fashion culture are visual, that, until really quite recently, fashion was primarily documented in pictures. If you think of Ray Petri and Buffalo, or Paul Poiret, it was all about image. We knew early on that we were not going to be able to do a live show and when we thought about communicating through image we immediately thought of <a href="/user/VivianeSassen">Viviane Sassen</a>. She is always on our mood board. Her work is so minimal in a way but also so suggestive.”</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>It is striking that the same thing might be said about Van Noten’s own output. And of his work this season for sure. If anyone is a master at fusing utilitarian dress with the elevated volumes and fabrication of haute couture it is Van Noten. “The intention was to simplify a lot of things,” he says. “To be quite direct. Instead of using all of our jacquards we worked mainly with cotton and organza and thought about making things that were stiff – or soft. With embroidery too we went in a different direction. We couldn’t travel to India this time which we would normally do.” Van Noten was among the first designers to use Indian embroiderers: when he originally applied the words Made in India to his fashion, his audience was perplexed, but now understands the exceptional craftsmanship that may imply. “We had to find a way to work with people there that was different too but tried to make it very positive,” he says.</p>
<p>If the total look of the collection is bold, bright and beautiful indeed and the embroidery is graphic as opposed to narrative, any apparent simplicity is deceptive. “There is the complexity of prints that continue right across garments, from skirts onto jackets, over the lapels, so that it really looks as if the image is projected onto the fabric, that it’s not just striped material in the first place.” The idea of projection harks back to the Len Lye archive – and all the prints in the collection spring from frames in his films – so too do entire texts sprawling across a plain white shift, say, in Lye’s own hand. Such monochromatic garments – and these include Van Noten’s signature tailoring worn now with natty Bermudas – are in direct contrast with saturated orange, pink, metallic gold and silver pieces, with rainbow waves, psychedelic sunbursts, exploding ruffles and solarised stills all as intensely dynamic as they are lovely.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p>For the first time from this designer, Spring/Summer 2021 is a ‘show’, per se, for men and women. Van Noten says, it was his instinct to do it that way, a reflection of a certain reality, of the times in which we live. “Normally I approach men’s and women’s from quite a different point of view but this time I wanted a single point of view, to design one big collection. In the end, who cares whether you are a man or a woman? But it was nice to have a dialogue between the men’s and the women’s right from the start.”</p>
<p>And it is through Viviane Sassen’s lens that Van Noten’s work is communicated. The designer – and long-time collaborators Nancy Rohde (styling), Sam McKnight (hair) and Inge Grognard (make-up) – travelled to Rotterdam where the photographer shot the clothes on the beach. To surmise: “With Viviane, as I said, on one side there is restriction, minimalism, on the other a lot of suggestion and that was exactly what I was looking for. For me it was an incredible experience. To see how clear she is, how fast sometimes. The collection really came alive that way. There is that freshness, that sense of life that is so vivid in her pictures. And I loved the idea of lightness, of white clouds moving across a clear blue sky.”</p>]]>

      <![CDATA[






<p><em>Afternoons</em> is a fitting title for New York-based artist <strong><a href="http://www.jennawestra.com/">Jenna Westra</a></strong>’s <a href="https://lubov.nyc/jenna-westra-afternoons">current exhibition</a> at Chinatown gallery, Lubov – and <a href="http://www.hasslabooks.com/HB068.html">a coinciding book</a>, published by Hassla. The exhibition’s seven photographs delicately articulate that sense of a midday lull, with a handful of models collectedly moving their bodies based on Westra’s instructions. Supervision, however, subtly prevails the moments’ otherwise poetic contortions. The figures are equally determined and elusive, engaging with one another in vaguely narrated juxtapositions with cues from Modernist dance. In <em>Dancers (Backbend)</em> (2020), a woman in a tan-coloured leotard leans backwards onto the other’s back, caught between repose and discomfort. <em>Feather Scene</em> (2020) shows a model also stretching backwards for an encounter with a feather held by another woman – a third subject witnesses the scene on the right bottom and completes a tableau reminiscent of a pietà.</p>
<p>Westra captures the bodies with ease, leaving room for cracks slipping through her instructions and blurring the line between chance and decision. Tension is handled with care and poise, such as <em>Untitled</em> (2017) in which a model’s neck rests on the other’s hand when both parties are self-assured. <em>Tights Pinch</em> (2015) freezes a moment of tangible pressure between a woman’s hand and her pulled sheer tights. <em>Park Picture (Les Fleurs)</em> (2020) is unique for being the exhibition’s only outdoor shot and including its sole male subject. A couple is entangled, their torsos pressed together. They seem to hide away from something or someone, covering their faces with one another both for protection and out of yearning. They’re not subject to Westra’s instructions, but the artist’s lens observes them from afar, freezing the otherwise fleeting moment.</p>
<p>AnOther talked to Westra about her interest in leaving movements to chance as much as choreographing them and how the quarantine era brought her back outside of her studio.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>“I don’t shoot too often, maybe once every couple of months, but in between shoots I think of ways I want to see bodies touch or interact - vignettes that hold some sort of tension. The instructions I present to the models can be really simple, such as a foot touching an arm, or a fruit prop held in an unexpected way, or a body leaning backwards onto another. I am also keenly aware that what is left out of the frame is just as important as what’s actually pictured, and use close cropping as a strategy to highlight this.</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m also open to letting things happen organically, which is even more of a possibility when working with dancers, or people who have an especially close connection with their physicality. In the current show, </em>Dancers (Backbend)<em> 2020 came from a moment where the models were trying things and moving around without any direction. I’ve come to appreciate and even try to pull out more of these chance moments, particularly in this show. The works in my last show with Lubov in 2018 all came from one five-hour shoot. I wanted to see what would happen if I gave myself a time and space limitation. In the current show, I have a couple of these very constructed studio images but also a picture taken in a public park as well as one work from 2015 and one from 2017. I’m becoming more interested in flattening a perceived hierarchy of image making techniques across time, and how this approach can be part of a larger conversation about the relationship between vernacular and constructed images, and the mechanics of photography itself. </em></p>
<p><em>“I have always used my studio as a set, which is quite small and has a darkroom in the basement. Recently, it hasn’t felt safe inviting people there, so I rented a professional studio for the first time but also went outside to shoot for the first time in years. I shot the couple embracing at Hunter’s Point Park in Long Island City. This is not the first time I’ve photographed a man – I have and I will again, but I choose men who have maybe a sort of sensitivity. In that moment, I was interested in tenderness and touch, something that touches and stays with you. This image is the start of a continuing investigation I plan to pursue, of finding images along with constructing them, again thinking of the perceived hierarchy there. </em></p>
<p><em>“Modernist aesthetic has been an important part of my development as a photographer. I have always been drawn to performance film stills of modern and post-modern choreographers, specifically of Pina Bausch and Yvonne Rainer. They prompt ideas about the way a camera can change a performance. When a camera is present instead of an audience, the way dancers orient themselves changes. I’m attracted to the body, space and performance of a specific moment, which is generally captured in Modern dance as well as films by 1970s feminist artists.”</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

    </figure>
<p><em>“I question if there is a different value in a found image as opposed to one that is constructed. I studied painting, so I initially figured out my relationship to photography through walking around with my camera. During the pandemic, I had the chance to go through old negatives from that period and decided to revisit that experience with a long lens. I recently read something Lisette Model said about the attraction of the snapshot. She talks about how it’s refreshing to see something which is done directly, without any intention of it being good or bad. I took it as permission to just do what I want, and it was such a freeing idea. I realised the couple’s image from the park fit within the show because I’m also including older works, and shuffling relationships between images and how they are made, either outdoors or in the studio, either directed or by chance between moments.</em></p>
<p><em>“There is a trust between myself and the models, who are not always dancers, to represent their bodies in a non-violent way, and by that I mean a way that doesn’t reinforce certain patriarchal ideals of the female form. I presented a film which showed some of my process in a 2018 exhibition from an urge to keep track of missed moments while bodies converge and interact in ways that I did not instruct them. Chance is also in the park scene, but in another mode of encounter between me and strangers in the distance.</em></p>
<p><em>“I would argue that chance is always present in photography, because you can never fully know what the camera is going to see or how things are going to look in the final image. Still, I am deeply interested in how the camera has the ability to capture and make slippery moments permanent. Social distancing has made me less specific with my instructions and open to negotiating. I trust my instincts better. </em>Arm in Shorts<em> (2020) was one of the last images we made at the end of a shoot. The model just made that gesture and it worked.”</em></p>

<p>A$AP Rocky, Iggy Pop and Tyler, The Creator have come together for <strong>Gucci</strong>’s new men’s tailoring campaign, shot in Los Angeles in February. Reimagining the stars as “housemates”, cult director Harmony Korine captures the musicians (plus two feathered friends: a blue hyacinth and Biggy Pop, Iggy Pop’s parrot) in various rooms of the Californian Modernist house.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>“Together the trio have fun, and while each is undoubtedly a separate, powerful personality, their shared love of panache creates common ground,” <a href="/tag/gucci">Gucci</a> says in a statement released alongside the campaign of the perhaps unlikely group. In the accompanying campaign film, A$AP Rocky, Iggy Pop and Tyler, The Creator are seen throughout the house to a soundtrack of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgGK4qBTwpw"><em>Supernature</em> by Cerrone</a>, dancing, eating and hanging out in a series of typically eclectic Gucci outfits: think leopard print suits, monogrammed knitwear, 1970s-style sunglasses, colourful accessories and plush outerwear. </p>
<p>“It was beautiful to see these three men together, seemingly different but very similar,” says <a href="/tag/alessandro-michele">Alessandro Michele</a>. “This is another chapter of this journey. With these campaigns, I am working on different ways of being elegant, and these three men embody this idea perfectly. I like to tell the story of elegance in completely arbitrary and unexpected ways. Perhaps elegance is something in the air that sometimes you are not even ready for. Male elegance can be unpredictable and strange.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="psyCXr9uqaQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psyCXr9uqaQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p><em>Creative Director: Alessandro Michele.
