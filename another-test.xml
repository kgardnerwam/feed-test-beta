<p>In 2013, <a href="/art-photography/12605/ilyes-griyeb-photography-sale-of-parisian-youth-adama-traore"><strong>Ilyes Griyeb</strong></a> – then an art director – started getting acquainted with Morocco. His father, who was born in Morocco but emigrated to France as a young man, bought a farm in Meknès and, after spending some time there, Griyeb began photographing his family and friends. “It was a very natural way of starting a new career,” he tells AnOther. “I came to realise that most of the people photographing Morocco were foreigners, [who were] exoticising the visual potential of the country rather than connecting with its society. That’s how the idea of doing a portrait series about youth began.”</p>
<p>By the following year, this project had evolved into the idea for a book (“I even had the cover design in mind back then,” Griyeb says). His subjects’ backstories had become more diverse, and a narrative thread had begun to emerge. “I don’t think of myself as a classic documentary photographer,” Griyeb continues. “I want to photograph the truth, but in a way that it becomes appealing rather than bleak. Whatever people want to give me, I accept.”</p>
<p>With a distinct style somewhere between realism, portrait and fashion photography, complete with a vibrant colour treatment, the 74 images that compose the book offer a telling glimpse into the lives of Morocco’s young people. Here, Ilyes explains the interlacing stories behind his snapshots.</p>    <section class="fl-slideshow">

<p><em>“My original idea was delving into a reflection of Morocco’s youth, but I soon realised it wasn’t a monolith. There are two types of young people in Meknès: one lives in the traditional way, working in agriculture, marrying early, taking life one day at a time; the other looks up to the American dream or, more accurately, the European dream. They’re all about appearance, social media, capitalist values. So I started documenting the way they coexist in a bit of a tightrope, and the underlying tension between them.</em></p>
<p><em>“This phenomenon is deeply connected with the history of Moroccan emigration, which started in the late 70s and early 80s. Growing up, these millennial Moroccan kids would see their émigré compatriots coming back for the summer holidays with their expensive cars, and they dreamed of doing – and having – the same things. Fast forward to today, they exist in this dissonant world in which they pretend to live in abundance – buying iPhones and motorbikes, often between several of them to be able to afford them – yet they are broke, mostly still living with their parents and working jobs they find humiliating, spending every dirham they earn in luxury brands.</em></p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><em>“This obviously creates an intergenerational conflict, but also a strained relationship with their peers who have chosen a different life and who, funnily enough, have a bigger buying power even though their dreams are way more modest. It might look like these are two completely opposite directions, but the truth is they are both a portrait of the same reality, in which cultural trends don’t align with the country’s economic condition.</em></p>
<p><em>“Most of the people I portray are people I know or friends of friends. I’m not into doing castings for my photos; I’d rather just meet people, get to know them and then spontaneously decide to take their picture. I’m not trying to uncover any hidden facts. Whatever people want to transmit to my camera, I take at face value. There’s an authenticity to that innocence; in a way it’s like sitting back and letting a society unravel. It also makes my work somewhat sociological, and deeply personal too. Because, through these portraits and a few scattered landscape pictures, I feel like I have gotten to know my own history better, from who I am and where I come from, to why my parents educated me the way they did.”</em></p>

    <category term="Design  Living" />
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[






<p>In his new film, <strong><em>Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds</em></strong>, Werner Herzog explores the raw beauty and cosmic power of meteorites. The science documentary, co-directed by Cambridge University geographer and seismologist Clive Oppenheimer, traces the fascinating ways in which fragments of rocks from outer space have made renowned impressions far beyond the edges of any individual crater.</p>
<p>On 7 November 1492, the first recorded meteorite crashed into earth in the form of a fiery space rock shooting through the sky. It punched a hole three feet deep into the soil of a wheat field near French town Ensisheim, with a young boy as its only witness, as history recalls. At the time, the remarkable force of the meteorite impressed Austrian military commander, King Maximilian, who came to the town to battle the French a week after its arrival. He <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1992Metic..27...28M">labelled it “a sign of divine favor”</a> – Herzog and Oppenheimer’s <em>Fireball</em> helps us understand why.</p>
<p>“Somebody asked me ‘what’s the interest in this, they’re just lifeless rocks these meteorites?’ But the thing is they’re anything but lifeless,” says Oppenheimer. “Some of them are stuffed full of organic molecules and might be the building blocks of life. And of course, from time to time they barrel into our planet and reset the biological clock as they did 65 million years ago with the asteroid’s impact. So I think what fascinates us about them is how interwoven the nature of these stones or shooting stars impact the human nature that surrounds them.”</p>
<p>While the examination of meteorites is a scientific matter, there is also a spiritual element to it. In the documentary we’re shown how they exert their energy upon the earth, not only through multiple interviews with many eclectic people who study the larger-than-life forces but through breathtaking footage of fire light meteorites dashing across the sky and lunging towards earth.</p>
<p>“There are so many films that have been made for TV documentaries on meteorites, as well as Hollywood movies like <em>Deep Impact</em>, and others that look at the doomsday scenario, but I think what Werner and I achieve is a gripping new form of science documentary which is about the human stories not just the science,” Oppenheimer explains. “It asks what is the significance of this crater for the aboriginal communities? What are the oral traditions that they’ve had about it for thousands of years? Why is there what is most likely a meteorite set in the centre of the Great Mosque of Mecca and why is this one of the holiest realms of Islam? Supposedly the stone was brought to Ibrahim by the angel Gabriel and it was given to set in the Kaaba.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="K4X9fQsiAOQ"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K4X9fQsiAOQ" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>In the film, we’re shown shaky footage of the Black Stone, a sacred rock in the city of Mecca that Muslims circle around during Hajj, an annual Islamic pilgrimage that is a mandatory religious duty for Muslims to carry out at least once in their lifetime. Scientists have never been allowed to study the Black Stone but it is believed by researchers to be a meteorite. “These are things that I don’t think everyone is aware of,” adds Herzog. “I don’t think many are aware that people have found sugars in meteorites or that you can pick them up and they smell like the inside of a vacuum cleaner. That smell is four and a half million years old. It’s how the universe smelt 4,500 million years ago.”</p>
<p>There’s a lot to digest in the hour and 37 minutes long journey narrated by Herzog’s famous voice-over. Herzog and Oppenheimer, who previously worked together on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoSmPkWmG4k"><em>Into the Inferno</em></a> in 2016, delve into the different impact craters around the world. From the Polo Plato in Antarctica, a vast expanse of blue ice with only a handful of people scattered out looking for meteorites, to beside the sea on Meer Island in Torres Strait between Queensland and New Guinea, where we’re shown locals performing a meteorites dance. As Oppenheimer explains, “The Meer islanders believe that the souls of the departed climb up a coconut palm and launch across the night sky, so when they see a shooting star it indicates that someone has died or will die soon and this is enacted with fire torches by night.”</p>
<p>For Herzog, it is the different forms and sizes that fascinate him the most. “I praise micro meteorites when they’re microscopically small, it’s incredible,” he says. “But then in large they are the most beautiful sculptures. I mean the film holds its breath and it stops as it shows one after the other, they’re so beautiful.”</p>
<p>In <em>Fireball</em>, meteorites are more than flaming rocks from outer space. They write history and birth traditions and that, Herzog suggests, is why they’re worshipped. The film, which is now streaming on Apple TV, is full of contrast – visually, narratively and cinematically – yet there are interconnecting themes throughout. “It’s very easy as a storyteller to immediately know if something is big,” says Herzog. “This movie is big.”</p>

      <![CDATA[






<p>There are two qualities, I think, that are important to mention straightaway about <strong>Lynne Tillman</strong>, in part because they are so disarming in a distinguished cultural critic, novelist and New York institution. The first is that Tillman is very funny, with a self-deprecating wit that she aptly calls “gallows humour”. She is also uncommonly inquisitive, especially by the standards of an interview subject, with a habit of turning your question back over to you.</p>
<p>We speak over the phone on the day of the US election, to discuss Tillman’s novel <a href="https://peninsulapress.co.uk/product/men-and-apparitions"><em>Men and Apparitions</em></a>. Published in the US in 2018, and brought out in the UK this month by Peninsula Press, it’s the first of her books to be published here since the early 2000s, and her first novel in 12 years. (Though she brought out several books and taught too, in the interim. “Was it 12 years?” she says. “Well believe me, I wasn’t idle.”) The author of 15 books in total, since the late 80s Tillman has been a prolific and original writer of both fiction and criticism. Her 2014 collection of essays <em>What Would Lynne Tillman Do, </em>2006 novel <em>American Genius: A Comedy</em>, and recent work for<em> Frieze</em> in particular have brought her work to the attention of new generations of readers.</p>
<p>Initially conceived as a story about living in a glut of images, <em>Men and Apparitions </em>centres around 38-year-old visual culture anthropologist Ezekiel ‘Zeke’ Hooper Stark as he interrogates his history, practice, and the breakdown of his marriage. “He’s self-conscious, and like many self-conscious people he doesn’t know himself,” says Tillman. “In America people are teenagers when they’re 38 still.” Interwoven with meditations, or mini-essays, on the meaning of photography and images, the novel is a deft consideration of intimacy, self and gender, in particular contemporary masculinity. Arguably ethnographic in parts itself, <em>Men and Apparitions </em>concludes with a field study, ‘Men in Quotes’, with answers lifted directly from a real survey that Tillman sent out to roughly 40 of her male acquaintances.</p><p><strong>Holly Connolly: When I spoke to your publisher he pointed out how much affection there is for you in the States. He said something that I loved, which was that one American bookseller had told him, “Everyone has a Lynne Tillman story.”</strong></p>
<p>Lynne Tillman: Everyone has a story? Well I’d like to hear them! You should ask him if he remembers any of the stories, I hope they’re salacious!</p>
<p><strong>HC: Part of the novel is set in London, and it’s a section that reads very authentically. You lived in London and Europe for a time, right?</strong></p>
<p>L: London is very important to me. I was there in my twenties for quite a while and it’s where I began to kind of take myself apart and put myself back together differently. Amsterdam also, I was going back and forth between the two and coming to terms with the fact that if I thought I could be this ‘great writer’ then I’d better get started. And I couldn’t do it in Europe, somehow, it was a language issue in part. I was hearing English spoken by the English, and it’s a very different language in a way. So I was really not getting it together in Europe, while so many other American writers found it to be the place that they could write, I found it to be the place I couldn’t write. I needed to come back and take very seriously what I had to do. So that’s what I did.</p>    <figure class="flatplan-gallery-item">

<p><strong>HC:</strong><strong> What did taking it seriously look like?</strong></p>
<p>LT: When I would have an idea to do something, I finished it. I didn’t just start something and let it fizzle away. I sat down, said, “I’m going to write this,” and I did it. The difference between wanting to be a writer and actually writing is a world apart, and the determination to do it, and then executing that, took everything I had in me. Part of me, psychologically, was so terrified, so insecure, and it’s odd, because at the same time I had this other idea that I could be a great writer. Talk about a contradictory psyche! But one of them was stronger than the other, so it won out; the idea that I had to write.</p>
<p><strong>HC:</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I thought a male protagonist was an interesting way of exploring how feminism has affected men; how it’s shaped them and how the male role fits around feminism too. There’s a kind of question mark hanging over a lot of Zeke’s identity.</strong></p>
<p>LT: As far as I knew, writers hadn’t really taken up this idea of the effect of the women’s movement on men. And I think it’s been enormous, and in a funny way it may have been more enormous in some ways than on women. The changes that you see, and I’m not saying across the board and that there aren’t some neanderthals walking around, but I was very interested in all my younger male friends, gay and straight, who had very different ideas and were struggling with how to make these changes, and how to deal with their sexuality. And I think that the movement against gender conformity is very, very important, and it comes out of what feminism and the women’s movement set up.</p>
<p><strong>HC: This might seem very specific to you, but it’s interesting to me from a UK perspective as feminism here has seen this very strange turn, with a very small but vocal minority of ‘feminists’ adopting a trans-exclusionary stance. Given that this hasn’t been the case in the US, I wanted to know if you had any thoughts on this, as an American who is engaging with the impact of feminism.</strong></p>
<p>LT: I think it was a friend of mine, Tom Keenan, who is a brilliant theorist, who said that people don’t want to give up. In order for somebody else’s rights to be furthered, in a way you have to give up your own position. And I understand their resistance, because I think they’re hanging on to something; it’s been very painful for many feminists, or for women who call themselves feminists, to be able to speak about their oppression as women. But I don’t agree with this position, because I’m not an essentialist, and I do think that what we call a woman is a constructed thing. People are afraid of change. But I think history is on the side of the trans community, because I think they’re part of a wave coming out of feminism that is challenging the meaning of the body, what the body stands for, and because you’re in this body how it’s supposed to act and what it’s supposed to look like. It’s this great challenge to the idea that the body is the foundation of everything.</p>
<p><strong>HC: </strong><strong>You’re as much a writer of cultural criticism as you are of fiction. In this case, did you feel the novel gave you the freedom to explore certain ideas and concepts that a medium like journalism might not allow for?</strong></p>
<p>LT: I think fiction is as true as any other form of art. I can use characters to be and do and show the consciousness of a period, and have them completely involved in the world outside them, and it affects them of course, both consciously and unconsciously. Writing a character gives me a chance to explore things that I think about, or don’t think about, or think that others think about. I don’t have to agree with everything, I’m creating something other than myself. I think fiction is incredibly important, because without it we can’t think our way through or past a present that may be awful.</p>
<p>The problem with journalism, sometimes, is that it wants to speak about groups of people, and the notion that there are individuals inside, who make up all of these groups, and they have differences from each other, gets lost. I mean I don’t want to speak of the<em> best</em> journalism, but I think that’s a problem in most journalism.</p>
