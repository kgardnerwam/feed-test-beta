            <b>Anitta</b>&amp;#x2019;s artistic talent is beyond impressive. She possesses the skills, style, and attitude it takes to become a superstar on the music scene. At 27,
            <b>&amp;#xA0;<a href="https://us.hola.com/tags/anitta/" title="Larissa de Macedo Machado" target="_blank">Larissa de Macedo Machado</a>&amp;#xA0;</b>
            &amp;#x2014; her birth name &amp;#x2014; has already released five records, each of them different from the other. All of these albums are original, a word she likes to use when defining herself. It is not surprising that she has established herself
            as the number one singer in Brazil and the queen of global pop only ten years into her career. In a candid interview with HOLA! USA, Anitta reflects on her humble beginnings in the neighborhoods of Rio de Janeiro and her rise to stardom as the Queen
            of Brazilian pop.</p>

          <p data-score="124">She has been her own agent since she was 21 years old. The singer was born in the humble favela of Honorio Gurgel. This did not stop Anitta. Her vision of scaling and taking over the musical landscape is not a coincidence. She has
            a perfectly planned marketing strategy which has single handedly been crucial to her success. Anitta has (only on IG) over 49 million followers, let alone millions of followers in fan clubs worldwide. Her social media reach has had an incredible
            impact on her global market presence. Everything she has accomplished has positioned her as the tenth most relevant artist on the planet.

                            be indoors, which made me think a lot. I realized that I have been in my house all this time, I have this house for a long time, and I had never slept more than a week in it. That helped me to realize how important my life is and to value some time
                            for myself. I took advantage of that time to study and be more with my dogs, mother, and family. It helped me rest, eat things that I can&amp;#x2019;t while on tour or traveling the world. Later, there was another moment when I released a song in
                            Italian, it was a great success in Italy, and I had to go there to take advantage of the success of the song. I didn&amp;#x2019;t stop working, and those two have been different moments that I have spent in this quarantine.</label>
