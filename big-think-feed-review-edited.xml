            <figcaption>'I am not a religious man,' the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein once said to a friend, 'but I cannot help seeing every problem from a religious point of view.'</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <hr/>
          <p>These problems that he claims to see from a religious point of view tend to be technical matters of logic and language. Wittgenstein trained as an engineer before he turned to philosophy, and he draws on mundane metaphors of gears, levers and
            machinery. Where you find the word 'transcendent' in Wittgenstein's writings, you'll likely find 'misunderstanding' or 'nonsense' nearby.</p>
          <p>When he does respond to philosophers who set their sights on higher mysteries, Wittgenstein can be stubbornly dismissive. Consider: 'The man who said one cannot step into the same river twice was wrong; one
            <em>can</em>
            step into the same river twice.' With such blunt statements, Wittgenstein seems less a religious thinker and more a stodgy literalist. But a close examination of this remark can show us not only what Wittgenstein means by a 'religious point of view'
            but also reveal Wittgenstein as a religious thinker of striking originality.</p>
          <p>'The man' who made the remark about rivers is Heraclitus, a philosopher at once pre-Socratic and postmodern, misquoted on New Age websites and quoted out of context by everyone, since all we have of his corpus are isolated fragments. What is it
            that Heraclitus thinks we can't do? Obviously I
            <em>can</em>
            do a little in-and-out-and-back-in-again shuffle with my foot at a riverbank. But is it
            <em>the same</em>
            river from moment to moment â€“ the water flowing over my foot spills toward the ocean while new waters join the river at its source â€“ and am I the same person?</p>
          <h2>H2. Set yourself up for success</h2>
          <p>One reading of Heraclitus has him conveying a mystical message. We use this one word,
            <em>river</em>, to talk about something that's in constant flux, and that might dispose us to think that things are more fixed than they are â€“ indeed, to think that there are stable
            <em>things</em>
            at all. Our noun-bound language can't capture the ceaseless flow of existence. Heraclitus is saying that language is an inadequate tool for the purpose of limning reality.</p>

          <h3>H3. Be optimistic</h3>
          <p>What Wittgenstein finds intriguing about so many of our philosophical pronouncements is that while they seem profoundly important, it's unclear what difference they make to anything. Imagine Heraclitus spending an afternoon down by the river (or
            the constantly changing flux of river-like moments, if you prefer) with his friend Parmenides, who says that change is impossible. They might have a heated argument about whether the so-called river is many or one, but afterwards they can both go for
            a swim, get a cool drink to refresh themselves, or slip into some waders for a bit of fly fishing. None of these activities is in the least bit altered by the metaphysical commitments of the disputants.</p>

            <blockquote><p><span>What Heraclitus and Parmenides disagree about, Wittgenstein wants us to see, isn't a fact about the river but the rules for talking about the river</span></p></blockquote>

          <p>Wittgenstein thinks that we can get clearer about such disputes by likening the things that people say to moves in a game. Just as every move in a game of chess alters the state of play, so does every conversational move alter the state of play in
            what he calls the language-game. The point of talking, like the point of moving a chess piece, is to
            <em>do</em>
            something. But a move only counts as
            <em>that</em>
            move in
            <em>that</em>
            game provided a certain amount of stage-setting. To make sense of a chess game, you need to be able to distinguish knights from bishops, know how the different pieces move, and so on. Placing pieces on the board at the start of the game isn't a
            sequence of moves. It's something we do to make the game possible in the first place.</p>

            <p>One way we get confused by language, Wittgenstein thinks, is that the rule-stating and place-setting activities happen in the same medium as the actual moves of the language-game â€“ that is, in words. 'The river is overflowing its banks' and 'The word
              <em>river</em>
              is a noun' are both grammatically sound English sentences, but only the former is a move in a language-game. The latter states a rule for using language: it's like saying 'The bishop moves diagonally', and it's no more a move in a language-game than
              a demonstration of how the bishop moves is a move in chess.</p>

            <p>But if we dismiss the remark about rivers as a naive blunder, we learn nothing from it. 'In a certain sense one cannot take too much care in handling philosophical mistakes, they contain so much truth,' Wittgenstein cautions. Heraclitus and
              Parmenides might not
              <em>do</em>
              anything different as a result of their metaphysical differences, but those differences bespeak profoundly different
              <em>attitudes</em>
              toward
              <em>everything</em>
              they do. That attitude might be deep or shallow, bold or timorous, grateful or crabbed, but it isn't true or false. Similarly, the rules of a game aren't right or wrong â€“ they're the measure by which we determine whether moves
              <em>within</em>
              the game are right or wrong â€“ but which games you think are worth playing, and how you relate to the rules as you play them, says a lot about you.</p>

          <p>What Heraclitus and Parmenides disagree about, Wittgenstein wants us to see, isn't a fact about the river but the rules for talking about the river. Heraclitus is recommending a new language-game: one in which the rule for using the word
            <em>river</em>
            prohibits us from saying that we stepped into the same one twice, just as the rules of our own language-game prohibit us from saying that the same
            <em>moment</em>
            occurred at two different times. There's nothing wrong with proposing alternative rules, provided you're clear that that's what you're doing. If you say: 'The king moves just like the queen,' you're either saying something false about our game of
            chess or you're proposing an alternative version of the game â€“ which might or might not turn out to be any good. The trouble with Heraclitus is that he imagines he's talking about rivers and not rules â€“ and, in that case, he's simply wrong. The
            mistake we so often make in philosophy, according to Wittgenstein, is that we think we're doing one thing when in fact we're doing another.</p>

          <h3></h3><br/>
          <p>What, then, inclines us â€“ and Heraclitus â€“ to regard this expression of an attitude as a metaphysical fact? Recall that Heraclitus wants to reform our language-games because he thinks they misrepresent the way things really are. But consider what
            you'd need to do in order to assess whether our language-games are more or less adequate to some ultimate reality. You'd need to compare two things: our language-game and the reality that it's meant to represent. In other words, you'd need to compare
            reality as we represent it to ourselves with reality free of all representation. But that makes no sense: how can you represent to yourself how things look free of all representation?</p>
          <p>The fact that we might even be tempted to suppose we can do that bespeaks a deeply human longing to step outside our own skins. We can feel trapped by our bodily, time-bound existence. There's a kind of religious impulse that seeks liberation from
            these limits: it seeks to transcend our finite selves and make contact with the infinite. Wittgenstein's religious impulse pushes us in the opposite direction: he doesn't try to satisfy our aspiration for transcendence but to wean us from that
            aspiration altogether. The liberation he offers isn't liberation
            <em>from</em>
            our bounded selves but
            <em>for</em>
            our bounded selves.</p>
