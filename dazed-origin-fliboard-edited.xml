<p>When a teenage <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> first sauntered onto our screens back in 2010, the singer was dressed in a grey cardi, a scoop-neck tee, and a skinny, wraparound scarf that looked like they were picked up from <a href="/river-island">River Island</a>, <a href="/allsaints">AllSaints</a>, and <a href="/camden">Camden</a> Market respectively. Last Friday, he came close to breaking the internet as the first man to appear solo on the front cover of<a href="/vogue"><em> Vogue</em></a> – marking the occasion in nothing less than a periwinkle saloon dress from <a href="/gucci">Gucci</a>’s <a href="/fashion/gallery/28337/0/gucci-aw20">AW20 collection</a>. </p>
<p>Lensed by <a href="/tyler-mitchell">Tyler Mitchell</a>, the cover was the culmination of a decade-long transition for Styles, which has seen him level up from popped-collar <a href="/Topman">Topman</a> fits to sparkling, custom <a href="/Alessandro-Michele">Alessandro Michele</a>. It’s been a conscientious image overhaul, articulated with sensitivity and whimsy by stylist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/harry_lambert/?hl=en">Harry Lambert</a>, which has edged Styles ever further from tween-friendly boyband member to swaggering, glam-rock sex symbol.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="/jennifer-lopez">J.Lo</a>’s <a href="/fashion/article/24359/1/jennifer-lopez-versace-dress-created-google-images">Google Image-birthing</a> <a href="/versace">Versace</a> dress or one of <a href="/fashion/article/49550/1/fashion-looks-kristen-stewart-needs-to-wear-princess-diana-spencer-pablo-larrain">Lady Di’s countless revenge looks</a>, Styles’ <em>Vogue</em> gown was an instant classic – with the musician’s appearance ricocheting through his behemoth social media <a href="https://twitter.com/ULTRALIGHTGUCCI/status/1327269250243956737">fanbase</a> and stirring up a similar furore to when he wore a pearl earring and multicoloured nail polish to the <a href="/fashion/article/44353/1/2019-met-ball-camp-lady-gaga-billy-porter-kylie-kendall-jenner-harry-styles">2019</a> <a href="/met-ball">Met Gala</a>. In the accompanying <em>Vogue </em><a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/harry-styles-cover-december-2020">piece</a>, written by Hamish Bowles, Styles is described by Michele as a “revolutionary” for his gender-defying fashion choices, which make him “the image of a new era”. Only, is he really? Is a handsome, rich, cis-gendered white man wearing an expensive dress on the front cover of a glossy fashion magazine really all that boundary-pushing?</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>“It’s not new or radical,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/f_hitchcock?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Fenella Hitchcock</a>, a lecturer at the <a href="/London-College-of-Fashion">London College of Fashion</a>. “It just reflects the shifts in conversations surrounding masculinity that have been happening for a while.” That’s not to say the cover is not important. If anything, it’s the logical apex of Styles’ feminine frills, <a href="/tiktok">TikTok</a>’s femboy culture, and fashion’s heady embrace of <a href="/non-binary">non-binary</a> aesthetics. </p>
<p>In recent years, menswear has overtaken womenswear when it comes to transgressive design, particularly in its rejection of exaggerated <a href="/gender-indentity">masculine identities</a>. Think boys in pussy-bows at <a href="/gucci">Gucci</a>, <a href="/Ludovic-de-Saint-Sernin">Ludovic de Saint Sernin</a>’s barely-there breastplates, and literally anything seen on the Loverboy runway. Not to mention the dissolution of gender-specific shows altogether. “It’s <em>Vogue</em> being quite slow to respond to a shift that’s already happened towards less rigid approaches to categorising fashion,” says Hitchcock. </p>
<p>That said, it is an unprecedented move for the magazine. While <em>Vogue </em>is unlikely to be anyone’s go-to for radical queer politics, this month’s cover is, on some level, a powerful depiction of gender nonconformism. Remember: this is the magazine that suggested <a href="/zayn-malik">Zayn Malik</a> and <a href="/gigi-hadid">Gigi Hadid</a> were ‘embracing <a href="/gender-fluidity">gender-fluidity</a>’ because they sometimes shared t-shirts just three years ago. And as much as androgyny is increasingly commonplace in more directional fashion circles, garments continue to be funnelled into menswear and womenswear not only on the high street, but even by luxury retailers who stock these more ‘daring’, high-end pieces.</p><blockquote>
<p>“It’s an issue in terms of who gets to have these transgressive moments. We have cis white men who are celebrated for doing the very things that queer people do in day-to-day life all the time” – Fenella Hitchcock</p>
</blockquote><p>The entire infrastructure of the fashion business is built on these binaries, which means that, in spite of what designers present on the runway, people still feel a resistance in displaying any kind of gender variance in real life. It creates a tension between different levels of representation and, as a result, “there’s a real hunger for these kinds of images”, as <em>Menswear Revolution</em> author <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mccauleybowstead/?hl=en">Jay McCauley Bowstead</a> puts it. A craving to see a dismantling of gender reflected within the mainstream. Not to mention that “it could feel really affirming” if you happen to be questioning the boundaries of your own gender, “especially if you aren’t from somewhere with a great deal of diversity”, according to the writer.</p>
<p>For McCauley Bowstead, though, it goes beyond this. He believes the <em>Vogue</em> cover leans into the queering of heterosexuality. That is, the ways in which people who are understood to be straight “incorporate elements of queer culture” into their lives. While we don’t know the specifics of Styles’ sexuality, and nor should we feel entitled to, it’s a topic which he is often pressed on by interviewers and something he skilfully skirts answering. Not because “he’s holding it back”, but because “who cares?”, as he previously told one <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/14/harry-styles-sexual-ambiguity-dating-normals-rocking-a-dress"><em>Guardian</em> journalist</a>. Regardless, Styles embodies the increasing number of men who choose to reject “heterosexist dogma about how we should live our lives”, and that includes how we present ourselves. The cover is significant, therefore, as a site of contesting these normative forms of masculinity.</p>
<p>Except, Styles is far from being the first to do so. Music and fashion have always been spaces to renegotiate aesthetic approaches to gender. There’s <a href="/david-bowie">David Bowie</a>, <a href="/prince">Prince</a>, <a href="/Lenny-Kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a>. Even <a href="/brad-pitt">Brad Pitt</a>’s 1999 <em>Rolling Stone</em> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-29359-64880_lg.jpg?w=417">cover</a>. More recently, there’s been <a href="/jaden-smith">Jaden Smith</a>, <a href="/young-thug">Young Thug</a>, <a href="/Bad-Bunny">Bad Bunny</a>, <a href="/asap-rocky">A$AP Rocky</a>, <a href="/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a>, and <a href="/yves-tumorr">Yves Tumor</a>, to name but a few. Perhaps we’ve forgotten that <a href="/pharrell-williams">Pharrell Williams</a> appeared on the <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/pharrell-new-masculinity-cover-interview">cover of <em>GQ</em></a> just last year in a dress? In wider pop culture, we’ve seen <a href="/billy-porter">Billy Porter</a> and <a href="/jonathan-van-ness">Jonathan Van Ness</a> walk countless red carpets in ‘womenswear’. Granted, the pair could probably do with a Harry Lambert fit session (let’s be real, who couldn’t?) but it is indicative of how we read these aesthetics differently on <a href="/poc">POC</a> or queer bodies than on publicly straight white men. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>“It’s an issue in terms of who gets to have these transgressive moments,” says Hitchcock. “We have cis white men who are celebrated for doing the very things that queer people do in day-to-day life all the time.” While images like these are perhaps shocking to the standard <em>Vogue</em> reader, for many, it doesn’t break down a binary so much as buttress it. It’s a frustration <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alokvmenon/?hl=en">Alok Vaid-Menon</a>, author of <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/611537/beyond-the-gender-binary-by-alok-vaid-menon-illustrated-by-ashley-lukashevsky/"><em>Beyond The Gender Binary</em></a>, eloquently expressed in an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CHj1ctNh2N9/">Instagram post</a> over the weekend – “trans femmes of colour started this and continue to face the backlash from it. Our aesthetics make it to the mainstream, but not our bodies… we aren’t palatable enough to whiteness and heteronormativity”. In the context of political representation, when ‘<a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/harry-styles-cover-december-2020">supernova</a>’ Styles graces <em>Vogue</em> in women’s clothing, it suggests we are placing more attention on certain facets of experience and identities above others. That we are again privileging whiteness, the cis male, and extolling them above anyone else.</p>
<p>“He’s handsome and rich so nobody has to panic,” <a href="https://www.adamkershaw.net/">Adam Kershaw</a>, producer of the <a href="https://www.primaverasound.com/en/radio/shows/queer-sounds"><em>Queer Sounds</em></a> podcast, jokes. “The mainstream just gets excited by these types of men doing something a bit queer.” As when female fans swoon over a rock star in eyeliner, there’s always a frisson of eroticism around transgressing boundaries, and Mitchell’s cover takes full advantage of this. Still, the way in which the image frames femininity, and desire, remains within fixed masculine confines. The blazer, Styles’ athletic physique, the tattoos. “There’s a defensive gesture to the posture,” says McCauley Bowstead. “It’s playing off masculine and feminine symbols in a way which feels reminiscent of classic menswear imagery.” It’s true, these shots do feel quite ‘Ray Petri’ from some 80s issue of <em>The Face</em>. For Hitchcock, the effect is “flattening” rather than radical: “Some people might think this is what queerness is all about – a man in a dress – when it’s so much more complex than that.”</p><blockquote>
<p>“Some people might think this is what queerness is all about – a man in a dress – when it’s so much more complex than that” – Jay McCauley Bowstead</p>
</blockquote><p>Yet, is this <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>’ fault? Far from it. Should he be framed as a flag-bearer for <a href="/gender-neutral">gender-neutral</a> fashion? Absolutely not. So while it’s interesting that <em>Vogue</em>’s first solo male cover star happened to wear a dress, “it’s not something that is immediately in need of our applause” Hitchcock says. Particularly at a time when marginalised identities are so often denied their roses within mainstream culture. Styles is simply playing into a long-standing tradition of privileged artists exercising their freedom from gender constraints, and while it can be fun to watch, there’s not much revolutionary about it.</p>]]>

<p><a href="/tag/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> and her brother/producer <a href="/finneas">Finneas</a> have explained how they made her 2019 single, “<a href="/music/article/46817/1/listen-to-billie-eilish-new-single-everything-i-wanted">everything i wanted</a>”, in the latest edition of the <em>Song Exploder</em> podcast.</p>
<p>The 2019 track marked the first new material since Eilish dropped her award-winning debut, <em>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</em>, a few months prior. Now, speaking a year on from its release, the musical siblings reveal the dream that inspired the song, and explain how it almost didn’t get finished.</p>
<p>“We were at the tail end of working on Billie’s debut album,” explains Finneas, “and we were having that sort of second-guessing moment where we thought, ‘Do we have every song for this album? Should we try writing one or two more?’”</p>
<p>Eilish then reveals that she’d had a dream the previous night in which she’d jumped off a building and died. “The whole dream was me watching how everything went after I died,” she continues. “I was looking at my life through my non-existence.”</p><div class="video-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-youtube" data-id="EgBJmlPo8Xw"><span class="preserve-aspect-ratio" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="442" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EgBJmlPo8Xw" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="786"></iframe></span></div><p>In the dream, newspaper headlines declared, ‘Problematic 16-year-old Billie Eilish has finally killed herself’, and Eilish’s best friend’s claimed they “never really liked her” and were “pretty glad that she died”.</p>
<p>“It was one of those dreams that was everything you’ve been thinking put into a horrible reality,” Eilish laughs. “I couldn’t think of anything else. It was the only thing that was on my mind. I was very caught up and distracted and distant the entire day, and I couldn’t stop feeling it and being scared.”</p>
<p>Eilish says she told Finneas about it and the pair “had to write about it”. As the podcast goes on, Finneas explains how he produced the instrumental to create something “a little atypical” and “unique”.</p><p>Opening up about her struggle with her mental health, which likely influenced the dream, Eilish says: “I was really depressed at the time and had been suicidal in the past, so it was weird telling Finneas about the dream I had because I was like, ‘I had this dream that I kind of got what I wanted, which is dying’. When I think about it now, it’s like, ‘Jesus Christ, that’s dark’, but to be honest with you, it was real.”</p>
<p>Finneas reveals that he found it “scary” to hear Eilish “articulate her depression in a way that was more obvious than I think she was making it on a day-to-day basis”. According to Eilish, it became a big family argument, in which her parents told her she shouldn’t be writing about the dream/her depression and suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>“Because of that,” continues Eilish, “we didn’t write the rest of it for probably half a year.” </p>
<p>You can listen to the full podcast above, and hear Eilish’s new track, “Therefore I Am”, <a href="/music/article/51081/1/billie-eilish-explores-an-empty-mall-in-the-video-for-therefore-i-am">here</a>.</p>]]>

<p>An ode to the great romances of Hollywood, starring <a href="/tag/zendaya">Zendaya</a> and John Washington, is coming to <a href="/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> in 2021. <em>Malcolm and Marie</em>, from the <a href="/tag/euphoria"><em>Euphoria</em></a> creator Sam Levinson, follows a filmmaker, (Washington), and his girlfriend, (Zendaya), on their way home from a film premiere as they discuss former lovers and past relationships. </p>
<p>Netflix is planning an Academy Awards campaign for the black and white film after the streaming service acquired it for $30 million (£22 million) following the <a href="/tag/toronto-international-film-festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a> in September. </p>
<p>Rapper <a href="/tag/kid-cudi" data-stringify-link="https://www.dazeddigital.com/tag/kid-cudi" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Kid Cudi</a> and Yariv Milchan join as executive producers, while Levinson acts as writer and director. Levinson previously worked with Zendaya on the influential teen drama, <i data-stringify-type="italic">Euphoria, which earned the latter an Emmy for best lead actress this year. </i></p>
<p>Levinson said at the time of Netflix’s acquisition of <em>Malcolm and Marie</em>: “I am so grateful to this cast and crew, many of whom are my <em>Euphoria</em> family, for coming together during such uncertain times. We felt privileged to be able to make this film together and we did so with a lot of love. We are all thrilled that it has ended up with Netflix which is unparalleled in allowing filmmakers the freedom to tell their stories that reach audiences all over the world.”</p>
<p><em>Malcolm and Marie</em> is due to premiere February 5 on Netflix.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<h1 class="fl-title">Parris Goebel is so much more than just a choreographer</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The creative who has worked with Rihanna on Savage x Fenty, Dior, and Justin Bieber, is still passionate for more</h3>

<figure>
  <img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1290/9/1299186.jpg" alt="parris goebel Rihanna savage Fenty dance choreographer" />		<figcaption>
  <span class="fl-credit">@parrisgoebel</span>		</figcaption>

</figure>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/parrisgoebel/?hl=en">Parris Goebel</a> doesn’t want to be called a choreographer. “I get quite sensitive when people put me in a box,” she explains. “I’m so much more than just a dancer or a choreographer… I am an artist. I am a free spirit. I am a creative. I am a muse. I didn’t choose this life, I was born this way.”</p>
<p>If you’re feeling somewhat inspired or empowered by Goebel right now, well, that’s the point. Having dropped out of school at 15, getting booked to choreograph <a href="/tag/jennifer-lopez">J.Lo</a>’s world tour at 19, and working with the likes of <a href="/beauty/tag/dior">Dior</a> and <a href="/beauty/tag/justin-bieber">Justin Bieber</a>, now, at 29-years-old, the New Zealand native has just finished her most recent gig with <a href="/beauty/tag/rihanna">Rihanna</a> (a little show called <a href="/beauty/tag/savage-x-fenty">Savage x Fenty</a> vol. 2, don’t know if you’ve heard of it). </p>
<p>But, despite having achieved such notable success at such an early age, there is still an insatiable passion that drives Goebel, an energy which oozes out when she speaks. “If I didn’t create or express my soul in the way I do every day, my soul would probably die,” she says. “I feel like I’m living my purpose.”</p>
<p>Growing up in Auckland, and taking inspiration from the likes of <a href="/beauty/tag/missy-elliott">Missy Elliott</a> and <a href="/beauty/tag/prince">Prince</a>, Goebel taught herself how to dance by “obsessing over and mimicking music videos”. Now, she is creating dances which are aimed to make people feel good, uniting us all through a “universal language of love and joy.” </p>
<p>Here, we talk with the renowned creative about appreciating your own beauty, breaking down false narratives, and what it’s like working with Rihanna.  </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

</div>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about yourself and where you grew up? How has your background shaped who you are as a person?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel:</strong> I was born and raised in Auckland, New Zealand. I’m a proud Samoan woman and my family is my everything. I knew at a young age that I wanted to perform and create. I’ve always been a free spirit with big dreams. I dropped out of school at 15, and through the power of the internet, I was booked by J.Lo to choreograph her world tour at 19-years-old. From there, the doors started to open and I kept pursuing my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember the first time you were conscious of your appearance?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I was insecure about my looks all through my childhood, especially throughout my high school years. I was the only brown girl at my school and was bullied for having different features. I generally always felt like an outcast and it took me years to love myself. I’ve come such a long way with unpacking those insecurities and appreciating the beautiful woman I have grown to be. </p>
<p><strong>Growing up, what TV shows, models, artists, magazines, designers etc informed your understanding of beauty and identity and the way you presented yourself visually?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I loved Missy Elliott growing up. I was obsessed with her music, her visuals, and was in awe of her overall style. She went against the grain in everything she did and I felt that was the first time I deeply resonated with an artist. She showed me that you didn’t have to conform or fit the status quo to be successful. She shifted my whole perspective and gave me the confidence to be unapologetically me. I also loved Prince, he’s one of my favourite artists of all time. He was special and bold in his art. He used every outlet to express himself from music to fashion to art, and that’s what I try to do in my craft. I’m constantly finding new ways to express my soul and I want other people to feel that.</p>

  <p>“I’m constantly finding new ways to express my soul and I want other people to feel that” – Parris Goebel</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Why are you a dancer and choreographer? What made you want to become one? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I’m so much more than just a dancer or choreographer, and I get quite sensitive when people put me into a box. I am an artist. I am a free spirit. I am a creative. I am a muse. I didn’t choose this life, I was born this way. If I didn’t create or express my soul in the way I do every day, my soul would probably die. I’m extremely grateful to be able to do what I do and I feel like I’m living my purpose. </p>
<p><strong>How did you actually get into it? Where did you hone your craft? Is it something you learnt or is it more instinctual?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I didn’t have many resources in New Zealand so I would obsess over music videos and try and mimic them. Then movies like<em> Save The Last Dance</em> and <em>You Got Served</em> came out and changed my life. I just knew that I was going to be a part of that world one day. I didn’t really have a mentor, I mostly taught myself by watching videos and dancing in my room every day. When you’re born with a gift, it’s your destiny and there will always be a feeling that pulls you towards sharing it with other people.</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell us a bit about your creative process from the initial idea to final performance?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>It really depends on the project, but most of the time as soon as I hear the music, I’m able to see things. It could be movement, colours, or a story playing out in my mind. When it comes to choreography, I just push play and let my body freely move. It’s always a spontaneous and magical experience. I then build off of my base idea and add dancers to the overall vision. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>Is beauty something you try to capture in your work or something that you reject? What is your relationship to ‘beauty’ (whatever that word means to you)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>There is beauty in everything and everyone. </p>
<p><strong>How do you feel when you are dancing? Can you describe the emotions and sensations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>Immortal. Free. On fire. Floating. Falling. Electric. </p>
<p><strong>You’ve worked on so many iconic performances, videos, shows etc. What are the projects that you’re most proud of? Or that stand out to you the most. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I would have to say Rihanna’s Savage x Fenty shows have been the highlight of my career. I truly feel like the shows have inspired people all over the world to not only be themselves but to love themselves. That’s what matters most to me – if I can help set others free of judgement, insecurities and the pressures of the world... then I’m doing my job. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

</div>
<p><strong>How did you first become involved with Savage x Fenty?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I have been working closely with Rihanna for about five years now. She’s my sis, we always link up to create some magic. This is my third Savage x Fenty show, and I feel like every show has been so powerful.  </p>
<p><strong>The Savage x Fenty shows are such a celebration of diversity, bodies, beauty of every kind. What does it mean to you to work with a brand that prioritises diversity in the way Fenty does? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>It’s needed and it’s about time! For too long the world has been programmed to think beauty looks a certain way and that has left too many of us feeling unworthy and insecure. The more we can show real representation and diversity on influential platforms, the more we can break down false narratives and stereotypes.</p>
<p><strong>The Savage x Fenty vol 2 show really felt like a moment of much-needed joy at a time when things are looking quite bleak for many people. What was your aim going into the show this season? Were you factoring in the context that you were creating in?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>We wanted to bring people inspiration and joy. It has been a tough year for all of us and it was so important that the show uplifted the world and gave everyone that extra push to keep being happy and keep shining. That’s what I love about dance, it’s a universal language of love and joy. I’m so happy we could give everyone something to look forward to.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“That’s what I love about dance, it’s a universal language of love and joy. I’m so happy we could give everyone something to look forward to” – Parris Goebel</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The fashion and beauty industries still have a long way to go with inclusivity. What steps need to be made? How can the industries do better? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I believe it starts at the top. Having a diverse board that cares about culture and change. Too many times I have worked with brands or teams that just don’t get it. We need more understanding leaders that are passionate about showcasing different kinds of people in our world.</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to young dancers hoping to get into the industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>Be the hardest worker in the room. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>What are you currently working on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>I’m about to release my own clothing line, RUNAWAY MOTEL, which I’m super excited about. I’m also currently working on my debut feature film with Sony, and just about to start rehearsals for the AMA’s!</p>
<p><strong>How do you think our understanding of beauty has shifted with the evolution of technology?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parris Goebel: </strong>It depends on how you use technology. For example, you can use Instagram to showcase your beauty or you can use it to chase beauty. The world of social media has created an impossible idea of perfection, but I think once you understand that life isn’t about being perfect, it’s about being YOU, then you stop looking for validation and start expressing yourself instead. </p>

<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Teachers and parents had expected The Homophobic, Biphobic and Transphobic Challenge Fund to be extended</h3>

<p>The UK government has ended funding for projects in schools intended to stem the bullying of <a href="/tag/lgbt">LGBTQ+</a> pupils. Ministers are aware that LGBTQ+ pupils are at higher risk of abuse, however they claim that funding for the initiatives was always set to end, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/education-54988187?__twitter_impression=true">according</a> to the <em>BBC</em>.</p>
<p>Since May 2014, the government Equalities Office has launched several programmes targeting homophobic and transphobic bullying, costing up to £4m. The Homophobic, Biphobic and Transphobic Challenge Fund offered teachers and children training and workshops to help protect children. Providers of these workshops, as well as parents and teachers, expected the funding to continue, but the government “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/education-54988187?__twitter_impression=true">quietly</a>” pulled its backing of LGBTQ+ initiatives last March.</p>
<p>A workshop provider, who wished to remain anonymous, said that she felt “sick” at the news of funding being pulled and that her organisation had been “ignored” and “shut out”. She said: “What message does this send to young people? This government is rolling back on their initial commitment to LGBT rights”.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
<div class="content-tweet">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excuse me what the fuck?? You’re telling me the same day it’s announced the military will receive an extra £16.5 billion over the next 4 years, it’s revealed funding to tackle anti-LGBTQ bullying in schools has been axed?? I hate this country <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BorisJohnsonMustGo?src=hashamp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BorisJohnsonMustGo</a> <a href="https://t.co/AsvX4tf9t8">pic.twitter.com/AsvX4tf9t8</a></p>mdash; allyourdiamondsandgold (@but_i_see_you) <a href="https://twitter.com/but_i_see_you/status/1329340967745429504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p>The government Equalities Office told Dazed: “The anti-bullying grant fund, which provided 2250 schools across the country with materials and training, was always due to end in March 2020.” It added that The Department for Education will be taking forward “all anti-bullying work”, but said nothing of an extension to work relating specifically to LGBTQ+ pupils.</p>
<p>It added that the aim of The Homophobic, Biphobic and Transphobic Challenge Fund was to “educate” and “prevent” the bullying of LGBTQ+ students in schools. “Grantees had to demonstrate that they were able to do this. We are currently evaluating this programme to increase our evidence base on what works in schools, and, in June, the Department for Education announced it has extended its anti-bullying programme until March next year”.</p>
<p>When asked if there were plans for further LGBTQ+ specific funding, the government Equalities Office told Dazed: “The responsibility for all anti-bullying work now sits with the Department for Education now so will be up to them”.</p>]]>

<h2><strong>WHY SHOULD I CARE? </strong></h2>
<p>I first discovered ANTI-Collective products during <a href="/nyfw">NYFW</a> on a show I was doing. I later realised that it was an <a href="/lgbt">LGBTQ+</a> brand and that most of the people behind it are queer. </p>
<p>What first interested me was the super sexy design of the product and the smell. I have used lots of the brand’s products but this one really blows my mind with its results. It’s a leave-in conditioner, but I use it as more of a spray to add moisture and it works on any kind of hair. It also helps to detangle damp hair or to soften dry hair. </p>
<p>I usually spray it on damp hair (no more than six pumps) and then comb it through before starting my cut or blow dry. It helps to style as you wish and you can use it as an extra daytime conditioner, spray it on just before you leave the house! </p>
<p>What I love most about the spray is that it’s effective, but it’s not too heavy. You almost can’t feel it, it’s so lightweight, but it penetrates right down to the cuticle. That means it also works as a heat protector, so it’s everything you could want or need from a leave-in. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“What I love most about the spray is that it’s effective, but it’s not too heavy. You almost can’t feel it, it’s so lightweight, but it penetrates right down to the cuticle”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The composition is mainly natural and it’s sulfate-free (perfect for Brazilian blow dry) as well as gluten- and cruelty free. It also includes some of my favourite ingredients: </p>
<p>Avocado Oil – Rich in amino acid and vitamins A, D, and E. It penetrates deeply to condition, repair, and strengthen the hair shaft.</p>
<p>Coconut Fruit Extract – Intensely moisturising and conditioning and prevents hair from becoming brittle while also reducing scalp irritations.</p>
<p>Baobab Seed Extract – A multi-functional protein that repairs hair damage, increases hair strength, and protects hair from UV and heat damage.</p>
<p>Sunflower Seed Extract – Naturally rich in reparative antioxidants that protect hair against UV rays and environmental degradation.  </p>
<p>Moringa Leaf Extract – Extremely rich in proteins, vitamins, and minerals. This protein repairs damage and fortifies hair, improving hair strength and vibrancy. It also offers anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antifungal benefits.</p>
<p>Just like it says, this product is for everything and everyone. It can be used as a hair refresher to minimise bedhead or to reactivate existing hair products every morning. <em>Everything! </em></p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<h2><strong>QUICKFIRE QUESTIONS </strong></h2>
<p><strong>It feels like…</strong> a sex toy! Well, the bottle does at least…. </p>
<p><strong>Who would use it...</strong><strong> </strong>Farrah Fawcett obviously, how do you think she got that fabulously buoyant hair? </p>
<p><strong>If this product was one of the astrological signs it would be… </strong>a Leo because it’ll transform your hair into a fabulous mane like a lion. </p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>All of the artists featured on the soundtrack will appear under fictional identities that place them in the dystopian, near-future world of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, with their music being piped in via in-game radio stations. SOPHIE and Shygirl, for example, will become the duo Clockwork Venus, whose track is titled “BM”. Run the Jewels will become Yankee and the Brave. </p>
<p>As previously revealed, Grimes will take on the character of Lizzy Wizzy, a cyborg pop star whose whole body was replaced with cybernetics after she died onstage (get a closer look at the character and her backstory <a href="/science-tech/article/50435/1/closer-look-at-grimes-as-video-game-character-lizzy-wizzy-in-cyberpunk-2077">here</a>). Her new track is titled “Delicate Weapon”. Voiced by Grimes, Lizzy Wizzy will also appear in the game itself, alongside <a href="/science-tech/article/44796/1/keanu-reeves-video-game-character-in-cyberpunk-2077">a character played by</a> <a href="/keanu-reeves">Keanu Reeves</a>.</p>
<p>In December 2019, Grimes <a href="/music/article/47183/1/grimes-4aem-new-track-cyberpunk-2077">debuted another song</a> from the upcoming game’s soundtrack at the Game Awards in Los Angeles. Titled “4ÆM”, the track featured on her subsequently-released fifth album, <a href="/music/article/48063/1/new-music-friday-albums-to-hear-this-week"><em>Miss Anthropocene</em></a><em>.</em></p>

<p>Earlier this month, it was revealed that <a href="/the-matrix"><em>Matrix </em></a>directors <a href="/lana-wachowski">Lana</a> and <a href="/Lilly-wachowski">Lilly Wachowski</a> <a href="/film-tv/article/51107/1/matrix-4-wrap-party-was-disguised-as-a-film-shoot-to-bypass-covid-rules">faked a film shoot</a> in order to bypass <a href="/coronavirus">COVID-19</a> rules and hold a <em>Matrix 4 </em>wrap party for 200 members of cast and crew, including <a href="/keanu-reeves">Keanu Reeves</a>. However, they’re not the only ones that have misled authorities to throw a party in the time of coronavirus; two Australian schoolboys have recently gone as far as getting “married” to get around restrictions on their own event.</p>
<p>The pair of “best friends” – the relationship is purely platonic, it turns out – were attempting to throw an afterparty for their end of year prom. Admittedly, that sounds slightly less glamorous than the Wachowskis’ gathering, but it wasn’t much smaller, with a planned 150 attendees.</p>
<p>By holding a “wedding” before the event, the students were legally allowed to have that many people attend, so long as they obtained official permission and adhered to social distancing guidelines. Without a wedding ceremony, the gathering would be subjected to normal COVID-19 restrictions, capping attendance at 30 people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the private schoolboys (or fortunately, if you factor in the risk of catching the virus) one of their parents spotted images of the fake wedding on social media, cottoned onto what was going on, and rushed home from a holiday to stop the party before it even got started.</p>
<p>“Clearly, this was a silly teenage idea,” the dad <a href="https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/private-school-boys-plan-wedding-in-bid-to-throw-formal-afterparty/news-story/9ba8cd4f577f8415bc063fd4b2a5a94c">tells</a> the Australian <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, clarifying that: “no legally binding ceremony took place.”</p>
<p>“Furthermore, we immediately engaged a security firm to ensure that if anyone tried to attend, they would be turned away,” he says, “and no-one did actually turn up.”</p>
<p>The US – and Los Angeles in particular – has also seen a spate of illegal parties and gatherings since the global spread of COVID-19, with influencers seemingly flaunting public health orders <a href="/life-culture/article/49969/1/la-influencers-are-throwing-huge-parties-coronavirus-jake-paul-james-charles">left</a>, <a href="/life-culture/article/50189/1/la-influencer-throws-party-with-100-guests-has-power-shut-off-by-the-city">right</a>, and <a href="/life-culture/article/50428/1/influencers-under-fire-for-hosting-huge-party-at-illinois-state-university">centre</a>. In September, Billie Eilish even publicly <a href="/music/article/50479/1/billie-eilish-calls-out-people-partying-during-coronavirus-pandemic">called out</a> people partying during the pandemic, a criticism echoed by Ariana Grande <a href="/life-culture/article/50961/1/ariana-grande-is-tired-of-la-influencers-partying-during-covid">earlier this month</a>.</p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time In Hollywood novel is coming in 2021</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The director has signed a two book deal, with a non-fiction book also on the way</h3>

  <span class="fl-credit">via IMDb</span>		</figcaption>

</figure>
<p>Back in April, <a href="/quentin-tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a> said he was “<a href="/film-tv/article/48636/1/quentin-tarantino-is-considering-a-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-novel">thinking a lot</a>” about writing a novel based on his Oscar-nominated film, <a href="/tag/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood"><em>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</em></a><em>. </em>Now, that novel has been confirmed for a 2021 release, alongside a non-fiction book from the director.</p>
<p>The books will be published by HarperCollins, <em>Deadline </em><a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/quentin-tarantino-two-book-deal-harpercollins-novel-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-cinema-speculation-70s-movie-deep-dive-1234616927/">reports</a>, as part of a two book deal. The novel – which is set to arrive in June – will follow and expand upon the storyline of the 2019 film, which saw <a href="/Leonardo-dicaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a> and <a href="/brad-pitt">Brad Pitt</a> play a fading actor and his stunt double, who end up crossing paths with the Manson family.</p>
<p>In a statement on the book, Tarantino declares himself “a movie-novelisation aficionado”, adding: “I’m proud to announce <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> as my contribution to this often marginalised, yet beloved sub-genre in literature.” </p>
<p>“I’m also thrilled to further explore my characters and their world in a literary endeavour that can (hopefully) sit alongside its cinematic counterpart.”</p>
<p>“Quentin Tarantino’s literary talents have been in plain sight since his first scripts,” HarperCollins vice president and executive editor, Noah Eaker, tells <em>Deadline</em>. “But to see how skillfully he endows his characters with life on the page and how he constantly takes a reader by surprise, even one who knows the movie by heart, is to see a master storyteller trying on a new form and making it his own.”</p>
<p>The non-fiction book is titled <em>Cinema Speculation</em>. Reportedly, it will provide: “a deep dive into the movies of the 1970s, a rich mix of essays, reviews, personal writing, and tantalizing ‘what if’s’, from one of cinema’s most celebrated film-makers, and its most devoted fan.”</p>
<p>Tarantino is <a href="/film-tv/article/47556/1/quentin-tarantino-directing-a-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-bounty-law">also set to direct</a> a <em>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood </em>spin-off based on <em>Bounty Law</em>, the fictitious TV show that stars DiCaprio’s character in the film. In 2019, meanwhile, <a href="/film-tv/article/46272/1/quentin-tarantino-is-writing-a-novel-world-war-ii-veteran-hollywood-story">he hinted</a> that he was writing yet another book, which would revolve around a World War II veteran and his struggle to reconnect with Hollywood movies.</p>]]>

<p>From <a href="/beauty/tag/lil-nas-x">Lil Nas X</a> to <a href="/beauty/witch-week/article/46627/1/euphoria-alexa-demie-maddy-perez-witch-magick-goth-shoot-interview">Alexa Demie</a>, <a href="/beauty/barbie-ferreira">Barbie Ferreira</a>, and <a href="/beauty/tag/sza">SZA</a>, celebrity make-up artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/raoulalejandre/?hl=en">Raoul Alejandre</a> has continued to bring his touch of OTT 90s glamour to many of the most sought after faces in the beauty world today. </p>
<p>Having <a href="https://www.raoulalejandrebeauty.com/">worked across</a> editorials, fashion campaigns, and red carpets, it comes as no real surprise that the current <a href="/beauty/tag/coronavirus">COVID-19</a> pandemic, which has prohibited people from social interacting, and, in some cases, leaving their homes, has forced Alejandre to think of new and creative ways to exercise his artistic flair. </p>
<p>Working throughout quarantine, the Los Angeles native wanted to bring together his creative community in the best way he knew how – through make-up. Expressed as a digital beauty series, this project features models <a href="https://www.instagram.com/therealanabobrovska/?hl=en">Ana Bobrovska</a>, the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theduponttwins/?hl=en">Dupont twins</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/princeaboraah/?hl=en">Jermaine Ampomah</a>, and model and Dazed 100-er <a href="/projects/article/44221/1/aweng-model-biography-dazed-100-2019-profile">Aweng Chuol</a>. Each turned into avatar-like characters, Alejandre used photoshop to imagine virtual make-up looks inspired by each of the model’s favourite images, music, colours, and garments. </p>	<figure>

</figure>
<p>Wanting to find new ways to connect with people during quarantine, the make-up artist says this project was the best way for him to push his visionary boundaries, at a time when innovative creativity is becoming more and more necessary in our ever-shifting way of living. “My inspiration behind this project was based on how limited in-person contact became,” he explains. “Specifically working with friends and artists that are living in other cities/countries. I improvised and applied a lot of my make-up techniques digitally.” </p>
<p>With bottom lips seemingly separated into two, decorative pearls sitting in tear ducts, and multicoloured eyes, model’s faces are subtly morphed, creating new, alien dimensions. Using earthly tones, such as dark blue, greens, and browns, the finished series evidently draws from the wildlife documentaries and anime films Alejandre was watching during the making of this project. </p>
<p>“Nature has so much life, colour, movements, textures,” he explains. “While anime is full of fantasy and imagination. Stimulated by both, I chose to apply these shapes, colours, and line work to my art using a different medium.” </p>	<figure>

</figure>
<p>Typically employing retro 90s glam to his work, most popularly seen on <a href="/beauty/euphoria"><em>Euphoria</em></a> star Alexa Demi, this creative endeavour seems to be a somewhat departure from Alejenadre’s usual style, although, as he explains, the intersection of beauty and technology has always been intriguing to him. </p>
<p>Detailing how technology has helped shift the beauty industry into something more accessible “to anyone with a phone”, Alejandro says: “Technology has provided a platform that has allowed me to express myself and experiment in the industry in such a different way than when I began my career. It has given everyone the opportunity to express, educate, and inspire.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Police in Rome have managed to identify one of the city’s most elusive street artists, according to a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/virginia.raggi.m5sroma/posts/1749438465238595">post</a> on the mayor of Rome’s Facebook page.</p>
<p>Mayor Virginia Raggi, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/virginia.raggi.m5sroma/posts/1749438465238595">boasted</a> that authorities had managed to identify the tagger, who had been “reported for defacing several buildings in our city” after a year of “coordinated investigations”.</p>
<p>Geco’s work has lined Roman subway stations and bridges, schools and derelict buildings, as well as parks and galleries for many years. Despite the ubiquity of his tag – ‘Geco’ written in blocked caps – his identity has remained a mystery, not unlike his English counterpart, <a href="/tag/banksy">Banksy</a>. But after his unmasking at the hands of the authorities, the graffiti artist now has hundreds of thousands of euros in damages hanging over his head.</p>
<p>So who is Geco and how did he get caught? Let’s take a look.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

</div>
<h2><strong>WHO IS HE?</strong></h2>
<p>Geco is an Italian street artist based in Rome who rose to local fame for his prolific tagging over many years. Due to his secrecy he was considered “uncatchable”, until very recently, and now faces up to two years in prison and heavy fines. Although authorities have not officially released his name, he is thought to be in his late twenties and a native of the city.</p>
<h2><strong>WHAT IS HIS ART LIKE?</strong></h2>
<p>The Geco tag is in block-caps and usually in black with a white trim, or white with a black trim. It appears in perilously high places, like enormous bridges, water towers, and the sides of tall apartment blocks. It also pops up regularly on street signs, bins, garage doors – essentially anything that will take paint. The tag is also littered across the city in the form of small stickers. The below Instagram account documents as much of his work as possible.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
<blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="4" style="background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px auto; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><div style="padding:8px;"><div style=" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50.0% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;"><div style=" background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;"></div></div><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CE_Y9P7j_kr/" target="_top"></a></div></blockquote>
</div>
<h2><strong>HOW DID HE GET CAUGHT?</strong></h2>
<p>Authorities had been investigating the identity of the artist for many years, putting some serious man-power into the search. However, the downfall of Geco was ultimately due to the fact that he accidentally tagged a secret-service hide-out thinking it was an abandoned building.</p>
<p>Raggi was happy to claim victory in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/virginia.raggi.m5sroma/posts/1749438465238595">post</a> on her Facebook page. “Hundreds of spray cans, thousands of stickers, ropes, fire extinguishers, cords, locks, six mobile phones, computers, brushes, rollers, and buckets of paint. This is the material that the Environment and Decoro Nucleus of our local police seized from the Roman writer known as ‘Geco’.”</p>
<p>According to the <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/14/world/europe/rome-graffiti-geco.html">New York Times</a>,</em> Geco's lawyer, Domenico Melillo, said that his client has not yet been officially charged and has not been arrested at this time.</p>
<h2><strong>HOW HAS THE PUBLIC REACTED?</strong></h2>
<p>Geco is a divisive figure among residents of Rome and news of his unmasking has prompted a mixed response on social media. Some think he deserves <a href="https://twitter.com/2010pdv/status/1314883049398697989">statues erected</a> in his name, others <a href="https://twitter.com/blogesquilino/status/1314597646049464322">sarcastically</a> refer to his status as an “artist”, while one user revealed that Geco’s ethereal presence has “<a href="https://twitter.com/2010pdv/status/1314883049398697989">haunted</a>” him for years, and says he is relieved at him being caught. </p>
<p>“Banksy goes to auction, but Geco must be denounced and treated as a criminal because he prevented Rome from shining with its own rubbish and holes,“ <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahConnor_18/status/1326487081447723008">protested</a> one resident. “In Geco I see a childish urgency, that of writing one’s name to appear,” Italian art critic Achille Bonito Oliva recently told <a href="https://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/11/10/news/bonito_oliva_geco-273871378/"><em>Le Republica</em></a>, “but I don’t see an artist.”</p>
<p>Just last month, Geco tested the patience of Romans when it was revealed his latest piece used a section of ancient Roman wall, built between 271 AD and 275 AD. Geco “tarnished the Aurelian Walls with his silly tag”, English language magazine <em>Wanted in Rome</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/wantedinrome/status/1314777651517837312">wrote</a> on Twitter. Maybe the city is glad to see him go.</p>]]>

<p>Having worked with rising French fashion designer <a href="/marine-serre">Marine Serre</a> for her latest <a href="/fashion/article/50629/1/ongoing-guide-paris-fashion-week-marine-serre-dior-margiela-rick-owens-ss21">SS21 collection</a> earlier this year, make-up and SFX artist, grills designer, and Dazed Beauty Community member <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisamchlik/">Lisa Michalik</a> has leant her artistic hand to the world of fashion again, this time creating unworldly beauty looks for a campaign for the Parisian vintage shop, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chezsnowbunny/">Snowbunny</a>. </p>
<p>With models dressed in rare 80s and 90s pieces from the store, Michalik sought to embrace the title of the shop in her artistic direction for the shoot, turning the models into bunnies, through creating large and bejewelled fake rabbit teeth. </p>
<p>Working in close collaboration with the store’s founder, make-up artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/victoriasapet/?hl=fr">Victoria Sapet</a> and stylist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marinelate_/">Marine Cuq</a>, the budding creative explains the goal of the shoot was to “give life” to her “bunny friends from Snowbunny”, creating a “parallel between rabbit teeth and bling bling manicures, accented with gems and piercings.” </p>
<p>Featuring dewy make-up, punctuated with OTT eyelash extensions, dramatic red lipstick, and orange blush, elsewhere the model’s hair has been styled into rabbit ears by the hair artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quentin_lafforgue/">Quentin Lafforgue</a>. </p>

<p>Having previously created make-up looks, prosthetics, and transformed teeth for the likes of <em>Novembre</em>, Lanvin, <em>Vogue Portugal</em>, and <a href="https://www.lisamichalik.com/dazed-korea-magazine-decembre">Dazed Korea</a>, Michalik is no stranger to merging the real with the unreal in her otherworldly beauty looks. </p>
<p>Creating vampire fangs, glow-in-the-dark grills, and marble-decked molars – which she boasts to her 15K <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisamchlik/">Instagram</a> followers – <a href="/beauty/community/article/50396/1/lisa-michalik-makeup-artist-grills-designer-interview">Michalik says</a> her fascination with teeth began after becoming “intrigued by dental prosthesis as it echoed the process of special effects.”</p>
<p>Wanting to “create again and again”, this campaign continues to highlight the multi-hyphenate creatives ability to make the strange alluring and beguilingly beautiful. </p>
<p>Shot by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/antoine_caillet/">Antoine Caillet</a>, the images will serve as promotion for Snowbunny, whose fans include Jazzelle (@<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_PMmYVKkPF/">uglyworldwide</a>) and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7iUWjKoFDv/">Bella Hadid</a>.

<p>Queen of the Ringardes Emily Cooper had most of us screaming into a pillow throughout much of <em><a href="/fashion/article/50668/1/unpacking-emily-in-paris-chaotic-avant-basic-bitch-fashion">Emily in Paris</a>, </em>as she mispronounced countless extremely rudimentary French words, got off with her sweet new friend’s boyfriend, and did the unspeakable by momentarily turning pretty much the entire fashion industry off <a href="/fashion/article/35736/1/the-instagram-documenting-the-margiela-tabi-boots-28-year-reign-margielatab1">Tabis</a>. For all those of us grimacing at her sartorial choices, however, a huge number of viewers were seemingly taking notes. </p>
<p>According to Lyst’s annual <a href="https://www.lyst.co.uk/year-in-fashion-2020/#wanted"><em>Year In Fashion</em> report</a>, which landed this week, page views on Kangol’s bucket hats soared by 324 per cent after Emily rocked the style that earned her the extremely cutting nickname ‘Bucket Hat’ from bratty actress Brooklyn Clark. Searches for <a href="/ganni">Ganni</a> skirts were also up a casual 289 per cent following the episode in which she was seen wearing a yellow asymmetric style by the Scandi label, with those looking for berets climbing 41 per cent week-on-week after the show first aired. With Netflix recently <a href="/fashion/article/51065/1/what-basic-bitch-fashion-will-emily-in-paris-season-2-provide">confirming</a> two more seasons of the divisive show are coming, the good lord only knows what stylist Patricia Field has in store for us next.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p>Other big pop cultural moments that saw people rushing to the Google search bar came via <a href="/cardi-b">Cardi B</a> and <a href="/Megan-thee-stallion">Megan Thee Stallion</a>’s immediately iconic “WAP” video, as those looking for leopard and snakeskin prints surged by 201 per cent after its release, and early-lockdown binge-watch <em><a href="/tiger-king">Tiger King</a>, </em>which gave <a href="/kenzo">Kenzo</a>’s signature tiger motif a boost of 200 per cent in April (no news on Carole Baskin’s flower crown, however). As we <a href="/fashion/article/50033/1/searches-for-marine-serre-moon-print-bodysuit-beyonce-black-is-king">previously reported</a>, <a href="/beyonce">Beyoncé</a>’s <em>Black Is King</em> visual album was a huge moment for <a href="/marine-serre">Marine Serre</a> searches, which jumped 426 per cent in just 48 hours – truly, her power. </p>
<p>Elsewhere, it was a huge year for cosy fashion (duh), with <a href="/fashion/article/47940/1/ranking-the-best-and-worst-croc-collaborations-kfc-balenciaga-post-malone-yeezy">Crocs</a>, Birkenstocks, Ugg slippers, <a href="/nike">Nike</a> sweatpants, <a href="/prada">Prada</a> shorts, and Hamp;M’s flouncy ‘nap’ dress all doing big numbers among online shoppers. No surprises that we were all over masks in a big way – searches were up 502 per cent, with those looking for <a href="/off-white">Off-White</a>’s logo version climbing 450 per cent between January and March alone. </p>
<p><a href="/pyer-moss">Pyer Moss</a>, <a href="/alyx">1017 ALYX 9SM</a>, and <a href="/martine-rose">Martine Rose</a> were among the top-ten ‘breakout’ fashion brands, with <a href="/telfar">Telfar</a> taking second place behind Marine Serre thanks to its uber-sought-after shopping bag, which experienced yet another surge in popularity when <a href="/alexandria-cortez-ocasio">AOC</a> carried it on Capitol Hill earlier this year. Notably, the progressive politician also earned herself a place among 2020’s most powerful fashion figures, alongside the likes of <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a>, <a href="/lizzo">Lizzo</a>, <a href="/travis-scott">Travis Scott</a>, and <a href="/bts">BTS</a>’s Kim Namjoon. </p>

<h1 class="fl-title">Spike Lee is making a musical about viagra</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">Finally things are looking up for 2020</h3>

  <img src="https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/786/azure/dazed-prod/1290/9/1299120.jpg" alt="Spike Lee making a film about viagra" />		<figcaption>
  <span class="fl-credit">Instagram – @officialspikelee</span>		</figcaption>

</figure>
<p><a href="/tag/spike-lee">Spike Lee</a> is set to make a musical about the creators of the erectile dysfunction drug, Viagra, based on David Kushner’s <em>Esquire</em> <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/2018/9/1/all-rise">article</a> “All Rise: The Untold Story of the Guys Who Launched Viagra.”</p>
<p>The article chronicles the discovery and marketing of the drug (sildenafil citrate), its journey from testing labs to bedside tables, and how it had to overcome challenges from Wall Street, Capitol Hill, and the Catholic church on its way up.</p>
<p>“Whose job was it to convince some of America's most powerful institutions that all men deserved boners?”, Kushner <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/2018/9/1/all-rise">writes</a>, “Two guys. This is the story of how an unlikely duo popped the top on a $3-billion-a-year industry.”</p>
<p>Lee is co-writing alongside British playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah, the artistic director of the Young Vic, and the film will feature original music from songwriting duo Stew Stewart and Heidi Rodewald.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/spike-lee-viagra-musical-film-pfizer-eone-pre-covid-miracle-drug-kwame-kwei-armah-1234616563/"><em>Deadline</em></a> about the project, Lee thanked his mother for helping him to overcome an early dislike of musicals: “I thank Ms Jacquelyn Shelton Lee.

<p>He added: “I did not want to see corny people singin’ and dancin’. Instead I wanted to play with my friends on da block… so finally going into my fourth decade as a filmmaker I will be directing a dancin’ all singin’ musical Spike Lee joint and I can’t wait. My Moms has been waiting too!”</p>
<p>Jackson Pictures and 40 Acres and Mule Filmworks are set to produce the film, while Joanne Lee of Jackson Pictures and Kushner will serve as executive producers.</p>]]>

<h1 class="fl-title">Does anyone actually want a Twitter dislike button?</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">A spokesperson for the social media platform has confirmed that the feature is ‘something we’re exploring’</h3>

<p>Over the last few years, social media users have been calling for a ‘dislike’ button on platforms like <a href="/tag/facebook">Facebook</a>, <a href="/tag/twitter">Twitter</a>, and <a href="/tag/instagram">Instagram</a>. Rumours of the feature emerge almost yearly, though the update never materialises. Now, Twitter has sparked excitement again by revealing that it’s considering introducing the capacity to ‘dislike’ or ‘downvote’ tweets.</p>
<p>Responding to a <a href="https://twitter.com/find_evil/status/1328760278037770242">critique</a> of the platform by Jackie Singh, a cybersecurity expert for the <a href="/tag/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> campaign, Twitter’s product lead, Kayvon Beykpour, said a ‘dislike’ feature “<a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392">is something we’re exploring</a>”.</p>
<p>Beykpour didn’t reveal any more info, meaning we don’t know when it might arrive, or even if it definitely will – though the prospect of it is enough to get Twitter users talking. “Apparently Twitter is experimenting with adding a dislike button,” one user <a href="https://twitter.com/sisterariola/status/1328844809998651394">tweeted</a>. “Stan wars are going to be an absolute nightmare.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
<div class="content-tweet">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">#1, 2 and 4 are literally our top priority (making the public conversation on Twitter) and has been for years. We’ve made a lot of progress but still lots to do. We do feel it’s important to solve other problems too! As for #3, this is something we’re exploring.</p>mdash; Kayvon Beykpour (@kayvz) <a href="https://twitter.com/kayvz/status/1328761697469755392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Another <a href="https://twitter.com/RadishHarmers/status/1328873735781306370">joked</a>: “I don’t want Twitter to add a dislike button. I like the site’s atmosphere of positivity and support.”</p>
<p>Some have expressed their dismay at the prospect of the feature, which they say will only heighten anxiety on the app. One user <a href="https://twitter.com/MeganRoseRuiz1/status/1328921966183550979">said</a>: “If Twitter really comes out with a dislike button, I WILL cry if any one of you bitches dislikes my art posts. My art is good and I will fight you even if I’m crying.”</p>
<p>The Blindboy Podcast <a href="https://twitter.com/Rubberbandits/status/1328836796143316994">tweeted</a>, “No, no, no. This is a website where we compete to have the best complaint, and being aggressively combative is rewarded with serotonin hits. More negativity is not the answer. Let people dislike in silence”, before <a href="https://twitter.com/Rubberbandits/status/1328837685071519749">adding</a>, “I don’t need a load of dislikes on my bad takes. I want to be either ignored or passive-aggressively subtweeted. This is the system that works”.</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
<div class="content-tweet">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don#39;t want Twitter to add a dislike button. I like this site#39;s atmosphere of positivity and support.</p>mdash; Sridhar Ramesh (@RadishHarmers) <a href="https://twitter.com/RadishHarmers/status/1328873735781306370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>The rumour of a ‘dislike’ button comes as Twitter launches its Fleets feature, which enables users to post tweets that disappear after 24 hours – much like Stories on Instagram or <a href="/tag/snapchat">Snapchat</a>. Users can share text, photos, and videos which will live at the top of people’s timelines and on the sender’s profile, before disappearing after a day.</p>
<p>“Some of you tell us that tweeting is uncomfortable because it feels so public, so permanent, and like there’s so much pressure to rack up retweets and likes,” Twitter’s design director, Joshua Harris, and product manager, Sam Haveson, wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html">blog post</a>. “Because they disappear from view after a day, Fleets helped people feel more comfortable sharing personal and casual thoughts, opinions, and feelings.”</p>
<p>Some users have criticised the feature, which reportedly allows unwanted direct messages and enables people to tag others who have blocked them. As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/18/fleets-twitter-launches-disappearing-tweets-tool-worldwide"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, Twitter says it’s still working on the feature and is listening to any concerns raised.</p>]]>

</figure>
<p><a href="/tag/aphex-twin">Aphex Twin</a>’s vintage Yamaha CS-5 synth is up on eBay – that is, if you have a spare 15k lying around.</p>
<p>The analogue monosynth contains the linear notes of <em>Selected Ambient Works Volume II</em> at the bottom, hand-etched by Richard D. James himself. The auction description also includes a statement from Paul Nicholson, who designed Aphex Twin’s logo, confirming that the etchings were photographed and used for the sleeve of <em>Selected Ambient Works Volume II.</em></p>
<p>“This synth was purchased by me in 2006 from a Vemia auction in the UK. Other than loaning it to Ghostly/Suction Records recording artist Solvent to record his RDJCS5ep 12-inch in 2011, the synth has been carefully stored at my house,” reads the seller’s description.</p>
<p>“The synth has never been serviced, repaired, or modified by me, and is in the same condition as when I received it. It runs on 230V UK power, with a UK plug. You can see some additional etchings and markings in the photos – these were all in place (and likely done by Aphex Twin himself) when I received it. It’s in perfect working order as far as I know, but I offer no guarantee of its functional condition; anyone who’s buying this will surely be buying it for its provenance.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/Yamaha-CS-5-synth-w-Selected-Ambient-Works-II-liner-notes-etched-by-Aphex-Twin/184529209534?pageci=9996e6c2-8edf-49fc-8a8b-1daf40037910">current bid</a> stands at $15,400, but with two more days left on the auction, we can expect the number to keep rising.

<p>After <a href="/beauty/head/article/45878/1/introducing-starface-pimple-patches-for-the-instagram-age">launching in 2019</a>, <a href="/beauty/tag/starface">Starface</a> – the Gen Z favourite pimple patch brand – has gained a cult following, through its determination to change the conversation around acne and skincare. Although many spot stickers have come before this (usually transparent, designed to be invisible, and to draw as little attention to the irritated area as possible), Starface has changed this approach, in a big way. </p>
<p>Its mission? To draw as <em>much</em> attention to the irritated area as possible, in an attempt to translate pimples into an opportunity for self-expression. </p>
<p>With the brand’s original big yellow star sticker a bona fide fixture in the beauty community, Starface has gone onto introduce various iterations of its recognisable star-shaped patches – creating magical <a href="/beauty/head/article/48760/1/starface-launch-glow-in-the-dark-pimple-acne-patches-and-they-are-magical">glow-in-the-dark</a> stickers, a <a href="/beauty/head/article/49202/1/starface-julie-schott-space-wash-facial-cleanser-skincare-launch">facial cleanser</a>, and more recently, spot stickers aimed to <a href="/beauty/head/article/50586/1/starface-launch-pimple-patches-to-encourage-young-people-to-vote">encourage young people to vote</a>.</p>

<p>And now, the skincare label is launching its first-ever co-created product and collaboration, with the Japanese company design Sanrio, for a limited edition Hello Kitty collection.</p>
<p>Collaborating on a shared belief that the objects we use and surround ourselves with every day should bring happiness and positivity to our lives, what better time to add some spice to your surroundings now that <a href="/beauty/soul/article/51033/1/wellness-guide-second-lockdown-self-care-exercise">lockdown 2.0</a> is in full swing? Along with helping your skin, these patches will definitely brighten up your walk to Tesco or your hourly saunter around the living room.</p>
<p>Coming in a pack of 32, in an accompanying Big Hello Kitty reusable pod, the stickers will be in the shape of the cute cartoon character, and will help accelerate zit healing by drawing out pimple pus, blocking outside bacteria, and prevent you from poking and picking. Sign us up!</p>

<p><em>Taken from <a href="/the-autumnwinter-2020-issue">the autumn/winter 2020 issue</a> of Dazed. You can pre-order a copy of our latest issue <a href="https://boutiquemags.com/collections/frontpage/products/dazed">here</a></em></p>
<p>“I feel like I’ve been here, but I haven’t,” says Letitia Wright, standing in the middle of All Saints Road. “Even though I haven’t been physically on this street until today, I’ve seen it many times.” We’re in London’s Notting Hill, outside what used to be The Mangrove. “This place got raided so many times, man,” the actress says, peering closely through a window so the yellow of her beanie and pink of her coat flicker back. Two white women with blow-dries exit the building, which is now a cocktail bar and restaurant. Wright hands me her iPhone, and I take a photo of her under the building’s blue plaque, dedicated to its former owner, before we go round the corner to talk some more.</p>
<p>In March 1968, Frank Crichlow established his Caribbean restaurant here. The Mangrove served as a vital community hub for the area’s West Indian community, and a key meeting place for the British Black Panther movement. It was also raided – and ravaged – by the Metropolitan police 12 times in its first 18 months of opening. No drugs were found.</p>
<p>In June 2020, anti-racist protesters in Bristol pulled down a monument to slave owner Edward Colston, dumping the statue into the city’s harbour in solidarity with Black people harassed and brutalised by police all over the world. Fifty years earlier, in August 1970, 150 demonstrators marched down All Saints Road challenging a version of the same story, one that is more embedded in the fabric of British cities than most would like to admit. In 1971, ‘The Mangrove Nine’ – a group of protesters including Crichlow and British Black Panther leader Altheia Jones-LeCointe – were accused of inciting riots and put on trial at the Old Bailey. The verdict was historic: after 55 days, all nine defendants were acquitted. Even more significantly, the judge admitted that the police force had been “motivated by racial hatred”. Or, more accurately, racism.</p>	<section class="fl-slideshow">

<p>Wright stars as Jones-LeCointe in <em>Mangrove</em>, the first instalment of artist and director Steve McQueen’s <em>Small Axe</em> anthology: five films centring London’s West Indian community, stretching from the late 1960s through to the mid-1980s. The Windrush scandal became national news when, in 2018, <em>The Guardian </em>reported that hundreds of British subjects who arrived in the UK from the Caribbean between 1948 and 1971 had been wrongfully detained and deported by Theresa May’s government. McQueen, who is of Grenadian and Trinidadian heritage, is interested in filling in the lives of the Windrush generation. These are untold stories like <em>Lovers Rock</em>, which spends a single, sensual night at a sweaty house party in Ladbroke Grove, and <em>Red, White and Blue</em>, the tale of Jamaican-British scientist-turned-police officer Leroy Logan, who joined the force after his father was beaten by the Metropolitan police. Together, they give a sense of a time and place – of what the era looked, sounded, tasted and felt like to the migrant families who came here. That the films will air in a primetime slot on BBC One feels like a form of justice.</p>
<p>“We mustn’t be victims, but protagonists in our own stories,” says Wright’s Jones-LeCointe, soft-spoken but utterly commanding in one of several powerful speeches in <em>Mangrove</em>. Wright embodies the Trinidadian physician and community organiser’s grace and unwavering sense of purpose. She plays her with a quiet intensity, taking fierce care with the opportunity she’s been given to “represent our elders and ourselves”, as she explains it. “If you depend on other people to tell your story – if you wait for other people to tell your story – then it will never be told.”</p>
<p>“Crichlow wanted to have an establishment where people could get together and just have food,” she continues. “It was disrespected for many years. Today, seeing that it’s a peaceful restaurant, and the people coming out don’t even look like us! It’s kind of trippy seeing that.”</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“If you depend on other people to tell your story – if you wait for other people to tell your story – then it will never be told” – Letitia Wright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The actress, who turned 27 in October, was raised in Guyana until the age of seven. She’s spent the last two decades in London, growing up in Tottenham, where she joined an after-school acting class for kids run by Black Arts Production Theatre (it still exists today). She went on to train in the opposite end of the city, at the Identity School of Acting in Brixton. Wright’s early roles included gritty British dramas <em>Top Boy</em> and Sally El Hosaini’s underrated <em>My Brother the Devil,</em> and she was Emmy-nominated for a role in <em>Black Mirror</em>. “I don’t want to leave Earth like, ‘She did a cool a little film,’” says Wright of her ambitions. “Like, no – (I’d like people to say that) what she did and who she played, who she represented and what she said – it changed my life.” Impact doesn’t come much bigger than the Marvel universe, where Wright is best known as Shuri – impish teenage sister to the late Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, and the brains behind his Black Panther suit.</p>
<p>In real life, Wright is the eldest of six siblings, though among the crew of fellow actors she’s come to think of as family, she’s the baby. “I see Danny (Daniel) Kaluuya as an older brother, and Malachi Kirby. I see Naomie Harris as an older sister. Danai Gurira, I see as an amazing older sister. Definitely, Chadwick represented being my brother,” she says quietly.</p>
<p>Her own Mangrove – her first real “gathering of like-minded people”, as she puts it – was Identity School, where she was able to find friends who became the “brothers and sisters” she still has today. “It was about having a dream – collectively having a purpose. That stemmed from (school founder) Femi Oguns’ influence, (him saying) ‘You can do anything, be anything,’” she says. When I ask what that collective purpose was, Wright puts it this way. “You have this dream, but people say you have to prepare for these huge hurdles that you are not even thinking about. It’s a refusal to give in to what everybody says you should prepare for – failure. Even if you are the first person in your family to (try).”</p>
<p>Wright explains that Identity alumnus John Boyega, who plays Leroy Logan in <em>Red, White and Blue</em>, set the precedent for dreaming beyond bit parts in TV soaps like <em>Casualty</em> and <em>Holby City</em> (the latter was Wright’s screen debut). “He was like, I’m going to book a feature film and be the lead, and we were just like, <em>What? </em>Then he booked <em>Attack the Block.</em> In that film, he played a character called Moses – in the Bible, Moses is the person that’s meant to lead the Israelites to the promised land. Moses was the torchbearer. I can see the parallel,” she says. “John influenced all of us to think bigger.”</p>	<figure>

<p>Another of Wright’s former classmates – and now her <em>Mangrove</em> co-star – Malachi Kirby recalls the day he first met “Tish”. He had been at Identity for a few years already when a new girl arrived. She was “small”, “cute” and “unassuming” – until she did her first scene. “It was like, <em>What just happened?</em> It was electric in the room. She seemed timid, but she definitely wasn’t. When she spoke, there was a wisdom. I kind of adopted her as my little sister from that day. There was something about her that I just wanted to protect,” he chuckles.</p>
<p>“It felt like she had a maturity beyond her years,” says director Steve McQueen. He says Wright’s “integrity and straightforwardness” were the qualities that stood out to him when casting her as Jones- LeCointe, a woman he describes as “resolute and uncompromising”.</p>
<p>To help prepare her for the role, McQueen put the actress in touch with the real Jones-LeCointe. “I was like, ‘Can I meet her? Is she comfortable to meet?’” Wright admits to being “a bit scared” on meeting the now 75-year-old, arriving early at a café in Finsbury Park. “She had this rucksack on, and she was shorter than I had imagined. We hugged and found a seat at the back. I got to ask her questions. I didn’t want to be too intrusive. I basically made it clear that I wasn’t trying to be her in the sense of how she crossed her legs or how she scratched her hair... I wanted to capture her spirit – the spirit of someone who believed in something bigger for her people, someone who had something to say, and something to contribute.”</p>
<p>During the Mangrove Nine trial, Jones-LeCointe and Darcus Howe (played in the film by Kirby) represented themselves in court, a strategy coordinated by the defendants that was key to their winning of the case. I tell her I’m amazed we weren’t taught about this in school. “Why would they want to teach you about nine people who got off from the Metropolitan police? About the first time race was discussed in the Old Bailey?” asks Wright, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“(My friends) have the benefit of exploring (dating apps) without somebody going, ‘Oh my God! Wakanda Forever!’” – Letitia Wright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jones-LeCointe isn’t the first activist Wright has played. At the age of 12, her first-ever theatre role was NAACP official and civil rights icon Rosa Parks. “You’re like, ‘OK, this changes everything,’” she says earnestly. “I can’t play Rosa Parks and then do something silly.” Her own political education started with her father, a chef who gave her children’s books about Black inventors and played Bob Marley and Dennis Brown records at home. He had an idea of what they weren’t teaching her about at school. “He was like, ‘I know that no one is going to take the time to tell you about how amazing you are as a Black woman, so I’m going to have to purposefully put this book in your hands and hope that you will read it,’ and I did,” she says. As for the music? “Hearing the lyrics of people fighting for liberation, and freedom, and fairness, and equality plants a crazy seed in your head very early on.”</p>
<p>Wright’s hope is that <em>Mangrove</em> plants the same seed in its viewers. “I hope it moves us forward to that place where you don’t have to wake up and see a police officer put his foot on someone’s throat. To never have to go back there again. That would be the hope,” she says, keeping her voice level. The global fight for Black liberation is an ongoing one, though the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in the spring brought a renewed energy to the conversation around police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement. I ask how she feels about <em>Mangrove</em>, a film about racism and police brutality, being released in the context of this year’s events. “I remember Steve called to give me the news about the film being selected for Cannes. (<em>Due to Covid-19, the festival was cancelled.</em>) Then he said (of the BLM protests), ‘It feels like life imitating art and art imitating life.’ I felt sad that he even had to say those words,” she replies.</p>
<p>“I’m just tired really, tired of constantly having to say the same things,” Wright continues. “We said it beforehand for years, and then you say it again, and then you say it again, and then you say it again, and then you’re in <em>Mangrove</em>, and then you’re in the street demonstrating. You say it again, you say it again, and then you have Stephen Lawrence, and then you’re saying it again. I don’t know what else to say. Around the world, we really have to get it together. It’s too much to bear.”</p>	<figure>

</figure>
<p>Despite <em>Mangrove</em>’s weightiness, Malachi Kirby hopes that people will connect with the seam of joy running through the film. McQueen punctuates the courtroom scenes with the electricity of everyday life, paying lavish attention to steel pans, dancing, laughter, steaming pots of curried fish, goat and mutton. Kirby emphasises the importance of not losing a sense of self, celebration, and joy in the midst of injustice. “To still dance, to still sing, is a form of strength and defiance. I think it speaks to generations before us and how we’ve gotten through things,” he says, describing the mood on set as celebratory. They would sing every day – “Blood and Fire” by Niney the Observer, according to Wright, inspired by its use in Franco Rosso and John La Rose’s 1973 short documentary “Mangrove Nine”. When filming the street party scenes, even the famously sombre McQueen got involved. “He was brukking out on the floor!” giggles Kirby.</p>
<p>“We forget how the little things can bring so much joy. Always in the little things,” Wright wrote on Twitter in June. She tells me British poet and activist Akala said something similar in a recent Instagram live – that “we need to promote more Black joy”. Joy, for Wright, is her little sisters – and her parents, who she admits spoil her. “If they come to my apartment, they cook for me. I’m a Guyanese kid who came to Britain, so I can do a really dope spaghetti bolognese, but the Guyanese stuff... the curries, the roti!” she swoons.</p>
<p>Last night, Wright was at dinner with a friend, and they were discussing relationships. They were talking about how to be a successful woman while looking for love at the same time. I ask if that’s something she thinks about often. “Of course, I’m going to be 27!” she says. “I just need to meet the one person that’s for me and that’s it. Done. I don’t need to do all that website stuff.” Unlike her, the friend, another actress, is on the apps. “She has the benefit of exploring without somebody going, ‘Oh my God! Wakanda Forever!’ She doesn’t have that problem,” she groans.</p>	<figure>

</figure>
<p>“Everybody’s like, ‘Hey, you have successful friends – they’re cute’, and I’m like, ‘Yeah, but they’re dating every girl they fancy,” Wright continues. “You don’t want that. Like oh, dang – you’ve got five chicks? I’m not trying to be number six. I’m just trusting that I will find the person that’s for me when the time is right. My friends have told me I’m too passive. They’re like, ‘You need to do something about it.’”</p>
<p>It’s probably useful for people to know that you’re available, I offer. “That’s true,” she concedes. “But then I have a whole thing about not wanting my heart to be broken. You can’t enjoy your blessings when you go through that,” she counters, hinting that this has happened before. In the meantime, she’s amusingly sanguine about dating. “This is what God wants me to do, so if you’re mature enough to see that, great, amazing, cool, let’s go. But if you’re not – don’t hit my DMs. Just don’t.”</p>
<p>Opposite what used to be The Mangrove is a record store. The shopfront of People’s Sound Records is painted red, yellow and green. Wright has seen it in the documentaries that she’s watched, and wants to go in. “Hey, good afternoon, sorry to bother you,” she says, striding up to the counter. “I wanted to know, how long has this establishment been here?”</p>
<p>The owner saunters over from a room in the back. “This one has been here in this home from 1988,” he says.</p>
<p>“We did a TV show about the Mangrove Nine, and I remember in the documentaries always seeing a reggae shop on this road,” she tells him. “It’s called <em>Small Axe</em>, on BBC One. And then the first film is called <em>Mangrove</em>, which is about a man from down the road,” Wright continues, shyly gesturing across the street.</p>
<p>“I look forward to it coming out,” he nods.</p>
<p><em>Mangrove is out on BBC One now</em></p>

<p>Despite being a long road through hell, 2020 is <em>almost</em> over. On the plus side, it’s now only 37 days until Christmas (polite reminder to start buying gifts for your loved ones). </p>
<p>If you know any <a href="/make-up">make-up</a> fanatics, <a href="/Kylie-jenner">Kylie Jenner</a> is making a big case for spending your money on <a href="/Kylie-cosmetics">Kylie Cosmetics</a> – announcing the launch of a <em>Grinch</em>-themed make-up collection that drops tomorrow (Nov 19).</p>
<p>”I have so many memories of reading <em>How The Grinch Stole Christmas</em> every year during the holidays, and now my daughter loves it,” Jenner says on the unlikely pairing between the make-up mogul and our green and hairy Christmas-hating fiend. </p>
<p>The gigantic collection comprises 19 products, including a 16-shade eyeshadow palette, lipsticks, liquid eyeliner, blush, highlighter, and a <em>Grinch</em>-themed lip kit (naturally). Created in collaboration with Dr Seuss, the packaging for the collection features original illustrations, including a menacing pair of Grinch eyes on the palette. </p>

<h3 class="fl-subtitle">The singer has also responded to rumours about who she voted for in the 2020 US presidential election</h3>

</figure>
<p>Last month (October 2) <a href="/lana-del-rey">Lana Del Rey</a> held a surprise book signing at a Barnes amp; Noble bookshop in Los Angeles, where she chatted and posed for photos with fans. The singer was primarily there to promote her recent poetry collection, <a href="/music/article/49939/1/lana-del-rey-releases-poetry-album-violet-bent-backwards-over-the-grass"><em>Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass</em></a>, but the book was soon overshadowed by backlash on social media, with critics and fans alike <a href="/music/article/50667/1/lana-del-rey-criticised-for-wearing-mesh-mask-at-book-signing">questioning her choice of face covering</a>.</p>
<p>The mask Del Rey had chosen appeared to be made of mesh (which is thought to do little to stop the spread of coronavirus, due to the fact it’s a porous material) and was previously seen in a cover shoot for <em>Interview</em>.</p>
<p>Del Rey’s sister, Chuck Grant, claimed that Del Rey had “tested negative” for <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> before the event. Grant also said that they remained six feet away from other attendees at all times, despite the fact that several photos show fans standing much closer.</p>
<p>“Please wear a real mask. I’m begging you be safe,” read one comment under images shared by the singer on social media. Another user wrote: “Please tell me that there's some sort of see through/sheer, woven (or clear plastic?) liner under the mesh?”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">
<div class="content-tweet">
  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lana Del Rey meets with fans at surprise book signing event for her collection of poetry, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VBBOTG?src=hashamp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#VBBOTG</a>, in LA. 📚 <a href="https://t.co/t2H7hYAvhz">pic.twitter.com/t2H7hYAvhz</a></p>mdash; Pop Crave (@PopCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/PopCrave/status/1312209620551622656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<p>Now, Del Rey has personally responded to the criticism provoked by her choice of mask, commenting under an article in <a href="https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/lana-del-rey-wore-mesh-mask-what-now"><em>Michigan Daily</em></a> that seems to suggest the response from fans – and how it could potentially affect her career – is symptomatic of “cancel culture”.</p>
<p>“Great article,” Del Rey responds via Twitter, claiming that the mask did in fact have “plastic on the inside”. </p>
<p>“They’re commonly sewn in by stylists these days,” she adds. “I don’t generally respond to articles because I don’t care. But there ya go. Same goes for everyone’s masks in my video. I’m lucky enough to have a team of people who can do that.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

</div>
</div>
<p>While she’s at it, Del Rey has also taken aim at other controversies spread on social media, including a rumour that she supported <a href="/Donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> in the 2020 US presidential election. “Again not that I believe it’s anyone’s business at all,” she writes, “but I made it clear who I voted for.” In 2018, Del Rey <a href="/music/article/41629/1/lana-del-rey-says-kanye-west-trump-support-is-loss-for-the-culture">called</a> Trump’s election “a loss for the country” and <a href="/kanye-west">Kanye West</a>’s support for him “a loss for the culture”. Meanwhile, she’s been vocal – <a href="/life-culture/article/51022/1/lady-gaga-lizzo-cardi-b-timothee-chalamet-beyonce-react-biden-us-election-win">among other celebrities</a> – in celebrating Joe Biden’s election win this year.</p>
<p>“And I don’t glamorize tough relationships,” she writes, having <a href="/music/article/49330/1/lana-del-rey-addresses-backlash-for-instagram-post-double-standards-in-music">already addressed</a> accusations of glamorising abuse in the past. “Relationships can just be tough. Period. Every other singer sings about the same damn thing. Always have, Probably always will.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not everyone is convinced by Del Rey’s explanation for the mask. Several replies to her comments raise suspicions about whether the mesh mask had a plastic layer, based on how it appears in the video. One comment also questions why it took her so long to respond to the controversy, to which she replies: “Bro I’m working on 2 albums and excitedly and happily donating a million dollars throughout the nation.”</p>                <div class="embed-content" data-embed-type="media-twitter" data-script-depends="twitter-widgets">

<p>In February this year, <a href="/harry-styles">Harry Styles</a> was spotted wearing a colourful, patchwork cardigan during a rehearsal for <em>The Today Show</em>, finished off with a pearl necklace. If you were on <a href="/tiktok">TikTok</a> at the time, then you’ll know that shortly after that the aptly-named <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/harrystylescardigan">#HarryStylesCardigan</a> challenge took the platform by storm, as fans attempted to crochet their own approximations of the <a href="/jw-anderson">JW Anderson</a> design.</p>
<p>In fact, the challenge trended to the extent that it ended up making its way back to Anderson a couple of months later, who subsequently <a href="/fashion/article/49694/1/harry-styles-crochet-patchwork-cardigan-tiktok-trend-jw-anderson-diy-fashion">shared a helping hand</a> for those looking to craft the look themselves, in the form of a downloadable pattern and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-igQBecLdKIamp;ab_channel=JWAnderson">YouTube tutorial</a>. </p>
<p>“I am so impressed and incredibly humbled by this trend and everyone knitting the cardigan,” the designer wrote at the time. “I really wanted to show our appreciation so we are sharing the pattern with everyone. Keep it up!”</p>
<p>Now though, the cardigan has reached even greater heights, with the announcement that it is set to be immortalised in a museum collection. </p>
<p>Specifically, the <a href="/Victoria-and-albert">Victoria and Albert Museum</a> has requested the knitwear for its permanent collection, as an emblem of the DIY creativity sparked by <a href="/coronavirus">coronavirus</a> lockdowns this year, and of a more general move towards more eco-friendly practices in fashion.</p>
<p>Take another look at Styles wearing the now-iconic cardigan (and Anderson’s wholehearted embrace of the trend it began) below.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><a href="/Ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a> has released the video for “34+35”, a track from her most recent album, <a href="/music/article/50925/1/new-music-friday-5-albums-to-stream-this-week"><em>Positions</em></a>.</p>
<p>The visuals – first <a href="/music/article/51101/1/ariana-grande-hits-the-science-lab-in-a-teaser-for-her-3435-video-positions">teased</a> late last week – come courtesy of “<a href="/music/article/27063/1/drake-releases-hotline-bling-video">Hotline Bling</a>” filmmaker <a href="/director-x">Director X</a>, and feature Grande leading a team of scientists in a lab. The singer also doubles as the robot they’re trying to bring to life.</p>
<p>Ariana Grande has previously called the lyrics to the track “absolutely absurd”, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0n_aqCcTVkamp;feature=youtu.beamp;ab_channel=ZachSangShow">explaining</a>: “We heard the strings that sounded so Disney and orchestral and full and pure, and I was just like: ‘yo, what is the dirtiest possible, most opposing lyric that we could write to this?’”</p>
<p>The track was released along with <em>Positions</em> October 30. A <a href="/music/article/50862/1/ariana-grande-is-the-president-in-her-new-video-for-positions">video for the title track</a> from the album sees Grande take on the role of president, signing papers in the Oval Office, and hosting press conferences.</p>
<p>Grande has also recently taken the stage alongside <a href="/thundercat">Thundercat</a> at Adult Swim Festival, to <a href="/music/article/51101/1/ariana-grande-hits-the-science-lab-in-a-teaser-for-her-3435-video-positions">perform a version</a> of the latter’s 2015 track “Them Changes”. “It feels like Ariana and I are forever connected through Mac (Miller),” Thundercat says, referring to their performance as: “part of the healing process.”</p>

<h3 class="fl-subtitle">More Radical Empathy shows the protesters bearing messages of support for Poland's queer community</h3>

</figure>
<p>President Andrzej Duda’s recent re-election has proved disastrous for <a href="/tag/poland">Poland</a>’s human rights. A right-wing conservative Catholic, the president has repeatedly and emphatically denounced the promotion of LGBTQ+ rights as an “<a href="/politics/article/49844/1/how-lgbtq-rights-are-under-threat-in-poland-and-how-to-help-fight-it">ideology more destructive than communism</a>”.  As he continues to push his deeply homophobic agenda and many regional parliaments declare their districts “LGBT-free zones”, Poland is now the <a href="https://www.ilga-europe.org/rainboweurope/2020">worst-performing country</a> in the EU where LGBTQ+ rights are concerned. </p>
<p><em>More Radical Empathy</em>, a project by photographer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rebeccazephyrthomas/">Rebecca Thomas</a>, is a poignant and inspiring series of portraits of activists from the global queer community in London, bearing heartfelt slogans of resistance against the abhorrent political climate undermining the safety of Poland’s LGBTQ+ citizens.</p>
<p>Having attended a protest outside the Polish Embassy in London this July, Thomas was deeply moved by her conversations with the protesters. “The way that these activists were drawing attention to their basic humanity was pretty powerful,” she recalls<em>. </em><em>More Radical Empathy</em> evolved as a series of portraits of the extraordinary people she met outside the Polish Embassy that day. </p>
<p>“I have spent a lot of time with the LGTBQ community here in London. And that community was my safe place for most of my twenties and thirties. Even though I'm a cis, straight woman, I always felt welcomed. And I feel that I should use whatever tools I have to give back to a community that's given me so much,” the New Zealand-born photographer tells Dazed. “If you believe in the same rights for everyone, you should support those who aren't currently enjoying those rights, this goes for any group that is oppressed.” </p>

<p>Despite not being able to go out, 2020 has been jammed full of tracks that dare you not to run to your nearest dancefloor. Making it even more difficult is <a href="/shygirl">Shygirl</a>, the London-based rapper who has captured fans with her sexy beats and even sexier (dare we say, sluttier) lyrics. </p>
<p>After releasing “Freak” – which you might have heard at the latest Savage x Fenty show – Shygirl’s latest release “SLIME” is the latest single from her upcoming EP <em>ALIAS. </em>Creatively, the release focuses on four alter egos – Bae, Bovine, Baddie, and Bonk. </p>
<p>Collaborating with make-up artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/monaleannemakeup/">Mona Leanne</a>, Shygirl transforms into Bonk for a tutorial with Dazed Beauty. “I have always been drawn to how dramatic the clown make-up has been and I did it really early on for my video ‘GUSH’,” she says. “Just to accentuate this idea of duplicitous moods. My face is saying one thing but like inside is saying another, or whatever, you know, like the face that you show someone.”</p>
<p>Using NARS, Pat McGrath Labs, Nyx, and YSL Beauty, watch the full tutorial below and read Shygirl’s cover interview from the autumn/winter 2020 issue of Dazed <a href="/music/article/51076/1/shygirl-interview-autumnwinter-2020-issue-alias">here</a>. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<h1 class="fl-title">Inside films’ most flamboyant, forgotten interior spaces</h1>
<h3 class="fl-subtitle">@celluloidhomes looks at decor throughout cinema and offers followers a bespoke ‘film prescription’ as an antidote to lockdown anxiety</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/celluloidhomes/">@celluloidhomes</a> is the Instagram account surveying the history of cinema from the perspective of films’ interior spaces. From grand midcentury modernist villas in Capri to sparsely furnished apartments in impoverished, inner-city neighbourhoods, @celluloidhomes draws your attention beyond the immediate action of a movie and diverts your eye to the often-overlooked rooms in which the story is unfolding; the decor and details which hugely affect our understanding and experience of the film but so often go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Not only does @celluloidhomes create the opportunity to revisit and reconsider familiar movies in a new way, but it’s also a really rich resource for discovering films you may not have yet encountered. Featuring a mixture of arthouse and cult cinema alongside more mainstream movies, it’s a great place to turn for ideas if you’re paralysed by Netflix-ennui (the condition of extreme malaise that settles over you when you’re scrolling hopelessly through Netflix and you suspect you’ve exhausted the whole site and it no longer has anything new to offer you).</p>
<p>In addition to the range of the movies featured on the account, its creator, Emma Paterson, also offers followers a unique on-request film prescription service. Depending on how you’re feeling (or how you’d <em>like</em> to feel) Paterson will provide you with a bespoke list of films for your personal viewing, designed to enhance or transform your mood. An ardent believer in what she describes as the “simultaneously transporting and grounding” possibilities of cinema, she began offering this free service back in the first lockdown and found people really responded to the idea of being recommended a viewing list. “Prescriptions are mainly based on what I have seen,” she explains. “I try to imagine myself into the mood of the person and I ask myself ‘What would I feel like watching?’”</p>
<p>Below, we talk to Emma Paterson about her all-time favourite film interiors, the healing potential of cinema as an antidote to chaos and anxiety, and moonlighting as a ‘film doctor’.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

</div>
<p><strong>How did @celluloidhomes begin?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>I love cinema and I’ve always been interested in the small details held in interior spaces on-screen. I began by thinking about a number of contemporary films in which luxurious, breath-taking house takes centre stage – almost as an additional character in the film. So I started by sharing images of the Schaffer Residence used in <a href="/tag/tom-ford">Tom Ford</a>’s <a href="/artsandculture/article/6465/1/a-single-man"><em>A Single Man</em></a> and the Villa Necchi Campiglio in <a href="/tag/luca-guadagnino">Luca Guadagnino</a>’s <em>I Am Love</em>. Other good examples would probably be the modernist homes in films such as <a href="/fashion/article/33563/1/watch-a-clip-from-tom-fords-new-film-nocturnal-animals"><em>Nocturnal Animals</em></a> and <em>Arrival</em>. But I soon realised that almost every on-screen home, however prosaic, is both narratively and aesthetically interesting – not just the homes of the moneyed. I decided to expand the view, first by revisiting some of my favourite films and looking again at homes I perhaps previously ignored.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“Since childhood, watching a film in the cinema has felt simultaneously transporting and grounding. I can’t quite explain it but, as an experience, it expands and anchors me at once. I can’t imagine two better emotional states to experience in a year of chaos, anxiety, and restriction” – Emma Paterson</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Could you tell us more about your interest in film interiors? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>It’s maybe easier to use someone else’s words to answer this: film director Douglas Sirk said, ‘I considered that the homes that people live in exactly describe their lives.’ <a href="/tag/pedro-almodovar">Almodóvar</a> offers something similar, saying, ‘I think décor says a lot about someone’s social position, their taste, their sensibility, their work.’ As an extension of that, I would say that my interest in film interiors is really just an interest in people and story. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>I would be lying if I said the flamboyant houses – like Casa Malaparte in <a href="/tag/jean-luc-godard">Godard</a>’s <em>Contempt</em> – weren’t among my favourites, but I’m also very partial to the small apartments in which characters live alone. There are fascinating continuities between the vulnerable New York apartments lived in by Bree (played by Jane Fonda) in Pakula’s <em>Klute</em>, and Frannie in <a href="/tag/jane-campion">Campion</a>’s <em>In The Cut</em>, for example. And I <em>love </em>Scottie and Midge’s apartments in <a href="/tag/alfred-hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>’s <em>Vertigo</em>. Often the bathroom becomes a symbolically rich space: think of Chiron as a boy in the bathroom in Jenkins’ <a href="/tag/moonlight"><em>Moonlight</em></a> – the lonely bar of yellow soap in the wall! Or the famous scene in the bathroom of what I imagine to be an upper east side apartment in <a href="/tag/jonathan-glazer">Glazer</a>’s Birth: white, eerily pristine, like a bathroom in a hotel. </p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>Could you share with us a bit more about the film prescriptions? How did you come to offer this service? And how does it work? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>This was a service I began offering partly out of boredom and anxiety at the start of the first lockdown. But I found that people really liked it and, in fact, searching for the films felt very meditative. Given everyone’s moods this year have been intensified x100, I generally ask people to talk to me about their mood and then I try to prescribe a set of films suited to it. Alternatively, I ask people what mood they would <em>rather</em> be in, and try to identify two or three films that might get them there.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>How do you put together a prescription? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Prescriptions are mainly based on what I have seen: I try to imagine myself into the mood of the person and I ask myself ‘What would I feel like watching?’ I’ve received some funny requests, including ‘I want to feel erotic‘, or just ‘chrome and power suits, please.’</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell a lot about a person by their list of favourite films? Is it quite revealing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Yes and no. Often, people’s favourite films will be underlined by a lot of nostalgia.</p>
<p><strong>In what ways do you think watching movies can be beneficial? And how can watching the right films help us through these trying times? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Since childhood, watching a film in the cinema has felt simultaneously transporting and grounding. I can’t quite explain it but, as an experience, it expands and anchors me at once. I can’t imagine two better emotional states to experience in a year of chaos, anxiety, and restriction.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">

<p><strong>What’s your day job? Would you like to run @celluloidhomes as a living? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>I am a literary agent by day, film doctor – ha! – by night. I wonder what it would be like to spend every waking hour on @celluloidhomes! I can’t quite imagine it. I suppose in another life I might have tried my hand at cinematography or set design.</p>
<p><strong>Having recently lost their respective jobs as leader of the free world and chief advisor to the PM, Donald Trump and Dominic Cummings both probably have a lot more time on their hands whilst also possibly feeling dejected and struggling with issues of self-worth. What films might you prescribe for them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emma Paterson: </strong>Honestly, I wouldn’t bother. They’re beyond help.</p>                <div class="instagram-container embed-content" data-embed-type="media-instagram" data-script-depends="instagram-embeds">
