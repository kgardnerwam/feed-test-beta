        <![CDATA[<p>We got Cynthia â€œRaise the Roofâ€ Cooper in the building ladies and gents! Question: Who was the first person to bust her ass in the WNBA? Answer: NOBODY. Coop takes us back to her childhood, and how Lynette Woodard â€“ the first female Harlem Globetrotter â€“ was the female basketball player she looked up to. She talks about the dynamic duo she and Cheryl Miller formed at USC, the decade she spent dominating the basketball scene in Italy, and how she spoiled herself with some fine Italian leather goods while she was there. Luckily, she came back to represent the USA and win some gold, and then stuck around to play in the first ever WNBA season. She speaks about her</p><hr /><p>elite Houston Comets team â€” you know, that one with Coop, Tina Thompson AND Sheryl Swoopes. Yeesh. How they won four â€” thatâ€™s back to back to <em>back</em> <em>to back</em>! â€” championships. Coop breaks down why she is absolutely made to be a coach in the NBA, and thereâ€™s just no disagreeing. Straight<em> facts</em>. Settle in and get ready for this episode. The first woman to be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, Cynthia Cooper is a legend of the game. Period.</p><hr />]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>&#34;When I was in the air, it was just me and the basket.&#34; Kemba Walker&#39;s game-winning step-back was nothing new for UConn MBB. It was a routine shot he nailed every practice. The Celtics PG outlines the work ethic it takes to become NCAA champions.  <em>(NCAA Footage Credit: ESPN)</em></p>]]>
