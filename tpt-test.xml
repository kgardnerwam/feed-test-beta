        <![CDATA[<p>We got Cynthia â€œRaise the Roofâ€ Cooper in the building ladies and gents! Question: Who was the first person to bust her ass in the WNBA? Answer: NOBODY. Coop takes us back to her childhood, and how Lynette Woodard â€“ the first female Harlem Globetrotter â€“ was the female basketball player she looked up to. She talks about the dynamic duo she and Cheryl Miller formed at USC, the decade she spent dominating the basketball scene in Italy, and how she spoiled herself with some fine Italian leather goods while she was there. Luckily, she came back to represent the USA and win some gold, and then stuck around to play in the first ever WNBA season. She speaks about her elite Houston Comets team â€” you know, that one with Coop, Tina Thompson AND Sheryl Swoopes. Yeesh. How they won four â€” thatâ€™s back to back to <em>back</em> <em>to back</em>! â€” championships. Coop breaks down why she is absolutely made to be a coach in the NBA, and thereâ€™s just no disagreeing. Straight<em> facts</em>. Settle in and get ready for this episode. The first woman to be inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, Cynthia Cooper is a legend of the game. Period.</p><hr />]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear Marv, Mareon, Murrell and Mya,</p><p>I have something to tell you. Something I want to talk about.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve mostly kept to myself up to now, and you might not fully understand it right at this moment, but I need for you to hear it.</p><p>Itâ€™s tough to talk about even all these months later, but after your little brother Marlo passed away in Decemberâ€¦.</p><p>Daddy was ready to call it quits.</p><p>Not just football, either. Iâ€™m talking just get away from â€¦ <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Leave the country. Move to Spain. Hunker down. Just us and Mommy. That sort of thing. Never talk to anyone ever again, never have to face anyone or discuss anything, just shield us all from the entire outside world. You know what I mean?</p><p>We were all just struggling so much.</p><p>Mom and me was one thing, but hearing Mya ask, â€œWhen is Marlo coming back down from heaven?â€ Seeing that teddy bear that you guys called by his name? It was beyond heartbreaking.</p><p>We always told you guys it was O.K. to cry and to let your feelings out.</p><p>But sometimes thatâ€™s not so easy. Even for Dad.</p><p>Me and Mommy tried our best to stay strong in front of you guys, and to make sure you understood that we were going to get through this no matter what. We knew youâ€™d be watching us â€” looking to us for how we were handling such an unimaginable tragedy. So we did our best. But the reality is.â€¦</p><p>I was really hurting.</p><p>Early on Iâ€™d try to act â€œnormalâ€ all day and not show any hurt, and then Iâ€™d just lie down in bed at night and itâ€™d all come out at once. So, yeah, those first few days, it all just felt like too much.</p><p>But thatâ€™s not what I wanted to tell you.</p><p>I mention all that stuff because I need you to understand the backdrop for what I <em>do</em> want to talk about. And that isâ€¦.</p><p>What happened next.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-58e022ce7f5ed12921e601bba9749d6d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr."><figcaption>Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr.</figcaption></figure><p>A few days after our little angel left us, as sad as we all were â€¦ something truly amazing happened. Something inspiring.</p><p>And thatâ€™s actually what I want to tell you about.</p><p>All of sudden, folks just kept showing up at our front door. And, at first, I gotta be honest ... I didnâ€™t want to answer. But the doorbell just kept ringing.</p><p>Matthew and Kelly Stafford.</p><p>Danny Amendola.</p><p>Kenny Golladay.</p><p>Coach Patricia. Coach Prince. Other members of the organization.Â </p><p>All showing us love. Giving us support. Letting us know that they were there for us.</p><p>I mean, you guys ... it was so moving what they did for our family.</p><p>Iâ€™m getting choked up right now just sitting here writing about it. But back then? In that moment? Iâ€™m not lying when I say that their visits, that supportâ€¦.</p><p>It changed something inside of me.</p><p>I went from wanting to be closed off and isolated from pretty much everyone to realizing beyond a shadow of a doubt that our family needed all the love and support we could get.</p><p>So after those first few visits, our door was wide open. You guys remember it. Everyone in the family flew up to Michigan. Your grandparents, aunts and uncles on both sides. Auntie Leslie even flew in from China.</p><p>Everyone rallied around us.</p><p>And as tough as those first few days were, I always want you guys to remember how our family and friends came together to lift us up and help us all get through the most difficult experience of our lives.</p><p>Local businesses and restaurants sent over food and care packages. Police and firefighters stopped by to lend their support. Friends, sports fans, and just regular folks from all around the world sent us their well-wishes and shared their stories of loss with us to make sure we knew we werenâ€™t alone.Â </p><p>It was powerful. And it goes to show something I want you guys to always rememberâ€¦.Â </p><p>It really does take a community sometimes. Sometimes you canâ€™t do things on your own.</p><p>People need people.</p><blockquote>It really does take a community sometimes. Sometimes you canâ€™t do things on your own. People need people.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>The other big point to remember â€” and this is maybe the most important thing of all in terms of your lives going forward â€” is that the good people in this world outnumber the bad by a wide margin. Those who are kindhearted and eager to lend a hand â€¦ those folks are everywhere.</p><p>Please never doubt that for a second.Â </p><p>I know itâ€™s sometimes easy to get down about the negativity and hatred and pessimism that we see online or on the news, but those people, that mindset? When push comes to shove â€¦ it has no chance against the good people of the world.</p><p>When something like what happened to us takes place, you learn that real quick.</p><p>But the important thing is that <em>you never forget it</em>.</p><p>That you never stop letting it inspire you to show that same love and compassion throughout your own lives. I can tell you for certain that the kindness and support that our family received made a lasting impact on Mommy and me.</p><p>Your mom is in the process of starting up a foundation that will help other families who have gone through what we all experienced over the past year â€” a place for sharing stories, and where families can lend support to one another.</p><p>And the outpouring of support we experienced over this past year definitely inspired us to want to do even more once the pandemic hit. Daddy looked at himself in the mirror and asked, <em>Am I doing enough to help right now?</em> Mommy did the same. And we both agreed that we needed to do all that we could to support first responders and everyone else putting their own health and well-being on the line for the rest of us. We wanted to do our part to let those folks know that <em>they</em> were not alone, and that we all had their backs, and to help them feel the same power of community that had lifted us up over the past year.</p><p>Iâ€™m so proud that you guys were with us for every step of that journey, and the joy and happiness that you each experienced from helping others is something that will be in my heart forever.</p><p>It was inspiring for me.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-6aa0304176b491a6b8abd6fc36fc525d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr."><figcaption>Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr.</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, while the struggles and suffering of the coronavirus pandemic were going down, we all couldnâ€™t help but look for silver linings wherever we could find them. And as heartbreaking as the pandemic has been on so many levels, I have to say that I am grateful that it has allowed our family to be together for an extended period of time â€” and at a moment when I truly believe that we needed that more than ever.</p><p>After your brotherâ€™s passing, we absolutely needed to be together like that, we really, really did. And for your mom and me, being able to spend so much time with you guys was a blessing.</p><p>Believe me when I tell you, every moment together this year has been cherished.</p><p>To the fullest.</p><p>Often people tend to think that the parents do everything for their kids, and teach all the lessons and set the standard, but in so many ways, it was actually <em>your</em> resilience and strength and positivity that helped <em>us</em> get through this year.Â </p><p>And at the end of the day we all made it through <em>together</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-6335d3ce4f4336c7e5e2ccc464e94627.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr."><figcaption>Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr.</figcaption></figure><p>I donâ€™t want to go on too long â€” I know for a fact that a few of you have Zoom homework assignments to get to! â€” but before I get out of here, there are just two last things I want to make sure you understand.</p><p>First, please know that during the past year you guys have brought an immense amount of joy into Mommy and Daddyâ€™s lives. Even in the hardest of times, you allowed us to see and experience what real, pure love looks like.</p><p>Sometimes us grown-ups make life so complicated, and get caught up in our jobs, or all the other things that we need to take care of from day to day. But you guys, you brought Mom and me back to our childhoods this year. Just watching you run around and jump and laugh, and then doing all those things right alongside you guys â€¦ it really was the best.</p><p>Everything became so simple and genuine and pure. You guys made it all about love, and appreciating our time together, and that really put everything in perspective for us. I canâ€™t tell you how much that meant to me and Mommy.</p><p>It was like we were both 12 again â€” playing kickball in the house, trying to remember the rules of handball, having epic Barbie doll playdates, doing double Dutch (DOUBLE DUTCH!!!) together. All of a sudden, we were back in the â€™90s.</p><p>And you guys had us laughing and smiling again.</p><p>Heck, Marv even taught me how to make TikToks!</p><p>At one point I remember pulling your mom aside and whispering, â€œAre these our kids or our siblings?â€</p><p>Because we were all having so much fun together.</p><blockquote>You guys, you brought Mom and me back to our childhoods this year.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Of course, weâ€™ll never ever forget Marlo. Weâ€™ll always remember the wonderful times we had together with him. And I know heâ€™s been smiling down on us from heaven while weâ€™ve been doing all that stuff together. I know heâ€™s proud of you guys, and he surely knows how much of a difference you made in helping your parents cope this year.</p><p>So on behalf of both Mom and I, and your baby brother Marlo, I just want to sayâ€¦.</p><p>Thank you.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-13ee366ea591b435f59f3f17bbe9ca80.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Detroit Lions/AP Images"><figcaption>Detroit Lions/AP Images</figcaption></figure><p>And last, but certainly not least, I just want to say that Mommy and me are so excited for you guys to meet the newest member of our family.</p><p>After Marlo was born, your mom and I had decided that there werenâ€™t going to be any additional brothers or sisters joining our family. But after his passing ... you guys let it be known that you had other ideas.Â Â </p><p>And, I mean â€¦ how could we ignore that?</p><p>It was probably the fastest and easiest change of plans in the history of the world.</p><p>And now, when your baby sister arrives in February, you guys can know that she is here because of Marlo, and because of what he meant to you guys. What he <em>still means</em> to all of us.</p><p>Your baby sister will be another of about a million reminders of how special Marlo was.</p><p>And, you know what elseâ€¦? She is going to be joining one heck of a family!</p><p>With all my love,</p><p>Daddy</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACnYAAAXj-a24c6578ed480a409f293e56cf4445e2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I get asked all the time now to explain the feeling.Â </p><p><em>Whatâ€™s it feel like to win your first championship?</em></p><p>It seems like a simple question to answer. After all, Iâ€™d been working toward that first championship in one way or another my whole life. But, still, Iâ€™m just not quite sure I can capture the feeling of it in just a few words.</p><p>After you put so much time and passion into this game, thereâ€™s a lot of emotion that gets attached to theÂ <em>ideaÂ </em>of being a champion. Having that validation. And the closer you get to realizing that goal without getting there â€” withoutÂ <em>actually</em>Â reaching that pinnacle â€” the more it hurts.Â </p><p>I never won a championship in high school. We lost in the Catholic League championship game my junior and senior years. Lost to UNC in the tournament as a freshman at â€™Nova,Â then to Florida when I was a sophomore. Both those teams would go on to win the whole tournament.</p><p>Then I got to the league and, well, I guess the best way to put it is that if you told someone 10 years ago that Iâ€™d one day be an NBA champion as a member of theÂ <em>Toronto Raptors</em>, they probably wouldnâ€™t have known which part was more ridiculous.</p><p>But maybe the reason I canâ€™t explain how winning a championship actually feels is because Iâ€™m still processing it all, Iâ€™m stillÂ <em>in</em>Â it.Â </p><p>And hereâ€™s the thing, even though the specific moment â€” how it felt, what it meant â€” is hard to really put into words, what I do know is that itâ€™s mine. It belongs to me, my family, my teammates, my coaches and to all of Toronto. And, man, thatâ€™s all that matters.Â </p><p>And that brings me to the next thing people will ask about sometimes: Do I think weâ€™re getting enough respect as the defending champs?Â </p><p><em>Hell</em>Â no.Â </p><p>But also, do I care?</p><p>Nah, not really.Â </p><blockquote>Do I think weâ€™re getting enough respect as the defending champs? Hell no.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>This isnâ€™t new. Toronto will never get the respect we deserve because weâ€™re the only Canadian franchise in the league. Itâ€™s been like that since Iâ€™ve been here.Â </p><p>It was a long, hard road for me, getting to the championship â€” and it was a long, hard road for the team and the organization. But we got there.</p><p>They can talk their talk, and think whatever they want. But the fact remains the same: We got a ring ceremony, and all they got is a tired take.Â </p><p>Donâ€™t matter. We still the champs.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRmDsAQBXRUJQVlA4IFTsAQDwdQa-c387ac830cb28ee346db1a97a4399f94.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Jesse D.

Garrabrant/NBAE/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>People throw it out there a lot, but Iâ€™ve never really liked being described as an underdog.</p><p>It kind of makes it sound like I got where I am just because Iâ€™m lucky.Â </p><p>Make no mistake â€” thereâ€™s definitely some luck involved. But thatâ€™s true of every single guy in the league â€” really every person who has achieved a dream they had as a kid. But when it comes to sticking in the league, competing, growing as a player to get where I am today â€“ none of that was luck. Thatâ€™s been a process.</p><p>Want to hear a real underdog story? A kid from one of the most dangerous places in America getting a four-year scholarship to Villanova.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s not just an underdog story, thatâ€™s a borderline miracle where Iâ€™m from.</p><p>No matter how big the stage or the moment, basketball is a fantasy. No matter what the result or how I play, thereâ€™s no actualÂ  pressure when it comes to basketball.</p><p>Real life is pressure.</p><p>Pressure is walking through the snow for miles just grinding it out because itâ€™s the only way you can get around. Pressure is waiting around for your cousin who has the WIC program so you can grab free milk, and maybe some Juicy Juices if youâ€™re lucky. Pressure is your mom working two jobs while also trying to put in enough time as a parent so her child isnâ€™t one of the many who end up dead or in jail.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s real life.Â </p><p>But basketball? Thatâ€™s always been a sanctuary. No matter how intense the game is.Â Â </p><p>My upbringing molded my game. Playing streetball at Connie Mack on 22nd and Lehigh in North Philly was where I got my education. My brother, Lonnie, is five years older than me, but heâ€™d always make sure I was on his team. When youâ€™re the youngest guy on the court and every other player is bigger and stronger than you, the job description is simple: Hustle. Take charges, dive for balls, set picks and doÂ <em>notÂ </em>shootÂ (but always make it when you do).</p><p>But, most of all, be tough. Thatâ€™s not optional. Fortunately, the toughness thing was always the easiest part for me. That part I didnâ€™t need to put the work in on or refine. It was inherited â€” from my grandma.Â </p><p>She passed earlier this year, and that was really tough because she was my person, you know? Like we just understood each other because we were very similar. She had this hard edge about her but we all knew how much she cared about everyone. Everything she did was for others.Â </p><p>Still, she was not somebody to be messed with.<br/><br/>Iâ€™ll never forget when I was in elementary school and got in a fight. As soon as it got broken up and I got sent to the principalâ€™s office, I was only thinking about one thing:<em> Oh damn, my grandma is going to beat my ass! </em></p><blockquote>Basketball? Thatâ€™s always been a sanctuary. No matter how intense the game is.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>I swear on everything I was sitting in that principalâ€™s office, and she was like, â€œKyle, this is serious. Youâ€™re going to be suspended.â€ And my only response was to plead with her, â€œFine,Â  do whatever, please just donâ€™t tell my grandma! Please,Â <em>pleaseÂ </em>donâ€™t call my grandma!â€</p><p>My walk home from school that day was like a funeral march. My mom has always been much more relaxed, but grandma was the disciplinarian. And I knew I was in for it this time.Â </p><p>As soon as I got home, she was there, just waiting. I felt this chill. And Iâ€™ll never forget what she said to me.</p><p>â€œWell, did you win?â€</p><p>I didnâ€™t know if it was a trick or what. I just nodded.<br/><br/>â€œUh-huh.â€</p><p>Then she gave the tiniest grin and just said,Â â€œAlright then.â€Â </p><p>And that was that. Iâ€™d gotten much, much worse for accidentally spilling milk before, but she let this one slide.Â </p><p>For a long time I didnâ€™t understand why. But once I became a dad, it made a little more sense. It was her way of teaching me about toughness. Was it a perfect way? Will you find in parenting books? Nah, you probably wonâ€™t.Â  But everyone has their own different ways of doing things and showing you their love and how to become a better person.Â </p><p>Donâ€™t fight.Â </p><p>But if youâ€™re going to fight? Win.Â </p><p>Iâ€™m proud of where Iâ€™m from, and of where Iâ€™ve made it to.Â But one thing about growing up in a rough environment is that itâ€™s difficult to learn how to trust people.</p><p>Trust is a luxury that a lot of people in desperate situations canâ€™t afford. And as a result itâ€™s easy to become isolated when you feel like you arenâ€™t in a good situation. When I left home, and especially when I got to the league, it was hard for me to develop that level of trust you need to be part of a winning organization.</p><p>Part of the reason for that is because I learned about the business side of basketball pretty quickly after being drafted by Memphis. I arrived there as a rookie believingÂ thatÂ I was their point guard of the future, then exactly a year later I was at the draft party when the team selected Mike Conley.</p><p>Honestly, it was a great pick. Mikeâ€™s one of the best in the league to this day. But of course at the time, I wasnâ€™t thinking that. I didnâ€™t see it coming at all. I had no idea they would select a point guard. As soon as that pick was made, the reality struck me that there truly are no guarantees in the NBA.Â </p><p>When I got traded to Houston, I was ready to prove to everyone what I could do. I worked harder than I ever have to get minutes and respect. I was coming off the best season of my career when Kevin McHale was hired as coach. From the very start of that year, I had the wrong mentality. I thought that because I was coming off a good year, I was the man. I deserved better treatment. And coach gave me the exact opposite. He was hard on me. Really hard on me. At the time, I wasnâ€™t able to see what he was trying to do. I didnâ€™t get that he saw that I was a good, tough player, but still had more room to grow if I was pushed.Â </p><blockquote>Iâ€™m proud of where Iâ€™m from, and of where Iâ€™ve made it to. But one thing about growing up in a rough environment is that itâ€™s difficult to learn how to trust people.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>I didnâ€™t know the answer to, Why is he being so hard on me? was simply, Heâ€™s making you better.<br/></p><p>When I ended up getting traded to Toronto, it almost felt like I was getting sent into exile. I didnâ€™t know anything about Toronto. At the time I didnâ€™t care to know. I just thought this was going to be a pit stop until an opportunity somewhere else. <br/></p><p>But then, not long after I arrived, I found that I had it all wrong. This place wasnâ€™t just a pit stop. This was an amazing city and had a fanbase that people were sleeping on. All they really needed to get it going was a winner. <br/></p><p>Those early days in Toronto we knew there was no guarantees that they would keep the team together. At that point a lot of us had been cast off by other organizations. We all got on the same page pretty quickly. We played for each other. And I met DeMar, who became one of my best friends and an All-Star, and we started building something. We had that trust. <br/></p><p>To make it to the Finals and hoist that trophy, there were a lot more sacrifices that had to be made. We lost people who had helped build this whole thing up. We let go of Case, traded DeMar, traded JV â€” moves that, even though you know they are part of the business, cut real deep.  <br/></p><p>Then we built a roster of players who all get after you. And, yeah, ultimately, we got a little lucky. We had some timely plays and we got a few bounces â€” three or four off the rim just against Philly. <br/></p><p>We did what we had to do, when we had to it, in order to get things done.<br/></p><p>And now, after all that â€” the work, the fun, the frustration â€”  only one thing matters: We the champs. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRsB5AgBXRUJQVlA4ILR5AgDw1wa-0faf2872220e6320e4f1168431c16140.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images"><figcaption>Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>One thing I know for sure is that just winning a championship wonâ€™t fulfill you. It doesnâ€™t feel like the end of a journey.</p><p>Instead it pushes you. Because now it isnâ€™t this dream or idea â€” now you know what it takes, and you know how it feels to get there. And once that happens, all you want is to do everything in your power to feel it again. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s driving me this year. Thatâ€™s what got me up early to head right back to the gym a week after our parade.</p><p>Weâ€™re going to be looking forward to Ring Night. No question about that. But once that banner gets raised to the rafters, we wonâ€™t be looking up at it too long. All the focus will be on getting another one. Because that one isnâ€™t going anywhere. Itâ€™s staying right there.</p><blockquote>Only one thing matters: We the champs.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Last month, I brought the Larry Oâ€™Brien trophy back to my house. At one point both of my sons were playing with it. MyÂ youngerÂ son, Kam, was running and jumping around the trophy, putting his fingerprints all over it. And my older son, Karter, was just sort of looking at it in amazement. Like,Â <em>How is this thing here with us right now in this moment?Â </em></p><p>One day, when heâ€™s a bit older, Iâ€™ll tell him how it got here. Itâ€™s a long story. But itâ€™s a great story.

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear eight-year-old Ronaldinho,</p><p>Tomorrow, when you come home from playing football, there will be a lot of people in your house. Your uncles, friends of your family and some other people you wonâ€™t recognize will be in the kitchen. At first, youâ€™ll think youâ€™re just late for the party. Everybodyâ€™s there to celebrate the 18th birthday of your brother, Roberto.</p><p>Usually when you come home from football, mom is always laughing or joking around.</p><p>But this time, sheâ€™ll be crying.</p><p>And then you will see Roberto. He will put his arm around you and bring you inside the bathroom so you can be alone. Then he will tell you something you wonâ€™t understand.</p><p>â€œThere was an accident. Dad is gone. He died.â€</p><p>It wonâ€™t make sense to you. <em>What does that mean? When is he coming back? How could dad be gone?</em></p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-190fdde3f5c31eb0031b99c91e3fa300.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="EMERT/Camera Press/Redux"><figcaption>EMERT/Camera Press/Redux</figcaption></figure><p>Dad was the one who told you play creatively on the football pitch, the one who told you to play with a free style â€” to just <em>play</em> with the ball. He believed in you more than anyone. When Roberto started playing professional football for GrÃªmio last year, Dad told everyone, â€œRoberto is good, but watch his younger brother coming up.â€</p><p>Dad was a superhero. He loved football so much that even after working at the shipyard during the week, he would work security at GrÃªmioâ€™s stadium on the weekend. How could you never see him again? You wonâ€™t understand what Roberto is telling you.</p><p>Youâ€™re not going to feel sadness right away. That will come later. A few years from now, you will accept that Dad is never coming back on earth. But what I want you to understand is that every time you have a ball at your feet, Dad will be with you.</p><p>When you have a football at your feet, you are free. You are happy. Itâ€™s almost like you are hearing music. That feeling will make you want to spread joy to others.</p><p>You are lucky because you have Roberto. Even though heâ€™s 10 years older and already playing for GrÃªmio, Roberto will be there for you always. He wonâ€™t just be a brother, he will become like a father to you. And more than anything, heâ€™ll be your hero.</p><p>Youâ€™ll want to play like him, youâ€™ll want to be like him. Every morning, when you head to GrÃªmio â€” you will play for the youth side, while Roberto plays for the senior team â€” youâ€™ll get to walk into the locker room with your big brother, the football star. And every night, when you go to bed, youâ€™ll think, <em>I get to share a room with my idol.</em></p><p>There are no posters on the walls in the bedroom you share, thereâ€™s only a small TV. It wonâ€™t matter anyway, because you wonâ€™t have time to watch any matches together. When heâ€™s not traveling for matches, Roberto is taking you outside to play more football.</p><p>Where you live in Porto Alegre, there are drugs and gangs and that kind of stuff around. Itâ€™s going to be tough, but as long as you are playing football â€” on the street, at the park, with your dog â€” you will feel safe.</p><p>Yes, I said <em>your dog</em>, by the way. Heâ€™s a tireless defender.</p><p>Youâ€™ll play with Roberto. Youâ€™ll play with other kids and older guys at the park. But eventually everyone will get tired â€” and you will want to keep playing. So make sure you always take your dog, Bombom, out with you. Bombom is a mutt. A real Brazilian dog. And even Brazilian dogs love football. Heâ€™ll be great practice for dribbling and skills â€¦ and maybe the first casualty of the â€œElastico.â€</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRrjDAQBXRUJQVlA4IKzDAQAQzQW-d1d2ba3a6f60b9606c4d362e93be148e.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Edgar Rodtmann/laif/Redux"><figcaption>Edgar Rodtmann/laif/Redux</figcaption></figure><p>Years from now, when you are playing in Europe, a few defenders will remind you of Bombom.</p><p>Childhood is going to be very different for you. By the time youâ€™re 13, people will have started talking about you. Theyâ€™ll talk about your skills and what youâ€™re able to do with a ball. At this time, football is still just a game to you. But in 1994, when you are 14, the World Cup will show you that football is more than just a simple game.</p><p>July 17, 1994, is a day every Brazilian remembers. On that day, youâ€™ll be traveling with the GrÃªmio youth team for a match in Belo Horizonte. The World Cup final is on TV, and itâ€™ll be Brazil against Italy. Yes, thatâ€™s right, the <em>Canarinho</em> will be in a World Cup final for the first time in 24 years. The whole country will seem to stop.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-3da79c7c85b0f1fac6eaf4d7d0799ee3.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="EMERT/Camera Press/Redux"><figcaption>EMERT/Camera Press/Redux</figcaption></figure><p>Everywhere in Belo Horizonte, there will be Brazilian flags. There will be no colors except green and yellow that day. Every single spot in the city will have the match turned on and be filled with people.</p><p>Youâ€™ll be watching with your teammates. The final whistle will blow with the score tied 0â€“0. The game will go to a penalty shootout.</p><p>Italy misses their first PK, and so does Brazil. Then Italy scores. And then â€¦ Romario steps up. His shot curves to the left â€¦ hits the post â€¦ and flies in the goal. The guys on the team are screaming and yelling. </p><p>Italy scores and thereâ€™s silence again.</p><p>Branco scores for Brazil â€¦ Taffarel makes a save for Brazil â€¦ Dunga scores for Brazil.â€¦</p><p>Then, the moment that will not just change your life, but the lives of millions of Brazilians.â€¦</p><p>Baggio steps up to the spot for Italy and misses.</p><p>Brazil are World Cup champions.</p><p>During the crazy celebration, itâ€™s going to become clear to you what you want to do for the rest of your life. Youâ€™re going to finally realize what football means to Brazilians. Youâ€™re going to feel the power of this sport. Most importantly, you will see the happiness that football can bring to regular people.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRg4zAgBXRUJQVlA4IAIzAgCwiwe-bbb95b890a43137ed5d253eb3f517882.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Bruno Luca/AP Images"><figcaption>Bruno Luca/AP Images</figcaption></figure><p>â€œIâ€™m going to play for Brazil,â€ youâ€™ll tell yourself that day.</p><p>Not everyone is going to believe in you, especially with the way you play.</p><p>There will be some coaches â€” alright, one in particular â€” who will tell you not to play the way you do. He will think you need to be more serious, that you need to stop dribbling so much. â€œYouâ€™ll never in your life make it as a footballer,â€ heâ€™ll say.</p><p>Use those words as motivation. Use them to keep you focused. And then think about the players who <em>did</em> play the game beautifully â€” Dener, Maradona, Ronaldo.</p><p>Think about what Dad said, to play free and to just play with the ball. Play with joy. This is something that many coaches will not understand, but when you are on the pitch, you will never calculate. Everything will come naturally. Before you have time to think, your feet have already made a decision.</p><p>Creativity will take you further than calculation.</p><p>One day, just a few months after you watch Romario lift the â€™94 World Cup, your coach at GrÃªmio is going to pull you into his office after training. Heâ€™ll tell you that youâ€™ve been called up to the Brazilian under-17 national team. When you get to the training camp in TeresÃ³polis, you will see something that you will never forget: When you walk into the cafeteria, youâ€™ll notice the framed photos hanging on the walls â€” PelÃ©, Zico, Bebeto.</p><p>Youâ€™ll be walking the same halls as those legends. Youâ€™ll sit at the same cafeteria tables that Romario, Ronaldo and Rivaldo sat in. Youâ€™ll eat the same food they ate. Youâ€™ll sleep in the same dorms they slept in. When you put your head down to sleep, your last thought will be, I wonder which of <em>my heroes slept on this pillow, too.</em></p><p>For the next four years, you will do nothing but play football. You will spend your life on buses and training pitches. In fact, from 1995 to 2003, you will never take a vacation. It will be very intense</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRrYGAQBXRUJQVlA4IKoGAQDwwQW-41fc50d5fdce24a4e4f6fff18017cd69.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty "><figcaption>Alexander Hassenstein/Bongarts/Getty </figcaption></figure><p>But when you turn 18, you will achieve something your father would have been very proud of. You will make your debut for GrÃªmioâ€™s senior team. The only sad part is that Roberto wonâ€™t be there. A knee injury will cut his time at GrÃªmio short and heâ€™ll go to Switzerland to play. You wonâ€™t get to share the pitch with your hero, but youâ€™ve spent so many years watching Roberto that youâ€™ll know what to do and how to act.</p><p>On match days, youâ€™ll walk through the car park where your father used to work security on the weekends. Youâ€™ll enter the dressing room where your brother used to take you as a kid. Youâ€™ll pull on the blue and black GrÃªmio shirt. Youâ€™ll think: Life <em>canâ€™t get any better than this. </em>Youâ€™ll think you have finally made it, playing for your hometown club.</p><p>But this is not where your story ends.</p><p>The next year, you will play your first senior match with the Brazilian national team. A funny thing will happen. You will actually show up to your first training camp a day later than your teammates. Why? Youâ€™ll be delayed by a match with GrÃªmio in the final of the Campeonato GaÃºcho tournament against Internacional.</p><p>Playing for Internacional will be the captain of the â€™94 World Cup team, Dunga.</p><p>You will play very well in this match. So when you arrive to the pitch for your first day of training with Brazil, your new teammates â€” the guys you watched win the â€™94 World Cup â€” will be talking about one player: the small kid wearing number 10.</p><p>Theyâ€™ll be talking about you.</p><p>Theyâ€™ll be talking about how you dribbled past Dunga. Theyâ€™ll be talking about your title-winning goal. But donâ€™t get too confident, because theyâ€™re not going to go easy on you. This will be the most important moment of your life. When you get to this level, people will expect many things of you.</p><p>Will you keep playing your way?</p><p>Or will you start to calculate? Will you play it safe?</p><p>The only advice I have to give you is this: Do it your way. Be free. Hear the music. This is the only way for you to live your life.</p><p>Playing for Brazil will change your life. All of a sudden, doors you never even knew were available to you will start to open.</p><p>Youâ€™ll start to think about playing in Europe, where a lot of your heroes went to prove themselves. Ronaldo will tell you about life in Barcelona. Youâ€™ll see his awards, his Ballon dâ€™Or, his club trophies. Suddenly, youâ€™ll want to make history too. You will start to dream beyond GrÃªmio. In 2001, you will sign with Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>How can I tell a kid who was born in a wooden house in a favela what life will be like in Europe? Itâ€™s impossible. You will not understand, even if I tell you. From the time you leave for Paris, then Barcelona, then Milan, everything will go by very, very fast. Some of the media in Europe will not understand your style of play. They will not understand why you are always smiling.</p><p>Well, you are smiling because football is fun. Why would you be serious? Your goal is to spread joy. Iâ€™ll say it again â€” creativity over calculation.</p><p>Stay free, and youâ€™ll win a World Cup for Brazil.</p><p>Stay free, and youâ€™ll win the Champions League, La Liga and Serie A.</p><p>Stay free, and youâ€™ll win a Ballon dâ€™Or.</p><p>What youâ€™ll be most proud of, though, is helping to change football in Barcelona through your style of play. When you arrive there, Real Madrid will be the power of Spanish football. By the time you leave the club, kids will be dreaming of playing â€œthe Barcelona way.â€</p><p>Listen to me, though. Your role in this will be about much more than what you do on the pitch.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRlxWAQBXRUJQVlA4IFBWAQBQOAa-b12eaffe2b895c4fdfb2a9a39e88c844.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Shaun Botterill/Getty Images"><figcaption>Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>At Barcelona, youâ€™ll hear about this kid on the youth team. He wears number 10 like you. Heâ€™s small like you. He <em>plays</em> with the ball like you. You and your teammates will go watch him play for Barcelonaâ€™s youth squad, and at that moment youâ€™ll know heâ€™s going to be more than a great footballer. The kid is different. His name is Leo Messi.</p><p>Youâ€™ll tell the coaches to bring him up to play with you on the senior side. When he arrives, the Barcelona players will be talking about him like the Brazilian players were talking about you.</p><p>I want you to give him one piece of advice.</p><p>Tell him, â€œPlay with happiness. Play free. Just <em>play</em> with the ball.â€</p><p>Even when you are gone, the free style will live on in Barcelona through Messi.</p><p>A lot will happen in your life, good and bad. But everything that happens, you will owe to football.

Itâ€™s a photo of you and him playing football together. You are smiling, happy â€” with the ball at your feet.

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear Edson (or Dico, as your family likes to call you),</p><p>Listen very carefully.</p><p>When your family moves away from TrÃªs CoraÃ§Ãµes, donâ€™t forget the socks of your mother. You are young, only five years old, but you must not forget the socks. If you forget them, your life may be very different.</p><p>You and your family will move to a very small town called Bauru. You will move to this place because of your father. You see, he plays for the football club Bauru AtlÃ©tico. In Bauru, your family has a very simple house. You and your brother share the same bed. This is not always comfortable, but because of this, the two of you will become very good friends.</p><p>In front of the house, there is no grass. Only dirt and sand. This is your first football pitch. Many larger ones will come. I will tell you more about this later. For now, the front of your house is your stadium. You and your friends cut sticks and bamboo with sharp knives to make the goals.</p><p>You do not have the money to buy a real ball. This is why you must never forget the socks. There is very little money in the family. So, you make a ball by stuffing old newspapers inside the socks.</p><p>The ball, itâ€™s not always round. But thatâ€™s O.K. You and your friends will play for hours outside, and you are called â€œThe Shoeless Onesâ€ because you cannot afford football boots, either. You will quickly learn to go around the puddles. The biggest danger is water, and the puddles will be your first defenders.</p><p>You may need to put this letter down and go call your mother to say sorry. Because you will take many of her socks over the years!</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRlJ6AQBXRUJQVlA4IEZ6AQDwKAa-8eb6585465232ea3ef96440291007669.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Ah, your mother. She is a very tough woman. As Iâ€™m writing this, she is nearly 99 years old. She still teases you to this day. When you visit her, donâ€™t tell her what you wish to talk about. She says, â€œYou are inÂ <em>my</em>Â house. We discussÂ <em>myÂ </em>things.â€</p><p>She is always the boss in the house. Your father is often away with the football club. She is the one who saves the money and makes sure you, your brother and eventually your sister, have books and shoes. She will teach you very important lessons. Thereâ€™s one lesson that you will remember for a long time. It is the lesson about your neighbor, the one with the mango tree.</p><p>One day, you bring home a mango from her tree.</p><p>Your mother asks, â€œDico, where did you get this mango?â€</p><p>You say, â€œI got it from Donna Maria across the street.â€</p><p>â€œBut you asked her for it?â€</p><p>â€œYes, yes, of course.â€</p><p>This is a lie.</p><p>She says, â€œO.K. Dico, letâ€™s go ask Donna Maria if this is true.â€</p><p>Sometimes, you are a bad boy. When you are older, you will remember this and become very embarrassed. But this is the most important lesson your mother will teach you. Itâ€™s not about mangoes, Edson. Itâ€™s about respecting other people.</p><p>Now, letâ€™s talk about your father. Many times, he will watch you play in the street. You score one, two, three, sometimes four goals. But your father is not happy about the goals. He tells you that you have to do better.</p><p>What? You do not understand.</p><p>He says, â€œNo, no, no, what I mean is that you need to learn to do the other things. You must have many skills on the pitch. Not just scoring goals.â€</p><p>This is very important advice. Remember this always. Later on, your life will change. But he will tell you the same exact thing when you play at Santos Football Club.</p><p>(It is true, Edson! You will become a professional player. Stay calm. I will tell you more later.)</p><p>After the match, your father will say, â€œYou made two or three bad passes. Why?â€</p><p>â€œBut father, we won 4â€“1.â€</p><p>He will tell you again, â€œYou must be precise. You can get better.â€</p><p>You see, your father, he is a competitive man. He once scored five headers in a game. This is a record in Brazil. When you score your 1,000th goal at the MaracanÃ£, it will be a penalty kick, and the entire world will stop for one moment to watch (this is your gift from God). The atmosphere in the stadium will be one big party, no matter what team the fans support. You will receive a trophy. There will be many photographs. This will go down in the history books. During the celebration, your father will whisper to you, â€œI have scored five headers in one game, but have you?â€</p><p>You will both laugh. Your father, he is a very special man, and he is the only reason why you chose to play football. Even after his career-ending injury, you will always consider him the best player. All you want to do is be like your father.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRrLAAABXRUJQVlA4IKbAAADw3wO-2125d8f3a4390b73c62e3da830fc052f.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>You will never score five headers in a match, but you will score so many goals (1,283 to be exact), that you become known all over the world by the name â€œPelÃ©.â€</p><p>PelÃ©? Who is PelÃ©? Your name is Edson, and your parents named you after Thomas Edison, the American inventor.</p><p>I know you are very proud of your name, Edson Arantes do Nascimento.</p><p>But cherish it now, because you will not have it much longer.</p><p>You see, there is a goalkeeper for Bauru. His name is BilÃ©. You say to your friends one day at school, â€œDid you hear of the save by PelÃ©?â€</p><p>Your friends will laugh and say, â€œHis name is BilÃ©, not PelÃ©.â€</p><p>They tease you and start calling you PelÃ©. This makes you very angry. One day, you will get so mad that you fight them. The school suspends you for two days. When your mother hears of this? Oh, no â€¦ you poor boy.</p><p>From this day on, you will be known as PelÃ© forever. But never ever forget the boy named Edson. Always remember that boy in your heart and in your mind.</p><p>When you turn 13 years old, you will play football more seriously. This is the start of something incredible for you. You start to train with the youth team at Bauru, the team of your father. This is also where you get your first job, cleaning the boots of the senior team players. They give you one or two coins for every pair. Not much money, but enough for you to buy a real ball. No more socks!</p><p>You will do very well as a young football player. A gentleman named Waldemar De Brito will come into your life. He is a very important person for starting your career at Santos Football Club. After scouting your talent, he will say to you:</p><p>â€œPelÃ©, I believe you can be a very, very good professional. But do not ever think you are the best. Do not ever think you are God. If you make money, save some of it for the future. Do not start to buy cigars and candy. You must stay the boy from Bauru.â€</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRkCsAABXRUJQVlA4IDSsAABQFQW-985f11b66c27fbbcf0aa7fe748667fe9.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Remember these words. Because you will become a professional at the age of 15. Of course, you are just a boy. When you walk into the locker room at Santos for the first time, you will watch your teammates putting on their boots. You are in awe. They are grown men. You look at your shirt number. It is number 10.</p><p>You think,Â <em>My, God. What am I doing here?Â </em>(This memory will stay with you forever.)</p><p>The director of the club will say, â€œCome here, PelÃ©. Put on your Santos shirt for a photograph.â€</p><p>There are so many light bulb flashes. And you are so skinny that the shirt looks very funny on you. The director says, â€œThe day after tomorrow, the picture will be in the newspapers.â€</p><p>You tell your father, â€œI took a picture in the number 10 Santos shirt â€” I think they like me!â€</p><p>Yes, you are still that little boy from Bauru.</p><p>Let me tell you another funny story.</p><p>Santos is a very long journey from your home. You need to ride the train for five hours from Bauru to the capital of SÃ£o Paolo. Then you need to take the bus for two more hours to get to Santos. (Bring books to read, Edson. Donâ€™t just sleep.)</p><p>One day at the bus stop in Santos, you are supposed to meet your father. You wait and wait and wait for him. You get very thirsty in the heat, so you take a walk to the beach. The water looks so clear. You dip your hand in and take a drink.</p><p><em>Ach!</em></p><p>It tastes of salt. You spit it out.</p><p>You think,Â <em>What is wrong with this water</em>?Â <em>Is it poison?</em></p><p>You will laugh at this some day, I promise. You see, in Bauru, you never saw the beach, the sand, the sea. But in Santos, there is a beautiful blue ocean. It is the first time you will see ever see the ocean.</p><p>Do not drink the ocean, Edson!</p><p>On the football pitch in Santos, you are much more comfortable. You will play for Santos Football Club for nearly two decades, and during this time you will get many proposals to join clubs in Milan, Madrid â€” all over the world. This may sound incredible to you now, but listen to my words: Do not take the proposals.</p><p>I tell you again: Do notÂ <em>ever</em>Â take the proposals. You will have many other opportunities to go abroad in your life, I promise.</p><p>For what reason would you leave Santos? TheÂ <em>Peixe</em>Â is near and dear to your heart. You and your teammates will make Santos one of the best clubs â€” not just in Brazil or South America, but in the world. The team will win the Continental Treble in 1962. There will be many Brazilian championships. You will travel places and play friendly matches all over the world. Because of you, the two sides in a civil war in Congo will call a cease-fire just to watch your team play.</p><p>You will have incredible journeys with Santos, and you will still remain close to your family. I ask again: Why would you leave Santos?</p><p>You will also begin to play for your country. It is an incredible honor for you. When you are only 17 years old, you will travel on an airplane for the very first time to Sweden for the 1958 World Cup. Many things are different in Sweden. At that time, battery-powered radio will be brand new. They donâ€™t have this in Brazil yet.</p><p>One day, the team will visit a shop in the city and your teammate, Garrincha, will hear a strange voice coming from the radio. You hold up the radio in amazement. The radio man is speaking Swedish.</p><p>Garrincha says, â€œPelÃ©, why do you listen to this nonsense?â€</p><p>You say, â€œIt is incredible. I wish to buy it.â€</p><p>He says, â€œNo, no, do not buy this. You will not understand what the voices say!â€</p><p>Garrincha does not know that when you bring the radio back home, the radio signal in Brazil will be in Portuguese!</p><p>Oh, you will laugh and laugh when Garrincha realizes this.</p><p>But when you travel the world with Brazil, there will be another surprise. And this one will make you sad.</p><p>You think everybody knows your country, but this is not the case. At this time, many people do not know where Brazil is on a map. They will say, â€œOh, Brazil, this is in Argentina, no?â€ You will smile, but inside you will be sad that people do not know your country, your home.</p><p>But donâ€™t worry too much. After the final of the 1958 World Cup, they will know.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRgqKAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-cf03a235b24ec2e26bb03a0e4bf89caf.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is because you will lift the trophy.</p><p>It is true.</p><p>This will be the first of three World Cup championships for you.</p><p>At the end of the â€™58 final, you will pass out and fall to the ground. Even today, this is a moment that is difficult to explain. The emotion is simply too much for your body.</p><p>When your teammates wake you up, you will cry. You always cry, Edson, even later in life. You are an emotional person who cries easily.</p><p>Winning the World Cup is not just a dream for you, itâ€™s a dream for your country. And to win it at only 17 years old. You are so young. And you will be the youngest World Cup champion in the history of the sport. Thank God for this victory, because you will not always be young.</p><p>In 1970, you will cry again because it will be your final World Cup. These are different tears. This will be more difficult for you emotionally. You must ask God to help you. You cannot lose for your country in your final chance.</p><p>What will happen? I will not tell you. Some things cannot be explained, even from the future.</p><p>When your career with Santos and the Brazilian National Team is over, you will have a unique opportunity to play in America. Not just anywhere in America â€” New York City, with a team called the Cosmos. This opportunity, you must take. It is very important to grow the game in America.</p><p>Before I leave you, I want to talk for a moment about beauty. You will see many beautiful things in your career. When you run to the crowd after scoring a goal, you see the faces of people crying with joy.</p><p>This moment shows you how much you mean to the people.</p><p>But there is one moment above all that you will remember forever. In 1968, you will play a match in Colombia.</p><p>During the match, your teammate Coutinho and a Colombian player start to fight. Many players will run over to try to stop the fight. When things have calmed down, the referee will give you the red card.</p><p>You will tell him, â€œNo, no, I did not fight. I tried to help.â€ But still, the referee forces you off the field. He thinks you did it because you look similar to Coutinho.</p><p>You leave the pitch in anger and walk to the locker room. Then, when you take off your boots, you start to hear noise. The crowd is yelling about something.</p><p>Your coach runs into the locker room and says, â€œPelÃ©, come back! You have to come back!â€</p><p>You say, â€œWhat? I am not allowed to go back. I got a red card.â€</p><p>Your coach says, â€œNo, you do not understand. Do not take off your boots. The crowd, they started to make noise. They have made a protest!â€</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRrCpAABXRUJQVlA4IKSpAAAQcQO-4abc1fe3e55def923bae123ccaa7bcc5.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>This is the first and only time in your life that you will see something like this. The Colombian crowd has seen the mistake. They are chanting for PelÃ© to come back.</p><p>The referee who makes the mistake is substituted with a new referee. Never in football do they take the referee out and let the player return to the pitch. You see, the crowd has such a passion for the beautiful game. They donâ€™t care that you are the opponent.</p><p>You come back to the pitch, and the crowd roars.</p><p>This moment shows you how much you mean to the people.</p><p>Do you see? God has given you a brilliant life.</p><p>Pray to Him:Â <em>Take care of my family</em>. You need to take care of one another. This I promise you.</p><p>But there is another thing I want you to pray for every night. This is more difficult to explain. In Brazil, the people are beautiful. We have amazing food, music, culture. But we have many problems. There is crime and poverty. Yes, even to this day when I write to you, Edson, our country still suffers.</p><p>You must pray to God:<em>Â Please make things better in Brazil</em>. There are still kids in Brazil playing football barefoot in the streets. There are still kids not able to afford a ball. There are still kids in Brazil stealing mangoes. This is very sad. Football cannot give to everyone what it gave to you.</p><p>What is your magic moment? It was when you were born. Because you have an excellent family that has taught and treated you well. And this is why, when you travel all over the world, the door is always open to welcome you. The people of the world gave you the greatest love, and you must do your best to give it back.</p><p>Remain the boy from Brazil. Remain Edson. And remember these three words: honesty, patience and respect.</p><p>Keep the ball rolling,</p><p>Edson Arantes do Nascimento</p><p>2016</p><p>                                                                                                      ***</p><p><em>The movie â€œPelÃ©: Birth of a Legendâ€ is now available on </em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B01F9H7QIW" target="_blank"><em>Amazon </em></a><em>and </em><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/pele-birth-of-a-legend/id1103700819" target="_blank"><em>iTunes</em></a></p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-4ff4bba55f8133196bc1f8af90a221ad.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>I</strong> remember the exact moment I knew we were broke. I can still picture my mum at the refrigerator and the look on her face.<br/><br/>I was six years old, and I came home for lunch during our break at school. My mum had the same thing on the menu every single day: Bread and milk. When youâ€™re a kid, you donâ€™t even think about it. But I guess thatâ€™s what we could afford.<br/><br/>Then this one day I came home, and I walked into the kitchen, and I saw my mum at the refrigerator with the box of milk, like normal. But this time she was mixing something in with it. She was shaking it all up, you know? I didnâ€™t understand what was going on. Then she brought my lunch over to me, and she was smiling like everything was cool. But I realized right away what was going on.<br/><br/>She was mixing water in with the milk. We didnâ€™t have enough money to make it last the whole week. We were broke. Not just poor, but broke.<br/><br/>My father had been a pro footballer, but he was at the end of his career and the money was all gone. The first thing to go was the cable TV. No more football. No more Match of the Day. No signal.<br/><br/>Then Iâ€™d come home at night and the lights would be shut off. No electricity for two, three weeks at a time.<br/><br/>Then Iâ€™d want to take a bath, and there would be no hot water. My mum would heat up a kettle on the stove, and Iâ€™d stand in the shower splashing the warm water on top of my head with a cup.<br/><br/>There were even times when my mum had to â€œborrowâ€ bread from the bakery down the street. The bakers knew me and my little brother, so theyâ€™d let her take a loaf of bread on Monday and pay them back on Friday.<br/><br/>I knew we were struggling. But when she was mixing in water with the milk, I realized it was <em>over</em>, you know what I mean? This was our life.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRlq7AQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-c4ca1047a51a9d3a58bdc1485d2df4cb.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>I didnâ€™t say a word. I didnâ€™t want her to stress. I just ate my lunch. But I swear to God, I made a promise to myself that day. It was like somebody snapped their fingers and woke me up. I knew exactly what I had to do, and what I was <em>going </em>to do.<br/><br/>I couldnâ€™t see my mother living like that. Nah, nah, nah. I couldnâ€™t have that.<br/><br/>People in football love to talk about mental strength. Well, Iâ€™m the strongest dude youâ€™re ever going to meet. Because I remember sitting in the dark with my brother and my mom, saying our prayers, and thinking, believing, <em>knowing </em>â€¦ itâ€™s going to happen.<br/><br/>I kept my promise to myself for a while. But then some days Iâ€™d come home from school and find my mum crying. So I finally told her one day, â€œMum, itâ€™s gonna change. Youâ€™ll see. Iâ€™m going to play football for Anderlecht, and itâ€™s going to happen soon. Weâ€™ll be good. You wonâ€™t have to worry anymore.â€<br/><br/>I was six.<br/><br/>I asked my father, â€œWhen can you start playing professional football?â€<br/><br/>He said, â€œSixteen.â€<br/><br/>I said, â€œO.K., sixteen then.â€<br/><br/>It was going to happen. Period.<br/><br/>Let me tell you something â€” every game I ever played was a Final. When I played in the park, it was a Final. When I played during break in kindergarten, it was a Final. Iâ€™m dead-ass serious. I used to try to tear the cover off the ball every time I shot it. Full power. We werenâ€™t hitting R1, bro. No finesse shot. I didnâ€™t have the new <em>FIFA</em>. I didnâ€™t have a Playstation. I wasnâ€™t playing around. I was trying to <em>kill </em>you.<br/><br/>When I started growing taller, some of the teachers and the parents would be stressing me. Iâ€™ll never forget the first time I heard one of the adults say, â€œHey, how old are you? What year were you born?â€<br/><br/>Iâ€™m like, <em>What? Are you serious?</em><br/><br/>When I was 11 years old, I was playing for the LiÃ¨rse youth team, and one of the parents from the other team literally tried to stop me from going on the pitch. He was like, â€œHow old is this kid? Where is his I.D.? Where is he from?â€<br/><br/>I thought, <em>Where am I from? What? I was born in Antwerp. Iâ€™m from Belgium.<br/></em><br/>My dad wasnâ€™t there, because he didnâ€™t have a car to drive to my away games. I was all alone, and I had to stand up for myself. I went and got my I.D. from my bag and showed it to all the parents, and they were passing it around inspecting it, and I remember the blood just rushing through me â€¦ and I thought, â€œOh, Iâ€™m gonna <em>kill </em>your son even more now. I was already going to kill him, but now Iâ€™m gonna destroy him. Youâ€™re gonna drive the boy home crying now.â€</p><p>I wanted to be the best footballer in Belgian history. That was my goal. Not good. Not great. The best. I played with so much anger, because of a lot of things â€¦ because of the rats running around in our apartment â€¦ because I couldnâ€™t watch the Champions League â€¦ because of how the other parents used to look at me.<br/><br/>I was on a mission.<br/><br/>When I was 12, I scored 76 goals in 34 games.<br/><br/>I scored them all wearing my dadâ€™s shoes. Once our feet got to be the same size, we used to share.<br/><br/>One day I called up my grandfather â€” my mumâ€™s dad. He was one of the most important people in my life. He was my connection back to Congo, where my mum and dad are from. So I was on the phone with him one day, and I said, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m doing really well. I scored 76 goals, and we won the league. The big teams are noticing me.â€<br/><br/>And usually, he always wanted to hear about my football. But this time it was strange. He said, â€œYeah, Rom. Yeah, thatâ€™s great. But can you do me a favor?â€<br/><br/>I said, â€œYeah, what is it?â€<br/><br/>He said, â€œCan you look after my daughter, please?â€<br/><br/>I remember being so confused. Like, <em>whatâ€™s Grandad on about?</em><br/><br/>I said, â€œMum? Yeah, weâ€™re cool. Weâ€™re O.K.â€<br/><br/>He said, â€œNo, promise me. Can you promise me? Just look after my daughter. Just look after her for me, O.K.?â€<br/><br/>I said, â€œYeah, Granddad. I got it. I promise you.â€<br/><br/>Five days later he passed away. And then I understood what he really meant.<br/><br/>It makes me so sad to think about, because I just wish that he could have lived another four years to see me play for Anderlecht. To see that I kept my promise, you know? To see that everything was going to be O.K.<br/><br/>I told my mum that I would make it at 16.<br/><br/>I was late by 11 days.<br/><br/>May 24, 2009.<br/><br/>The playoff final. Anderlecht vs. Standard LiÃ¨ge.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRpASAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-01fe422029bf2d612ce73af54b284552.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="John Thys/AFP/Getty Images"><figcaption>John Thys/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That was the craziest day of my life. But we have to back up for a minute. Because at the start of the season, I was barely playing for the Anderlecht U-19s. The coach had me coming off the bench. Iâ€™m like, â€œHow the hell am I going to sign a pro contract on my 16th birthday if Iâ€™m still on the bench for the U-19s?â€<br/><br/>So I made a bet with our coach.<br/><br/>I told him, â€œIâ€™ll guarantee you something. If you actually play me, Iâ€™m going to score 25 goals by December.â€<br/><br/>He laughed. He literally laughed at me.<br/><br/>I said, â€œLetâ€™s make a bet then.â€<br/><br/>He said, â€œO.K., but if you donâ€™t score 25 by December, youâ€™re going to the bench.â€<br/><br/>I said, â€œFine, but if I win, youâ€™re going to clean all the minivans that take the players home from training.â€<br/><br/>He said, â€œO.K., itâ€™s a deal.â€<br/><br/>I said, â€œAnd one more thing. You have to make pancakes for us every day.â€<br/><br/>He said, â€œO.K., fine.â€<br/><br/>That was the dumbest bet that man ever made.<br/><br/>I had 25 by November. We were eating pancakes before Christmas, bro.<br/><br/>Let that be a lesson. You donâ€™t play around with a boy whoâ€™s hungry!</p><p>I signed my pro contract with Anderlecht on my birthday, May 13. Went straight out and bought the new <em>FIFA </em>and a cable package. It was already the end of the season, so I was at home chilling. But the Belgian league was crazy that year, because Anderlecht and Standard Liege had finished tied on points. So there was a two-leg playoff to decide the title.<br/><br/>During the first leg, Iâ€™m at home watching on TV like a fan.<br/><br/>Then the day before the second leg, I get a phone call from the coach of the reserves.<br/><br/>â€œHello?â€<br/><br/>â€œHello, Rom. What are you doing?â€<br/><br/>â€œAbout to go play football in the park.â€<br/><br/>â€œNo, no, no, no, no. Pack your bags. Right now.â€<br/><br/>â€œWhat? What did I do?â€<br/><br/>â€œNo, no, no. You need to get to the stadium right now. The first team wants you now.â€<br/><br/>â€œYo â€¦. What?! Me?!â€<br/><br/>â€œYeah, you. Come now.â€<br/><br/>I literally sprinted into my dadâ€™s bedroom and was like, â€œYo! Get your ass up right now! We gotta go, man!â€<br/><br/>Heâ€™s like, â€œHuh? What? Go where?â€<br/><br/>Iâ€™m like, â€œANDERLECHT, MAN.â€<br/><br/>Iâ€™ll never forget, I showed up to the stadium, and I like pretty much <em>ran </em>into the dressing room and the kitman said, â€œO.K., kid, what number do you want?â€<br/><br/>And I said, â€œGive me number 10.â€</p><blockquote>The kitman said, â€œO.K., kid, what number do you want?â€ And I said, â€œGive me number 10.â€<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Hahahaha! I donâ€™t know. I was too young to be scared I guess.<br/><br/>He was like, â€œAcademy players have to take 30 and above.â€<br/><br/>I said, â€œO.K., well, three plus six equals nine, and thatâ€™s a cool number, so give me 36.â€<br/><br/>That night at the hotel, the senior players made me sing a song for them at dinner. I canâ€™t even remember what I picked. My head was spinning.<br/><br/>The next morning, my friend literally knocked on the door of my house to see if I wanted to play football and my mum was like, â€œHeâ€™s out playing.â€<br/><br/>My friend said, â€œPlaying where?â€<br/><br/>She said, â€œThe final.â€<br/><br/>We got off the bus at the stadium, and every single player walked in wearing a cool suit. Except me. I came off the bus wearing a terrible tracksuit, and all the TV cameras were right in my face. The walk to the locker room was like 300 meters. Maybe a three-minute walk. As soon as I put my foot in the locker room, my phone starts blowing up. Everybody had seen me on TV. I had 25 messages in three minutes. My friends were going crazy.<br/><br/>â€œBro?! WHY ARE YOU AT THE GAME?!â€<br/><br/>â€œRom, what is happening? WHY ARE YOU ON TV?â€<br/><br/>The only person I texted back was my best friend. I said, â€œBro, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m gonna play. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on. But just keep watching the TV.â€<br/><br/>In the 63rd minute, the manager subbed me on.<br/><br/>I ran out onto the field for Anderlecht at 16 years and 11 days old.<br/><br/>We lost the final that day, but I was already in heaven. I made good on my promise to my mother and to my grandad. That was the moment I knew we were gonna be O.K.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRnLCAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-99b8fe6701997a7e0becd6512680ea7c.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>The next season, I was still finishing up my last year of high school and playing in the Europa League at the same time. I used to have to take a big bag to school so I could catch a flight in the afternoon. We won the league by a mile, and I finished second for African Player of the Year. It was just â€¦ crazy.<br/><br/>I actually expected all that to happen, but maybe not so fast. All of sudden, the media was building me up, and putting all these expectations on me. Especially with the national team. For whatever reason, I just wasnâ€™t playing well for Belgium. It wasnâ€™t working out.<br/><br/>But, yo â€” come on. I was 17! 18! 19!<br/><br/>When things were going well, I was reading newspapers articles and they were calling me Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian striker.<br/><br/>When things werenâ€™t going well, they were calling me Romelu Lukaku, the Belgian striker of Congolese descent.<br/><br/>If you donâ€™t like the way I play, thatâ€™s fine. But I was born here. I grew up in Antwerp, and LiÃ¨ge and Brussels. I dreamed of playing for Anderlecht. I dreamed of being Vincent Kompany. Iâ€™ll start a sentence in French and finish it in Dutch, and Iâ€™ll throw in some Spanish or Portuguese or Lingala, depending on what neighborhood weâ€™re in.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m Belgian.<br/><br/>Weâ€™re <em>all </em>Belgian. Thatâ€™s what makes this country cool, right?<br/><br/>I donâ€™t know why some people in my own country want to see me fail. I really donâ€™t. When I went to Chelsea and I wasnâ€™t playing, I heard them laughing at me. When I got loaned out to West Brom, I heard them laughing at me.<br/><br/>But itâ€™s cool. Those people werenâ€™t with me when we were pouring water in our cereal. If you werenâ€™t with me when I had nothing, then you canâ€™t really understand me.<br/><br/>You know whatâ€™s funny? I missed 10 <em>years </em>of Champions League football when I was a kid. We never could afford it. I would come into school and all the kids would be talking about the final, and Iâ€™d have no idea what happened. I remember back in 2002, when Madrid played Leverkusen, everybody was like, â€œThe volley! Oh my God, the <em>volley</em>!â€<br/><br/>I had to pretend like I knew what they were talking about.<br/><br/>Two weeks later, we were sitting in computer class, and one of my friends downloaded the video off the Internet, and I finally saw Zidane smash it into the top corner with his left.<br/><br/>That summer, I went over to his house so I could watch Ronaldo <em>Fenomeno </em>in the World Cup Final. Everything else from that tournament is just a story I heard from the kids at school.<br/><br/>Ha! I remember I had holes in my shoes in 2002. Big holes.<br/><br/>Twelve years later, I was <em>playing</em> in the World Cup.<br/><br/>Now Iâ€™m about to play in another World Cup, and you know what? Iâ€™m going to remember to have fun this time. Life is too short for the stress and the drama. People can say whatever they want about our team, and about me.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRtywAABXRUJQVlA4INCwAADQAwS-ffd1ab888896f8edf796ef6d3977774d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Mark J.

Now Iâ€™m learning from him every day with the national team. Iâ€™m standing with the legend, in the flesh, and heâ€™s telling me all about how to run into space like he used to do. Thierry might be the only guy in the world who watches more football than me. We debate everything. Weâ€™re sitting around and having debates about German second division football.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m like, â€œThierry, have you seen the Fortuna DÃ¼sseldorf setup, though?â€<br/><br/>Heâ€™s like, â€œDonâ€™t be silly. Yes, of course.â€<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s the coolest thing in the world, to me.<br/><br/>I just really, really wish my grandad was around to witness this.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m not talking about the Premier League.<br/><br/>Not Manchester United.<br/><br/>Not the Champions League.<br/><br/>Not the World Cups.<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s not what I mean. I just wish he was around to see the life we have now. I wish I could have one more phone call with him, and I could let him know â€¦<br/><br/>â€œSee? I told you. Your daughter is OK. No more rats in the apartment. No more sleeping on the floor. No more stress. Weâ€™re good now. Weâ€™re good â€¦<br/><br/>â€¦ They donâ€™t have to check the I.D. any more.

I have some good news and some bad news for you.Â The truth is that I am really here to speak to you about your soul.</p><p>Yes, your soul. You do have one, believe it or not.Â </p><p>Letâ€™s begin with the bad news. Youâ€™re 17 years old. Youâ€™re about to become a real footballer, like in your dreams. You think that you know everything. But the truth is, my friend, you donâ€™t know shit.Â </p><p>In just a few days, you will get the chance to start your first Serie A match for Parma, and you donâ€™t know enough to be scared. You should be in bed, drinking warm milk. But what are you going to do? Youâ€™re going to go to the nightclub with your good friend from the Primavera.Â </p><p>Youâ€™re just going to have one beer, right?Â </p><p>But then you exaggerate a bit. You play the movie character. The strongman. This is how you usually cope with this pressure that you donâ€™t even know that you feel. Soon, youâ€™ll be outside the club, arguing with some police officers at one in the morning.Â </p><p>Just go home. Go to bed.Â </p><p>And please, I beg you, donâ€™t piss on the wheel of the police car. The officers will not find it amusing, the club will not find it amusing, and you will risk everything that youâ€™ve worked for.Â </p><p>This is the kind of chaos that you bring upon yourself, for no reason. There is a burning inside you that will lead you to make mistakes. Of course, you think that you are showing your teammates that youâ€™re strong and free, but in reality, this is a mask that you wear.</p><p>In just a few days, you will be gifted with three things that are very, very intoxicating, but also very, very dangerous.Â </p><p>Money, fame, and the job of your dreams.Â </p><p>Now, youâ€™re surely thinking,Â <em>What could possibly be dangerous about this?Â </em></p><p>Well, this is a paradox.Â </p><p>On one hand, itâ€™s true that a keeper needs confidence. He needs to be fearless. If you give a manager the choice between the greatest technical keeper in the world, and the most fearless keeper in the world, I guarantee you that he will choose the fearless bastard every single time.Â </p><p>On the other hand, a person who is fearless can easily forget that they have a mind. If you live your life in a nihilistic way, thinking only about football, your soul will start to wither. Eventually, you will become so depressed that you wonâ€™t even want to leave your bed.Â </p><p>You can laugh if you want, but this will happen to you. It will happen at the height of your career, when you have everything a man could ever want in life. You will be 26 years old. The keeper of Juventus and the Italian national team. You will have money and respect. People will even call you Superman.</p><p>But youâ€™re no superhero. Youâ€™re just a man like anyone else. And the truth is that the pressure of this profession can turn you into a robot. Your routine can become a prison. You go to training. You come home and watch TV. You go to sleep. You do the same the next day. You win. You lose. It repeats and repeats.Â </p><p>One morning, when you get out of bed to go to training, your legs will start shaking uncontrollably. You will be so weak that you wonâ€™t be able to drive your car. Initially, you will think itâ€™s just fatigue, or a virus. But then it will get worse. All youâ€™ll want to do is sleep. At training, every save will feel like a titanic effort. For seven months, you will have a hard time finding joy in life.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRmTOAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-5d8fcfde38d9550e6d4d9f515565f4ca.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Claudio Villa/Getty Images"><figcaption>Claudio Villa/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>At this moment, we must pause.Â </p><p>Because I know what youâ€™re thinking reading this, at 17 years old.Â </p><p>You are saying, â€œHow is this possible? I am a happy person. I am a born leader. If I will be the keeper for Juventus, making millions, then I must be happy. It is impossible to be depressed.â€Â </p><p>Well, I must ask you an important question.Â <em>Why</em>Â did you decide to devote your life to football, Gigi? Do you remember?Â </p><p>And, please, do not just say that it was because of Thomas Nâ€™Kono. You must go deeper than that. You have to remember every detail.Â </p><p>You were 12, yes.Â </p><p>The 1990 World Cup was in Italy, yes.Â </p><p>The first match was Argentina vs. Cameroon at the San Siro, yes.Â </p><p>But where were you during the first match? Close your eyes. You were in your living room, all alone. Why werenâ€™t your friends there, like usual? You canâ€™t recall. Your grandmother was in the kitchen, making lunch. And it was so hot that day that she shut all the windows to make the room more fresh. It was completely dark, except for the yellow glow of the television.Â </p><p>What do you see?Â </p><p>You see this strange name. CAMEROON.Â </p><p>You donâ€™t know where Cameroon is. You didnâ€™t even know such a place existed before this moment. Of course, you know Argentina and Maradona, but there is something magical about the players from Cameroon. Itâ€™s so hot under the summer sun, but their keeper is still wearing a full suit. Long black pants. Long green shirt with the pink collar. The way he moves, the way he stands tall, the fantastic mustache. He captivates your heart in a way that is unexplainable.</p><p>He is the coolest man you have ever seen.</p><p>The commentator says his name is Thomas Nâ€™Kono.Â </p><p>Then, magic.Â </p><p>Thereâ€™s a corner for Argentina, and Thomas runs out into the crowd and punches the ball 30 yards in the air. This is the moment that you know what you want to do with your life.</p><p>You do not want to be simply a goalkeeper.Â </p><p>You want to beÂ <em>this</em>Â kind of goalkeeper.Â </p><p>You want to be wild, courageous, free.Â </p><p>Minute after minute, watching this match, you become who you are. Your life is being written. Cameroon scores, and you become so nervous for them to hang on that you cannot physically take it anymore. You leap off the couch. You spend the entire second half pacing around the television stand. When Cameroon has a second man sent off, you cannot even bear to listen.Â </p><p>For the final five minutes, you crouch behind the television with the sound off.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-1e1f76447feaade10abdfc3f3bb67ace.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Gianluigi Buffon"><figcaption>Courtesy of Gianluigi Buffon</figcaption></figure><p>You peek out every once in a while to see whatâ€™s happening, then retreat.Â </p><p>Finally, you peek out, and the Cameroon players are celebrating. You run straight out into the street. Two other kids from your neighborhood do the same thing. Everyone is yelling, â€œDid you see Cameroon? Did you see Cameroon?â€Â </p><p>That day, a fire is born inside of you. Cameroon is a place that exists. Thomas Nâ€™Kono is a man who exists. You will show the world that Buffon exists.Â </p><p><em>ThisÂ </em>is why you became a footballer. Not because of money or fame. Because of the artistry and style of this man Thomas Nâ€™Kono. Because of hisÂ <em>soul</em>.Â </p><p>You must remember this: money and fame isnâ€™t the purpose. If you are not taking care of your soul, if you are not looking for inspiration in things outside of football, you will deteriorate. If I could give you one piece of advice, it is to be much more curious about the world around you when you are still young. You will save yourself, and especially your family, a lot of heartache.Â </p><p>To be a keeper is to be courageous, it is true.Â </p><p>But to be courageous is not to be ignorant, Gigi.</p><p>At the depths of your depression, something strange and beautiful will happen. One morning, you will decide to break your routine and go to a different restaurant in Torino for breakfast. So youâ€™ll take a new route through the city, and youâ€™ll walk past an art museum.Â </p><p>The poster outside will say CHAGALL.Â </p><p>You have heard this name before. But you donâ€™t know about art.Â </p><p>You have things to do.Â </p><p>You must be on your way.Â </p><p>You are Buffon.Â </p><p>But who is Buffon?Â </p><p>WhoÂ <em>are</em>Â you, really?</p><p>Do you know?</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRkgoAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-1b44c19916c014d9b8509394fd7a9688.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP Photo"><figcaption>Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>This is the most important part of this letter. YouÂ <em>have</em>Â to walk into that museum, on that specific day. It will be the most important decision of your life.Â </p><p>If you do not walk into that museum, and you carry on with your life as a footballer, as Superman, then you will continue to lock all of your feelings away in the cellar, and your soul will deteriorate.Â </p><p>But if you go inside, you will see hundreds of paintings by Chagall. Most of them will do nothing to stir you. Some good, some interesting, some that say nothing to you at all.Â </p><p>But then you will see one specific painting that will hit you like a lightning bolt.Â </p><p>It is calledÂ <em>The Walk</em>.</p><p>Itâ€™s an almost childlike image. A man and a woman are in a park, having a picnic, but everything is magical. The woman is flying away into the sky, like an angel, and the man is standing on the ground, holding her hand, smiling.Â </p><p>It is like the dream of a child.Â </p><p>This image will transmit something from another world. It will give you the feeling of a child. The feeling of happiness in simplicity.Â </p><p>The feeling of Thomas Nâ€™Kono punching the ball 30 yards.Â </p><p>The feeling of your grandmother calling to you from the kitchen.Â </p><p>The feeling of sitting behind the television in the dark, praying.Â </p><p>As we get older, we can easily forget these feelings.Â </p><p>You must go back to the museum the very next day. It is essential.Â </p><p>The woman at the ticket booth will look at you in a funny way. Sheâ€™ll say, â€œWerenâ€™t you just here yesterday?â€Â </p><p>It doesnâ€™t matter. Go back inside. This art will be the best cure for you. When you open up your mind, the inner heaviness that you feel will be lifted, like the woman being lifted into the air in Chagallâ€™s painting.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRmbBAgBXRUJQVlA4IFrBAgCQAAy-56d23fbefcc1d52391973deb0b64c88b.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty Images"><figcaption>Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>There is an incredible irony in this moment. Sometimes I think that life must be written for us. So many unexplainable and beautiful things that will happen to you that seem to be connected. This is one of them.Â </p><p>Because when you are a young player for Parma, you will do something out of ignorance that will mark you. Before a big match, youâ€™ll want to make a big gesture to show your teammates and the fans that you are a leader, you are courageous, you are a big character.Â </p><p>So you will write a message on your shirt that you once saw carved on a desk when you were at school.Â </p><p>Youâ€™ll write, â€œDeath to Cowards.â€Â </p><p>You think itâ€™s just a motivational cry.Â </p><p>You donâ€™t know that it is a slogan of the far-right fascists.Â </p><p>This is one of the mistakes thatÂ will cause your family a lot of pain. But these mistakes are important, because they remind you that youâ€™re human. They will remind you, again and again, that you donâ€™t know shit, my friend. This is good, because football will do an excellent job of trying to convince you that you are special. But you must remember that you are no different from the bartender or the electrician, who you will be friends with for life.Â </p><p>This is what will get you out of your depression. Not remembering that you are special, but remembering that you are theÂ <em>same</em>Â as everyone else. You cannot comprehend this now, at 17 years old, but I promise you that real courage is showing weakness and not being ashamed.Â </p><p>You deserve the gift of life, Gigi. Just as everyone does. Remember this.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRiylAABXRUJQVlA4ICClAABwyQO-87d8744013fa105f9a36364d92f9d48d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>Things are connected in ways that you are too young and naive to see now.

Until you have a season where you donâ€™t let in any goals, you will not be content.Â </p><p>Yes, perhaps it is true that you have always been this way.Â </p><p>Do you remember the first winter you went to visit your uncle in Udine, up in the mountains? Or is this a memory that only an older man can recall?Â </p><p>You were four years old. It had snowed overnight. You had never seen snow before. You woke up and looked out the window, and you saw a dream. This whole country turned white.Â </p><p>You ran outside in your pajamas, and you didnâ€™t even understand what snow was. But there was no hesitation. You looked at the white snowbank, and what did you do? Did you think? Did you wonder? Did you run inside for your coat?Â </p><p>No, you jumped right in. Fearless.Â </p><p>Your grandmother was screaming, â€œGianluigi!!!!!!!!!! No! No! No!â€Â </p><p>You were soaking wet, grinning.Â </p><p>You ended up having a fever for a whole week.Â </p><p>But you didnâ€™t give a damn.Â </p><p>No hesitation. Right into the snow.Â </p><p>This is who you are.Â </p><p>You are Buffon.Â </p><p>You will show the world that you exist.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-96d8aea2d17021dff79d037f75e64419.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear 16-year-old Arjen,</p><p>Itâ€™s Thursday afternoon, and momâ€™s been phoning your school.</p><p>And phoning.</p><p>And phoning.</p><p>At first, youâ€™re going to think something is wrong. Why wouldnâ€™t you? Momâ€™s never tried to get a hold of you while youâ€™re in class.</p><p>First off, donâ€™t worry. Everything is fine. In fact, youâ€™ll find out things are more than fine. But youâ€™re not going to believe what sheâ€™s going to tell you when you call her back. Youâ€™re not going to see this one coming.</p><p>When you call her back during a break between classes, everything is about to change. Very quickly.</p><p>So before you do call her back, and before everything happens, let me just say one thing that I want you to keep with you: Always play football with the hunger youâ€™ve had. Keep your drive to improve. To do more. To be the best.</p><p>Remember that, will you? For everything thatâ€™s about to happen, never forget that hunger.</p><p>â€œThe coach of Groningenâ€™s first team called earlier,â€ Mom will tell you, once you finally speak. â€œHe wants you to travel with them this weekend for the match.â€</p><p>I know, right? Incredible.</p><p>Why do I bring this up? Well, Iâ€™ve been thinking about that moment a lot lately. The moment when things really started. Another season has finished â€” your 17th, with another one coming this week. Youâ€™re 33, and youâ€™re only playing on a one-year contract, so after that, who knows?</p><p>And maybe when the end of your career becomes more and more of a reality â€¦ you start thinking about the beginning. When it stopped being just a game.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RpQRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-592a0e40da44781f07999bc6aeb48e99.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="VI Images/Getty Images"><figcaption>VI Images/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That happened when you arrived to Groningen. And Groningen will be an opportunity that will take you to PSV, and then PSV will take you to Chelsea. At 20 years old, youâ€™ll be in the Premier League.</p><p>And your boss? His name is JosÃ© Mourinho. I should prepare you. Because he will expect a lot of you â€¦ and of everyone. Right away, youâ€™ll feel the difference in playing for a Premier League club. Youâ€™ll need to be tougher, stronger, faster.</p><p>Youâ€™ll have to prove yourself all over again once you get there. And prove yourself to JosÃ© every single week to stay in the lineup. Look, a lot has been said about JosÃ©. Heâ€™s a strong personality, heâ€™s demanding. But ever since you started playing, youâ€™ve been just as demanding of yourself. In a way, itâ€™ll almost seem like a perfect match. He wants to see your very best, each and every day on the pitch. And all youâ€™ll want to give is your best. Whether in training, or in a match.</p><p>Or working your way back from an injury.</p><p>Yes, this is going to be the first time youâ€™re challenged in that way, too. Itâ€™s not how you wanted to start off in England â€¦ with a broken bone in your foot in a preseason match. Youâ€™ll be sidelined for more than two months. But that will only provide more motivation to prove yourself. To prove yourself to JosÃ©. To your teammates. To Stamford Bridge and the fans.</p><p>Youâ€™ll want to show everyone what you can do.</p><p>And you will, with a 72nd-minute goal in your very first start at Stamford Bridge in November 2004.</p><p>Itâ€™ll be right in front of the box, off your left foot.</p><p>(And by the way, your left foot? Specifically, coming in from the right wing and shooting with your left? Work on this. Practice this. Itâ€™ll come in handy more times than you can count. Trust me on this one.)</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRvb3AABXRUJQVlA4IOr3AABQawW-fab882a7a1b7c1ac6b2b8ff85891e76a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Phil Cole/Getty Images"><figcaption>Phil Cole/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™ll only be two years, but Chelsea will be an important step for you. For your manager, for dealing with injuries â€” but, also, that team will be something special. I give credit to JosÃ© on this, he knows how to create and build a team. And this team? Well, it was a good one.</p><p>Not just because you had players like Lampard and Drogba and ÄŒech and Terry on the pitch.</p><p>But because you had players like Lampard and Drogba and ÄŒech and Terry off the pitch as well.</p><p>Everyone on that team was thinking about each other. Everyone was thinking about the club. The atmosphere during that time â€¦ it was amazing. A lot of the guys who have been at the club for a while will look out for you, but there will be no one more important â€” not only for you, but for everyone â€” than John Terry.</p><p>What can a Dutch winger learn from an English center back?</p><p>Everything.</p><p>The most important thing though, is what it takes to be a captain and a leader at a club. Heâ€™ll be someone you can talk to, whether about football or anything else. Heâ€™ll be someone who gives advice, who encourages you. Learn as much from him as you can. How he gives everything for the club. How he gives everything for the team â€” from the first to the last minute. Out there, heâ€™s taking care of every team member. And he does the same off the pitch as well.</p><p>Iâ€™m not sure youâ€™ll know it then, just how much John influenced you. So really take in those moments with him. You wonâ€™t play with anyone quite like him again.</p><p>Or have an experience quite like you had at Chelsea. There were titles and cups in Holland, but at Chelsea, youâ€™ll all be part of history. The first league title in 50 years. Itâ€™s not going to feel complete at the time because youâ€™ll be injured. But enjoy that moment more than I did then. Appreciate it properly â€” because you were a part of that team, you were important and you did do your job.</p><p>And then help the team win another title the year after.</p><p>And then?</p><p>There will be the next stepâ€¦.</p><p>Real Madrid.</p><p>In England, youâ€™ll see from your very first match: The fans are living and breathing football. But in Spain, itâ€™s just â€¦ different. They donâ€™t breathe and live football, itâ€™s just â€¦ life.</p><p>But then, after two years, youâ€™re going to find out that football is also â€¦ business.</p><p>And youâ€™re not going to be happy about it.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-5a3f84911ceb8e37c2bb95bad0dbe5b0.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Denis Doyle/Getty Images"><figcaption>Denis Doyle/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>See, up until this point, everything has made sense. From being a boy playing at school and on little pitches, to Groningen, to PSV, to Chelsea, to Real Madridâ€¦. To league titles and cups and Champions League semi-finals.</p><p>All of it, it was always about moving forward, about improving, about finding a new challenge.</p><p>It was always about taking the next step. Thatâ€™s how you wanted to play your game.</p><p>But Bayern? Youâ€™ll see it as a step backward. Of course, they have the league titles and the cup titles, but for you, right now, itâ€™s about winning a Champions League, for which Bayern havenâ€™t been favorites. At Chelsea and at Real Madrid, you didnâ€™t get there, either.</p><p>And I know what youâ€™ll be be thinking when you hear about this move: <em>Now I definitely wonâ€™t get there.</em></p><p>Real Madrid was the biggest club in the world at the time. And youâ€™ll feel that, with them, youâ€™re at the top of the mountain, and anything else is a step down.</p><p>But hereâ€™s something I want you to know: You couldnâ€™t be more wrong about anything in your life.</p><p>Because coming to Bayern will be the best decision you will ever make.</p><p>Youâ€™ll be a part of something more at Bayern. Because success wonâ€™t just be on the pitch, but on all levels. Youâ€™ll see. Financially. Globally. In Germany and across Europe â€” that badge and those colors will mean something.</p><p>No one will expect you to do it, but the team will make it to the finals of the Champions League in your first year.</p><p>Youâ€™ll get knocked out early in 2011, but by the next year â€¦ it will be Bayernâ€™s moment. The 2012 Champions League final, in front of your home crowd at the Allianz Arena. Against your former club, Chelsea.</p><p>It couldnâ€™t have been written any better.</p><p>Except â€¦ and I donâ€™t know how to tell you this, but â€¦ it turns into a nightmare.</p><p>A lot will be said about that final, what you couldâ€™ve done â€¦ what you didnâ€™t do. But thereâ€™s something else that people wonâ€™t write about or see. And that was the first day back at training, a few weeks later. To be honest, you were ready to get back to training the day after the final. But maybe that time is something you all needed. Because when you do go back thereâ€™s â€¦ a feeling.</p><p>Youâ€™ve had plenty first days back in your career. And they all go the same way. Everyoneâ€™s lightly getting back into the rhythm, <em>OK, here we goâ€¦</em></p><p>But not this time. This time it was actually more than just a feeling, it was a spirit. Everybody wanted something. One thing, really.</p><p>Revenge.</p><p>And every match, whether in the Bundesliga, or a cup game or a Champions League qualifier is going to be played to right the wrong of that final. Every win, every goal is going to be about getting back there again.</p><p>And remember that left-footed shot I told you about? Think about it.</p><p>Think about it when you do reach the Champions League final that year. Think about it when, in the second half, shortly after Bayern takes the lead, Borussia Dortmund ties the game 1-1.</p><p>Think about it in the 89th minute, with hardly any time remaining.</p><p>Cut in from the right, control with your left.</p><p>And let it go.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRiJgAQBXRUJQVlA4IBZgAQAweQa-809b66ea4d3e4906ad49b56136fb991a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="sampics/Corbis/Getty Images"><figcaption>sampics/Corbis/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The eight years you have at Bayern Munich will be the proudest of your career. Three Champions League semifinals. Three finals. One Champions League trophy. Six Bundesliga titles. Four cup trophies.</p><p>But aside from the trophies, the titles, I donâ€™t think I can prepare you for how much this club will come to mean to you. Maybe even more so because you didnâ€™t expect it to.</p><p>So what else can I say?</p><p>Well, for one thing, there will be a pretty strange exit from the Champions League in 2017. Iâ€™ll just leave it at that.</p><p>But what I really want you to know is that even at 33, that hunger you have now is still here. That drive to keep getting better hasnâ€™t left yet. Looking back, I think thatâ€™s what gets us here more than anything â€” that desire, no matter what youâ€™ve already done, to keep going back out, to keep getting more from the pitch.</p><p>So Iâ€™m not sure when that moment will come â€” when that hunger will leave. I donâ€™t know whether itâ€™ll be next year or the year after, but when it does come, I believe weâ€™ll know that itâ€™ll be time to think about something else.</p><p>Maybe stepping back, maybe quitting â€¦ maybe making one little last move, to some other adventure?</p><p>Time will tell. And time goes by very, very quickly.</p><p>So for now, donâ€™t keep Mom waiting.</p><p>â€” Arjen</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-8d99327111ff5059f1a7505f508bc0b2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>(1) Do me a favor â€”Â go on and look up all the big dynasties in professional sports over these last 25 years. </strong></p><p>Michael and Scottie and the Bulls. Brady with the Patriots. Jeterâ€™s Yankees. Shaq and Kobeâ€™s Lakers. Duncanâ€™s Spurs. Stephâ€™s Warriors. LeBron and D-Wade and the Heat. All the big ones. Look them up.</p><p>O.K. â€”Â now hereâ€™s something thatâ€™s interesting about those dynasties:</p><p>They never won four in a row.</p><p>All of those teams, as great (and I mean <em>great</em>) as they wereâ€¦.. they never went back to back to back to <em>back</em>.</p><p>Now: Three in a row? Thatâ€™s been done.Â </p><p>Five, or six, or however many, over however many years? Also been done.Â </p><p>But <em>four in a row??</em></p><p>Nope.</p><p>See, four in a row â€” that would be something legendary. You figure that if a dynasty ever won <em>four straight?</em> Youâ€™d be watching movies about them. Theyâ€™d be airing TV specials and writing books about it and whatnot. You figure, <em>four in a row</em>â€¦.. thatâ€™s something truly special. Thatâ€™s <em>immortality</em> right there.</p><p>You figure.</p><p>Hereâ€™s the thing about it, though.</p><p>I won four.</p><p><em>We </em>won four.</p><p>From 1997 to 2000, the Houston Comets won <em>four consecutive WNBA championships.</em></p><p>And I wonder how many of yâ€™all reading this even know our story.</p><p>I wonder how many of yâ€™all out there actually know who I am.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SVeRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-03886efaa36068e2608a936d6f6e9047.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Fernando Medina/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Fernando Medina/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p><strong>(2) I was the Michael Jordan of womenâ€™s hoops.</strong></p><p>Thatâ€™s real!! Trust me.</p><p>Itâ€™s real and Iâ€™ll tell you why.</p><p>The similarities between me and Michael? Man, they were crazyâ€¦â€¦.</p><p>First of all, Iâ€™m the same age as Michael. Same <em>exact</em> age, no kidding. Michael was born only two months before me in 1963. And from there, if you go back and look at it, itâ€™s like we were on these kind of parallel paths. Michael was the top high school player in his state. I was the top high school player in my state. Michael could have played college hoops anywhere, but he chose to stay at home in Carolina. I could have played college hoops anywhere, but I chose to stay at home in L.A.</p><p>Michael won a national title with UNC in â€™82.Â </p><p>I won a national title with USC in â€™83 (and â€™84 â€” but whoâ€™s counting).</p><p>We both established ourselves as elite scoring guard prospects.</p><p>You see what Iâ€™m saying? Itâ€™s these parallel paths.</p><p>After that, though, our paths diverged.</p><p>Because when it came time for Michael to go pro?? Well, you know the deal. Third overall in the â€™84 Draft â€” and the rest is history.Â </p><p>By â€™98 heâ€™s the GOAT.Â </p><p>My history, on the other handâ€¦â€¦. it reads a little bit different.</p><p><strong>(3) I was one of the best young women&#39;s basketball players in America â€”Â and America had nothing for me.</strong></p><p>No professional womenâ€™s league to play for. No draft. Had to go to Europe to make any money â€” and by any money I mean <em>any</em> money. I signed with an agent, hoping to get a spot in the Italian league, but not many teams in Europe were looking for guards at the time. So the only offer I got was from this small team in Valencia, Spain.</p><p>One year for $20k â€” thatâ€™s what being one of the most promising young talents in the game got me, coming out of college: a minimum salary contract overseas.</p><p>Did it sting? <em>Yeah</em>, it stung.</p><p>But at the same time, I accepted my one-year deal for what it was: an opportunity. A â€œshow meâ€ contract. And I set out to do just that. I got my butt over to Spain and I said, <em>You know what â€” letâ€™s see what I can show this league. Letâ€™s just play it out and see what happens. Letâ€™s see what Iâ€™ve got.</em></p><p>Rookie year I think I averaged 37 points per game.</p><p>No lie, 37 per. Thatâ€™s not a misprint. I mean, Iâ€™m pretty sure I had a 67-point game somewhere in thereâ€¦.. I had a 50-point game in thereâ€¦.. I had a few <em>nights</em>. I was that L.A. bucket bucket. It was a good season, and it put me on the map with some of the teams in <em>Italia</em>.</p><p>(That means Italy, by the way. I speak fluent Italian.)</p><p><strong>(4) I ran the Italian league for about a decade.</strong></p><p>After my season in Valencia, I ended up signing with Parma â€” you know, where they make Parmigiano-Reggiano, Prosciutto di Parma and all of that?? â€” and that was big. That was prime time. Like I said, Italy was the premier league. All the great players were wanting to play in that league. Which meant two things: One, yeah, they had more money to throw around. But also, two, they werenâ€™t just handing out long-term contracts left and right. <em>Everyone</em> was fighting for those paydays, for that security. You really had to turn some heads to last in Italy for more than a minute.</p><p>And so again, Iâ€™m just like â€” man, on one hand, does it sting a little? I average <em>37</em> my first year as a pro <em>and Iâ€™m still scrapping?!</em> Yeah, it stings. But I took it on as just another opportunity.Â </p><p>Or maybe even more than an opportunity, I took it on as a challenge: <em>Do I belong here with the best of the best? Or am I about to be back in L.A. running pickup? Only one way to find out.</em></p><p>First season in Parma, I think I almost averaged 40.</p><p>Second season, I averaged 40 and won league MVP.</p><p>All total, I ended up spending 10 seasons in Spain and Italy, and won eight scoring titles.</p><p>I was runner-up the other two.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RRgRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-19c5680751838980b9c8d892b2ece735.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Cynthia Cooper-Dyke"><figcaption>Courtesy of Cynthia Cooper-Dyke</figcaption></figure><p><strong>(5) I wonâ€™t say I had mixed emotions about playing overseas â€” because I didnâ€™t.Â </strong></p><p>I <em>loved</em> my time in Europe. Those were amazing years. You really have to understand â€” Iâ€™m a kid from <em>Watts</em>. And Iâ€™d have these moments where it was just, like.â€¦.. alright hold upâ€¦... <em>how did I get here??</em> Howâ€™d I end up on this CANAL in VENICE, taking a damn BOAT from one arena to the next, for my JOB of <em>hooping??? </em>Howâ€™d I make it from the inner city to the Duomo??</p><p>That <em>still</em> blows me away. So as far as my career overseas goes, itâ€™s all love.</p><p>But love is complicated, you know what I mean??</p><p>And I think I felt some of that over the course of my run in Europe. I think there were times where maybe Iâ€™d be coming off a 50-point game or something, or Iâ€™d hit two free throws in OT with zeros on the clock for the win, or Iâ€™d dominate a big rival, and it would just kind of hit me, likeâ€¦.. <em>damn</em>, I have to admit, it would have been nice to do that with 20,000 people chanting my name. Or it would have been nice to be on SportsCenter for some highlights, or in the sports section of the L.A. Times the next morning with a write-up. Or it would have been nice to know that any of my people back home had really <em>any idea at all</em> about the levels I was reaching on this other side of the world.Â </p><p>And so I wouldnâ€™t say I felt <em>cheated</em> out of anything, necessarily â€” but I still definitely had these moments where I was aware of what I was missing out on, just by virtue of being a female player instead of a male player, and where Iâ€™d think to myself, you knowâ€¦.. <em>wouldnâ€™t that be nice.</em></p><p>Like I said, it was complicated. It was bittersweet.</p><p><strong>(6) In 1996, an American womenâ€™s professional league started up called the ABL.</strong></p><p>Finally!!!! Right???</p><p>As soon as I heard about it, I reached out to them about joining â€” and I figured my chances had to be good. Iâ€™d just spent almost a decade <em>leading the top league on the entire planet in scoring.</em>Â </p><p>They passed, though.</p><p>Yup â€” they just straight-up passed on me. Told me thanks but no thanks. Said they already had â€œenough guards.â€Â </p><p>That one hurt, I wonâ€™t lie.</p><p>But it was also a helpful reality check: I was <em>33 years old</em> by then â€” I was at the end of my prime. And I think the ABL not wanting meâ€¦.. that really forced me to get right with the idea that, as far as my playing professionally in the States was concerned? That probably was never going to happen. And as far as American hoop fans were concerned? My career was pretty much destined to go un-remembered.</p><p>It just was what it was â€” the opportunity had passed me by.</p><p>I accepted that.</p><p>And then a funny thing happened.</p><p><strong>(7) Summer of â€™96, I started hearing some whispers.</strong></p><p>Started hearing some <em>loud whispers</em>. I was still out in Italy, playing what would end up being my last season there â€” and I started hearing these rumors about â€œanother league.â€ Another <em>American womenâ€™s</em> league.</p><p>And then after a while, they started to become more than rumors.Â </p><p>Now it was: This league is real, Coop. This league is <em>happening.</em>Â </p><p>Now it was: The <em>NBA</em> is part of this.</p><p>O.K., wow.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-26eae4327033d3862ef9b634ef4978f1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Gray Mortimore/Allsport"><figcaption>Gray Mortimore/Allsport</figcaption></figure><p>So you know how I was saying before how Iâ€™d accepted that I wasnâ€™t going to play professionally in the States?? Alright well nevermind all of that. Once I heard the NBA was getting involved, it was like â€” <em>Nah thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m in.Â </em></p><p><em>Letâ€™s go.</em></p><p>I put together my stats, my film, plus a cover letter and a rÃ©sumÃ©, and I called the league office â€” my contact was this woman named Renee Brown.Â </p><p>I said, â€œHi, Renee, my name is Cynthia Cooper. Iâ€™m playing overseas right now. Playing in a city called Alcamo. Iâ€™d really love to be a member of your league. I&#39;m going to ship you off a box with my numbers, my video, et cetera, et cetera.â€</p><p>And she&#39;s like, â€œWait. Cynthia? Cynthia Cooper who plays in Italy?â€ I said, â€œThatâ€™s me, yeah.â€</p><p>And she goes, â€œGirl we&#39;ve been LOOKING for you. You&#39;re in our top eight! Where do we send the contract?â€</p><p>Now â€” on the outside, listen, Iâ€™m an adult. So Iâ€™m keeping my composure, telling her my mailing address, staying nice and calm. But on the inside? Man <em>Iâ€™m like a little kid</em> in there. Iâ€™m behaving like a child!! Iâ€™m <em>screaming. </em>Iâ€™m out of my MIND.</p><p>We finish talking logistics, and I thank her for her time. â€œNo, thank you,â€ she says.</p><p>â€œWelcome to the WNBA.â€</p><p><strong>(8) One thing Iâ€™m proud of, about my journey, is that I never got bitter.Â </strong></p><p>It was tempting to, at times, believe me â€” even during the best of times.Â </p><p>Honestly, in a lot of ways, it was even <em>more</em> tempting during the best of times.</p><p>Like take this WNBA launch in 1997. On one hand I couldnâ€™t be happier. Iâ€™d wanted something like the W to happen <em>so bad</em>. And then it happened!! So I should be ecstatic, right??? And mostly I was. But there was still that sting.</p><p>There was still that old sting, that Iâ€™d felt so many times before.</p><p>There was still that moment where Iâ€™m thinking, <em>Waitâ€¦â€¦. hold up. Yâ€™all are launching a league now?! As in: NOW now??? As in, when Iâ€™ll be 34?!? You couldnâ€™t have launched this during my prime, over these last 10 years?? While I was giving them Michael numbers in Italy?? While I had a whole career to look forward to?</em></p><p>Thereâ€™s still that sting of living out your dreams <em>on somebody elseâ€™s terms.</em></p><p>Itâ€™s a sting that I think is pretty universal for women in the world of sports, and frankly for Black women in the world, period.</p><p>But like I said: While it might have stungâ€¦.. it never made me bitter.Â </p><p>And Iâ€™m proud of that. Iâ€™m proud of how Iâ€™ve never let myself get bitter about â€” or feel entitled to â€” anything thatâ€™s come my way in this game, or in this life.Â </p><p>Iâ€™m proud of how, instead of worrying about being the oldest damn rookie that anyone had ever heard of?Â </p><p>I went ahead and was the best damn rookie that anyone had ever seen.</p><p><strong>(9) People knew, but they didnâ€™t </strong><em><strong>know</strong></em><strong>, you know?</strong></p><p>Look â€“ there were people in the W who knew I could play.</p><p>Iâ€™m not going to exaggerate here. We didnâ€™t have social media at the time, and obviously they werenâ€™t broadcasting my games on ESPN or what have you â€” but if you were paying a decent amount of attention, you probably knew who I was. Real heads knew I wasnâ€™t some scrub.</p><p>Still, though â€”Â realistically, there were two ways that most people in the States had gotten any of their womenâ€™s hoops information: One, by watching college. Or two, by watching Team USA in the â€™96 Olympics. And I wasnâ€™t on that Olympic squad... and I definitely wasnâ€™t in college. So just off that alone, I was relatively anonymous.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4R3GRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-206916ce7a00e784d8d78d08355948e1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=" Bill Baptist/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption> Bill Baptist/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And then the other thing I had going against me, if weâ€™re really keeping it honest here, is my age. Folks saw that <em>34</em> number next to my age and â€” even if they knew I could play a little bit â€” they just figured: Sheryl was the franchise player. Tina was the stud rookie. And I was the veteran brought in to help our team jell. To guide some of these younger players along. To lend a steadying hand.</p><p>Whatâ€™s ironic is â€” I actually <em>did</em> all of those things! I <em>was</em> 34. I <em>was</em> that steady vet. I did help our group jell. I did guide those young guns along.</p><p>I also just happened to do one other thing.</p><p>And I happened to do it really, really, really well.</p><p>I <em>got buckets.</em></p><p><strong>(10) As well as I was playing that first year â€” I still felt like I was having a â€œslow start.â€</strong></p><p>I mean, I was hooping.</p><p>O.K., I was more than hooping â€” people were picking me as midseason MVP of the whole league.</p><p>But in my mind I was still kind of holding something back.Â </p><p>I guess the way I looked at it was: Coach Chancellor still didnâ€™t know me. Tina was still trying to spread her wings coming out of USC. The offense was still really structured around Sheryl â€” and with Sherylâ€™s pregnancy and her being out for a while, I wanted to make sure everyone knew that I was team-first. So it was this very new, not exactly permanent situationâ€¦... and I didnâ€™t want it to seem like I was power hungry or anything. I made a point to try not to ruffle any feathers, and to just play within the flow.Â </p><p>I tried to get my buckets naturally as they came.</p><p>But Iâ€™ll never apologize for my talent. And the thing of it is, even naturally, even within the flow of the offense, even with me being Deferential Coop, by around midseason I was still averaging near 20.</p><p>And then what happened next Iâ€™ll never forget.</p><p>We were playing the Sparks at the Forum, and they whupped us pretty good. I think we lost by like 25 â€” our fourth loss in seven games. I had 17, but it might as well have been 7.</p><p>And for whatever reason, something just snapped in place that night. I realized two big things. 1. Like it or not, this <em>was</em> my team. I was our leader and our best player. And our losses were now a reflection on me in a way that I needed to learn to accept. 2. My Deferential Coop thing mightâ€™ve made sense in the beginning of the season, when we were all figuring stuff out â€” but the truth is? I had another gear in me. Man, I probably had another two or three gears in me.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SUCRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-44848922c640ed0bf34ad26542d853b2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Andrew D. Bernstein/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>And after that Sparks game, I let Coach Chancellor know it. I went right up to him in the locker room and I said, â€œCoach, straight up, I can give you more.â€Â </p><p>At first I could tell he was a little confused. He goes to me, â€œMore? What do you mean <em>more</em>? Theyâ€™re already saying youâ€™re MVP.â€ But I just held firm. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t care what theyâ€™re saying about me. I know I can give you more. If you let me go, Iâ€™m telling you, I can give you more.â€</p><p>And Coach just looks at me for a few seconds, still all quizzical, and finally he says, â€œWell..... alright, then. Alright, Cupper.â€ (He never pronounced my name right. Still doesnâ€™t to this day.)</p><p>The next two games I went for 30 (W) and 32 (W) â€” and then I gave Sacramento a 44-piece to close out the road trip. (Another W.)</p><p>And thatâ€™s about when it all changed for me. Thatâ€™s when my mentality went from not wanting to ruffle any feathers, to ruffling whatever feathers I deemed necessary in order to help our team win. Thatâ€™s when I went from being a 34-year-old rookie with a chip on her shoulder, to being a superstar player with a team on her back.</p><p>Honestly? Thatâ€™s when I became <em>Cynthia Cooper</em> again.</p><p><strong>(11) Alright, quick story time here.</strong></p><p>Itâ€™s 1998 and Iâ€™m on top of the world.</p><p>1997, the Wâ€™s first season, that was a Triple Crown year: MVP, finals MVP, championship.</p><p>And itâ€™s hard to even express the emotions I was feeling from all of that. Satisfaction. Elation. Vindication. Thankfulness. Swagger. Hunger for more.</p><p>But now itâ€™s the spring of â€™98, and weâ€™re at this gym in Italy, and thereâ€™s one emotion that I can feel coming on in particular: <em>pride.</em></p><p>O.K., actually, hold up â€” let me give you some context first. Remember the ABL? The league that had told me they had â€œenough guards,â€ didnâ€™t need me, didnâ€™t want me, <em>thanks but no thanks? </em>Turns out they might have needed me after all, because they folded after two seasons. After they folded, we absorbed some of their best players into the Wâ€¦. one of those players being their first-ever MVP, Nikki McCray.</p><p>So now like I said itâ€™s the spring of â€™98, right before our second season is about to tip, and the W has a bunch of its stars over in Italy for an exhibition game â€” promote the league and so on and so forth. Nikki is one of those stars. And of course me being the reigning MVP, Iâ€™m also one of those stars.</p><p>So anyway we play the exhibition, itâ€™s a normal exhibition atmosphere, not too serious â€” weâ€™re doing our thing. Then after the game we stick around and sign some autographs.Â </p><p>Alright now hereâ€™s what happens.</p><p>Weâ€™re signing autographs, and I get handed this basketball to sign â€” and I sign it, â€œMVP.â€Â </p><p>Nikki, just seeing my signature, she says, â€œHeyâ€¦.. maybe Iâ€™ll sign it <em>MVP</em>, too.â€Â </p><p>And I love Nikki, by the way, let me establish up front.</p><p>But yeah, she said that. <em>Maybe Iâ€™ll sign it MVP, too.</em></p><p>And I justâ€¦.. I canâ€™t even describe it to yâ€™all. I just give her this look, man. This <em>look</em>.Â </p><p>And then I shoot back and I say, â€œO.K. â€” you do that. Just donâ€™t put <em>WNBA</em> MVP on it.â€</p><p>Thatâ€™s how it was back then, I am <em>telling</em> you!! If youâ€™re judging me from that story, all I can say isâ€¦.. youâ€™re right. I had <em>10 years</em> taken from me, in the dead center of my prime, just by virtue of the W not existing yet. And I knew that at 34 (now 35), my time left in the league was limited. But as long as I <em>was</em> in the league?? I was going to make that limited time count.Â </p><p>And that was just my attitude about it. Not about attention, or publicity, or endorsements or any of those things. But about greatness? About winning?</p><p>Once I found my gear â€” <em>whew</em> boy. I was an apex predator.</p><p>And like I said: I was <em>proud</em>.</p><p><strong>(12) Letâ€™s talk about The Dynasty now.</strong></p><p>Iâ€™ll keep it straightforward for yâ€™all.Â </p><p>Hereâ€™s what you need to know about the greatest basketball team of all time â€” the 1997â€“2000 Houston Comets.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD7QMgUG-7f883f2ea9a07f2039e75d4125164a18.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Barry Gossage/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h3>THE RÃ‰SUMÃ‰:</h3><p>Four years. Four rings.</p><h3>THE MAIN CHARACTERS:</h3><p><u>Van Chancellor</u></p><p>Coach was a <em>playerâ€™s coach</em>, if you know what I mean. Wasnâ€™t exactly about drawing up the old Xâ€™s and Oâ€™s. Wasnâ€™t about these big long practices, either. But he was a gentleman through and through â€” a brilliant manager of people.</p><p><u>Janeth Arcain</u></p><p>So famous that she only went by Janeth.</p><p><u>Tina Thompson</u></p><p>The young gunner. Tina had that unique ability to line up at the four and the five â€” to be very, very physical and play against the Lisa Leslies of the world â€” while also having the finesse to step out and knock down threes with NBA range. I know a lot of W players do that now, but please recognizeâ€¦. at the time, that was unique to Tina. Every stretch big since then is just following the Tina Thompson blueprint. And let me say one more thing about TT: thereâ€™s not another kid Iâ€™ve EVER met who, <em>fresh out of college</em>, could have handled what we asked of Tina during that very first run. The fact that she went on to become an all-time player, I mean, that didnâ€™t shock me at all. Tina was different from the jump.</p><p><u>Kim Perrot</u></p><p>You know something? Iâ€™ll just leave it at this: She was my best friend.</p><p><u>Sheryl Swoopes</u>Â </p><p>She had her own shoe!! Itâ€™s hard to explain how big of a deal that was. Manâ€¦. itâ€™s hard to explain how big of a deal <em>Sheryl</em> was. And thatâ€™s not even the first thing that comes to mind when I think of her. First thing that comes to mind is â€” well, I call it a miracle: the way that Sheryl came back after having a baby, let me repeat, <em>after having a baby,</em> to help us win that first championship. I think itâ€™s cute how other athletes still go on thinking theyâ€™ve done something special, after Sheryl did that.</p><h3>THE EXPERT ANALYSIS:</h3><p>Hereâ€™s how I look at it.</p><p>There are other W teams that have been truly great â€”Â there are other W teams that have won two, three, even four championships.Â </p><p>But <em>none of them</em> won a chip while we were around.</p><p>No one else won a damn thing while the Comets were on.</p><p><strong>(13) And now this is the part that it really pains me to write about.</strong></p><p>This is where we have to discuss the fact that the Houston Comets donâ€™t exist anymore.</p><p>I remember it was such a <em>normal day</em> when I found out. You know those days?? Where itâ€™s so normal you almost canâ€™t even remember what you were doing? It was like that. I was at home, Iâ€™m pretty sure. And then all of a sudden my phone started blowing up. Had people calling me, texting me, <em>Coop, you alright?!</em> â€” people hitting me up every which way. Friends, teammates, mediaâ€¦... everyone.Â </p><p>And the first person I actually spoke to, I think it was one of our local reporters here in Houston, a guy named Mark Berman. I called him back. And he was like, â€œCoop, what do you think about the Comets folding?â€</p><p>I said, â€œWhat â€” Iâ€™m sorry, <em>what??</em>â€Â </p><p>I was in a state of shock.</p><p>And itâ€™s not like he had to explain it to me, either. I knew all about the realities of this business. I knew all about the history of womenâ€™s sports franchises folding. I know money makes the world go round.</p><p>But that didnâ€™t mean it shocked me any less.</p><p>And I guess I also always believed in my heart that there were some things more important than money. I guess I always felt like, O.K., with all due respect, there are different levels of franchises. There are different types of situations. Like if you need to move the San Antonio team to Vegas, because thatâ€™s financially viable?? I donâ€™t love it, and I feel for those fans in San Antonioâ€¦.. but maybe I can understand it. Maybe I can learn to see a move like that as a cost of doing business.</p><p>But youâ€™re going to FOLD â€” <em>fold</em> â€” the HOUSTON COMETS??!?!?!??Â </p><p>Youâ€™re going to fold the franchise that won your leagueâ€™s <em>first four championships?????</em></p><p>Like, to me, when you do something like that, itâ€™s beyond dollars and cents. A franchise like the Comets, thatâ€™s <em>history</em> â€” and not just my own history, or the WNBAâ€™s history, or anything like that. The Cometsâ€¦.. thatâ€™s <em>sports</em> history. Itâ€™s <em>womenâ€™s</em> history. Itâ€™s <em>Black</em> history.</p><p>And I think itâ€™s dangerous to treat our history like that.</p><blockquote>A franchise like the Comets, thatâ€™s history â€¦.. thatâ€™s sports history. Itâ€™s womenâ€™s history. Itâ€™s Black history.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>After I got off the phone with Berman, I spoke with Tina and Sheryl â€” and it was just surreal. It was like weâ€™d lost this part of us. It was likeâ€¦.. I mean, you have to understand something.Â </p><p>You have to understand how it all comes back to pride.Â </p><p>You have to understand how <em>proud</em> we were of what we accomplished together, winning the Wâ€™s first four chips. Proud for ourselves? I mean, yeah, sure, on some level â€” we were proud of what weâ€™d built for ourselves, and for our team. But it was so much more than that.</p><p>We were proud of what weâ€™d built for the Comets as a <em>franchise.</em>Â </p><p>We were proud of what weâ€™d built for Houston as a <em>city.</em>Â </p><p>We were proud of how, as far as history was concerned, the Comets were now the WNBA Celtics. Or they were the WNBA Lakers. Or they were the WNBA Bulls, or Spurs, or â€” you pick.Â </p><p>The Comets were a living, breathing part of <em>what happened.</em></p><p>1997.Â </p><p>1998.Â </p><p>1999.Â </p><p>2000.</p><p>For four years we stitched ourselves into the fabric of this league.</p><p>And in one press release they ripped us right out.</p><p><strong>(14) Before I finish, letâ€™s talk about these GOAT conversations for a second.</strong></p><p>Because I think theyâ€™re pretty interesting.</p><p>To me, whatâ€™s been going on over this last year with Michael, Kobe and LeBron, itâ€™s beautiful. Just with how we had <em>The Last Dance</em> earlier in the year, and everyone reminiscing about all of Michaelâ€™s accomplishments, and how he capped it off with that final ring. And then we had 8/24 Day in the summer, and I was so moved by everyone sharing all their stories about Kobe, sharing their memories of what made him such an assassin, such a model of toughness, such an amazing champion. And then of course you had everything that transpired in the bubble, toward the end of the year, with LeBron winning his FOURTH ring â€” on his third team! â€” and being named Finals MVP.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s been so beautiful to me.Â </p><p>Those three momentsâ€¦.... I feel like theyâ€™ve combined to create something very special. And I feel like theyâ€™ve almost been this <em>reminder</em>, in some type of way, of the kinds of conversations we actually <em>should</em> be having, when weâ€™re talking about things like â€œthe GOATâ€ â€”Â when weâ€™re talking about players at the level of LeBron, or Kobe, or Michael, or Magic Johnson or Bill Russell or whoever else.</p><p>I feel like itâ€™s been this <em>reminder</em> of how â€” itâ€™s not about there being <em>one GOAT to rule them all</em>, you know what Iâ€™m saying? Itâ€™s not about there being one GOAT and we have to choose.Â </p><p>Ainâ€™t never been about that.</p><p>Itâ€™s more about there being a whole <em>lineage </em>of GOATs.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s how I look at it.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-16c2273211ec1b9cfffa765358c88928.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Nathaniel S. Butler/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So, for me? Itâ€™s like â€” man, <em>of course</em> LeBron is the GOAT. Look at that manâ€™s career!! Look at all that heâ€™s been able to accomplish.</p><p>I felt the same way about Michael in his time, and Kobe in his time.</p><p>Itâ€™s a <em>lineage</em>.</p><p>And just like the mantle is now being passed on to LeBron, eventually LeBron will pass the mantle on to some player who comes after him. And by then, as a matter of fact â€” weâ€™ll probably be watching some documentary about <em>LeBronâ€™s</em> â€œlast dance.â€</p><p>That makes me so happy. I love that about this game.</p><p>But if Iâ€™m being honest?</p><p>I also wish we were seeing some more of that on the womenâ€™s side.</p><p>Because I take <em>nothing</em> away from Diana. I take nothing away from her ever. Everything LBJ has done for his generation in menâ€™s basketball, DT has done for hers in womenâ€™s.</p><p>Iâ€™m the first in line to call Diana Taurasi the GOAT.</p><p>But itâ€™s still a little disappointing to me, I guess, how with Diana â€” everyone just started doing it almost <em>out of thin air</em>. You know what Iâ€™m saying??</p><p>I hope that makes sense.</p><p>Again: Dianaâ€™s earned it. She is that great. She <em>is</em> that GOAT. But itâ€™s just never felt like anyone has cared enough to trace a <em>lineage</em> to Diana as GOAT â€” to show any context for it, or to have any fun with it, or to nurture any healthy debate about it. Itâ€™s almost felt like, for most people in the media and whatnot, womenâ€™s basketball has only recently started to <em>exist</em>.</p><p>I havenâ€™t seen a <em>Diana vs. Sheryl</em> conversation, or <em>Diana vs. Lisa</em>, or <em>Diana vs. Tamika</em>.</p><p>Or yeah, Iâ€™ll say it: <em>Diana vs. Cynthia.</em></p><p>I havenâ€™t seen much understanding of what it <em>means</em> to call Diana the GOAT.</p><p>And I know itâ€™s not that serious â€” I know itâ€™s not that deep.Â </p><p>I know itâ€™s just <em>talk</em>.</p><p>But I also think itâ€™s too bad. Because in a lot of ways, that talk, those conversationsâ€¦.. theyâ€™re really what make a title like GOAT mean something in the first place.Â </p><p>Womenâ€™s basketball deserves to have those conversations.</p><p>Womenâ€™s basketball deserves a history.</p><p><strong>(15) I still wonder a lot about what my place is in this game.</strong></p><p><em>Am I one of the greatsâ€¦.. or was I just a table-setter for greatness to come?</em></p><p><em>Did my career matterâ€¦.. or am I fading away?</em></p><p><em>Will the name â€œCynthia Cooperâ€ mean something five years from now? Ten years from now? Twenty years from now? Fifty years from now?</em></p><p><em>Does it even mean something NOW?</em></p><p>Itâ€™s probably not healthy for me, but I donâ€™t know â€” I canâ€™t really help but ask myself these types of questions. I canâ€™t really help but wonder.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4AAQSkZJRgABAQEBLAEsAAD7QMoUG-3b6882a7bd30f9128cd6b7c83332a875.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Fernando Medina/NBAE via Getty Images"><figcaption>Fernando Medina/NBAE via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Thereâ€™s a part of me, Iâ€™ll be honest, that stays a little bit heartbroken sometimes: When I think of my decade in Europe that people probably donâ€™t remember.

        <![CDATA[<p>At the Universal CityWalk in Orlando, there used to be an NBA store. It might as well have been heaven when I was six years old. There was a LeBron statue out front. It was huge. On the inside there were rows and rows of NBA jerseys, and balls stacked from the floor to the ceiling â€” and I wanted to touch them all. I remember just going from aisle to aisle, grabbing each jersey and turning it around to see the name on the back.</p><p>JAMES </p><p>BRYANT</p><p>NOWITZKI</p><p>Iâ€™d call my dad over to show him my favorite ones. I could have spent all day there. That place was special because we didnâ€™t have anything like it back home in France. My parents and I came to America every summer during my dadâ€™s off-season. He played pro basketball for Cholet, just outside of Nantes. When his season would end weâ€™d head back to where Dad grew up, in the Central Florida area, and Iâ€™d get to live for a few months as an American kid. </p><p>I was born in Florida, yes, but I was raised in France. </p><p>In Cholet, the NBA felt like it was a million miles away. </p><p>Every day, when I got out of elementary school, Mum would come pick me up at four oâ€™clock and take me home. Iâ€™d rush through my homework and then wait until nobody was using our family computer, and then Iâ€™d get on the Internet. Thatâ€™s how I used to learn about the NBA. On YouTube, Iâ€™d watch hours and hours of And1 mixtapes and highlight videos of my guys, like Dwyane Wade and Bron. If I could go back and check my Internet history from back then, Iâ€™m sure it would be just pages and pages of links like, â€œBEST CROSSOVERS 2008/09â€ and â€œJUMPER COMPILATION NBA.â€</p><p>I rarely, if ever, saw a full game. So to me, those players were literal human highlight reels who were capable of doing anything on the court. </p><p>Thatâ€™s why, when we walked into the NBA store in Orlando, seeing their jerseys was like touching Supermanâ€™s cape, or something like that.</p><p>My favorite part, though, was the hand imprints they had on the wall. They had Kobe and Bron on there, but the wildest one was Shaq â€” no doubt. I think I could have fit five of my hands inside his palm. He was a big deal in Orlando, too, of course. There were pictures of him all over the store, and his jersey was everywhere. </p><p>NBA basketball made me proud to have been born there. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-4e27fcb3035c565d023d8cac3d6e94aa.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Killian Hayes"><figcaption>Courtesy of Killian Hayes</figcaption></figure><p>Because I had been born in the States, and my dad was from there, I felt like I was a part of American basketball. Like I was closer to it than all the kids I played with back in France. Even as a seven- or eight-year-old boy, I was always proud to introduce myself in class as Killian Hayes, from Lakeland, Florida. </p><p>Cholet isnâ€™t that big of a place. My elementary school was near our house, and most of the kids lived in the same neighborhood. When I wasnâ€™t watching NBA highlights after school, Iâ€™d be out at the field playing soccer with my friends. I never played on any organized teams â€” because once I put my hand inside Shaqâ€™s, I knew I wanted to play basketball forever â€” but everyone in town played soccer, so thatâ€™s what I did. And in class, all the kids would talk about Ronaldo and Messi, not Bron and Kobe. </p><p>But one thing I want to make clear is this: France is absolutely a basketball country, too. </p><p>We might not have the international pedigree of other European countries, and certainly not the U.S., but there is a great basketball culture in France. </p><p>I learned that from going to my dadâ€™s games in Cholet. </p><p>The atmosphere at those games was more like a Champions League soccer match than it was an NBA game. The crowds were loud, and they were smart. They respected the crisp, dagger bounce pass just as much as they loved the dunk.</p><blockquote>The atmosphere at those games was more like a Champions League soccer match than it was an NBA game.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>When Mum was busy, Iâ€™d go to my dadâ€™s practices from time to time after school, and I learned a lot there. Dad would lower the hoop for me and pick me up and let me dunk. As I got a bit older, heâ€™d run me through drills. Heâ€™s a big guy, 6 &#39;6&#34; and 230 pounds. So for a long time he was pretty stiff competition. I couldnâ€™t post him up until a few years ago. </p><p>He pushed me hard, but he never forced me to play basketball. </p><p>Dad had played college ball in the States, and I knew his journey hadnâ€™t been straightforward. He never made it to the league and he had to grind really hard in Europe to make a name for himself. He knows the game of basketball â€” and the world of basketball â€” more than most people. </p><p>I think he knew that if I wanted to do this, like if I <em>really </em>wanted to try to be a basketball player, then I had to love it. I had to love coming to the gym each day. I had to love the process. And when I got to be 11 or 12 years old, he saw that in me. I was a determined boy. When Iâ€™d come back to America in the summers, and weâ€™d go down to the rec center and Iâ€™d play against some really good players who were older than me, thatâ€™s when I knew I could play this game. </p><p>My dream wasnâ€™t just to play basketball forever. </p><p>All those YouTube videos and trips to the CityWalk had left a mark on me.</p><p>My dream was to play in the NBA. </p><p>But the road from Cholet to the NBA draft was hard to navigate. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-fa36fd1d2781a02e27a4dcfe889da491.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Killian Hayes"><figcaption>Courtesy of Killian Hayes</figcaption></figure><p>When I was 14, my dad was considering coming back to Florida to try to play professionally. So we also talked about me going to one of the big high schools in the States to get myself ready for college ball. </p><p>And I wanted that, real bad. I had seen so many videos online of the McDonaldâ€™s All American games and the big AAU tournaments and all those different youth basketball events. There was so much hype, and all those guys were choosing between different colleges to go to â€” it just seemed like the dream. But my parents and I did a lot of talking about the best route to take going forward, and it didnâ€™t include going to America. </p><p>A part of me was a bit disappointed when we came to the decision, but I understood. I trusted my dad and his experience with the high school and college system in America. Itâ€™s not that itâ€™s bad or canâ€™t produce great players â€” lots of superstar players go through it â€” but he just felt that for me, the most important thing was to learn how to be a great <em>pro</em>. </p><p>Heâ€™d say, â€œAll the five-star ratings, all the hype videos â€” they donâ€™t mean anything if you get to the NBA and canâ€™t make it work as a professional basketball player.â€</p><p>But at the end of the day, the decision was still mine. And with all of the options laid out in front of me, I decided to stay in France and become a professional player at Cholet. </p><p>I played my first game as a pro at 16 years old. Most kids that age are juniors in high school, but there I was going up against grown men â€” playing for their livelihoods, in games that truly mattered to the clubs. The teams in France rely on the prize money for making the playoffs and the gate proceeds to stick around, so each game really matters. It made me see the game a bit differently. </p><p>There wasnâ€™t time to make mistakes, there wasnâ€™t time to play like a rookie. </p><blockquote>There wasnâ€™t time to make mistakes, there wasnâ€™t time to play like a rookie.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>When Iâ€™d hold on to the ball for too long, or try to make a play on my own, the coach would always yell at me. I had grown up being one of the better players on my junior teams, and Iâ€™d gotten used to forcing plays from time to time because I knew I had the ability to do it. But at the pro level, I couldnâ€™t do that. </p><p>Being on edge like that ... it made me uncomfortable. But I learned quickly that the best way to grow was to <em>be</em> uncomfortable. I got better as a player because I had to, because there was no other choice. I knew I wouldnâ€™t play much if I couldnâ€™t get into the lineup. My dad knew that, and I also think he knew that I would rise to the challenge. </p><p>I had to mature quickly. No time to complain about playing time, or who gets the ball when. We were in the business of winning games. That was what mattered.Â </p><p>My older teammates helped me out, on and off the court. I couldnâ€™t get my drivers license in France until I was 18, so my first few years with Cholet my parents and teammates used to have to drive me to and from practices and games. People always offered to help because they knew I cared so much about Cholet. I had been going to the arena since before I can remember. I knew the club really well. Itâ€™s one big family. </p><p>When I think of Cholet, I think of guys like Abdoulaye Ndoye and Warren Woghiren â€” who started their pro careers around the same time I did. They helped me so much in the weight room and on the court, and also helped me grow as a player and a professional. They showed me that I could do this, that I could be a pro. That was when the NBA changed for me from a dream to an objective. </p><p>That might sound the same to you, but itâ€™s not. A dream is something that you imagine, something you donâ€™t expect to happen. An objective is something you cross off a list â€” something you <em>know</em> you can do. </p><p>You just gotta go do it. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4R4VRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAATAAABA-99432cfb65d8d7a53a90a66e55f07373.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="TF-Images/Getty Images"><figcaption>TF-Images/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So in 2019, I took the next step in my career and decided to move away from home. I went to Germany to play for ratiopharm Ulm in the Basketball Bundesliga. It was a chance to test my game even more, to make myself more uncomfortable. We played in the EuroCup against some of the best teams from all over the continent. It was an incredible experience, a chance to see the game in different parts of the world â€” it was just really rewarding. </p><p>I used to watch March Madness highlights as a boy. The sold-out football stadiums going crazy for Duke and North Carolina â€¦ I thought it was just the coolest thing ever. Thatâ€™s why the decision to stay in Europe was tough. I wanted that college experience. But if I could go back in time and tell myself to have confidence in the choice, to keep the faith, I would talk about the places the game can take you. </p><p>I was 18 years old and playing pro basketball in Germany. I was travelling to Italy, Spain and all these other places to play a <em>game</em>. I learned more than I ever could have imagined and I have zero regrets about the path I was fortunate enough to take.</p><p>All of those experiences have prepared me for whatâ€™s next. </p><p>Iâ€™m ready to cross an objective off my list. </p><p>Iâ€™m ready to be a professional basketball player in the NBA. </p><p>Everything Iâ€™ve done in my life has been leading to this moment. </p><blockquote>Everything Iâ€™ve done in my life has been leading to this moment. <cite></cite></blockquote><p>Itâ€™s funny, I got a DM from Tony Parker the other day on Instagram. He was just saying hello and that he wanted to talk sometime, give me some advice. Heâ€™s obviously a legend and I was shocked to see it. But it made me realize something â€” or at least it made me think about something I used to dream about. </p><p>During all the interviews with the NBA teams before the draft, they would ask me about what type of player I wanted to be. I told them the truth â€” about the dream that had been with me since I was a little kid: I want to be a great pro, just like my dad taught me to be. I want to be a teammate who guys in the room can rely on. And I want to be a leader on the court.</p><p>But I also told them that I am incredibly proud of where I was raised. </p><p>I want to be one of the best players to come out of France, just like Tony. </p><p>Right now, itâ€™s a dream, too. But I know I can turn it into an objective. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACFUAAASw-d75fef05e8de692a968b2af6037dc66c.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>To the city of Indianapolis, and to Pacers fans everywhereâ€¦..Â </p><p>Thank you so much for the warm welcome, for real. I read ALL of your messages last night â€” yâ€™all being excited has me excited.</p><p>Itâ€™s been a pretty wild journey for me to get to this pointâ€¦. and it kind of feels like one chapter is coming to a close now, while this other one is just beginning. And so I thought it might be a cool idea to write a few things down â€” just to mark the moment, in a way, and show my gratitude.Â </p><p>And maybe to help you get to know your 2020 Draft Pick a little bit.</p><p>Hereâ€™s a few thoughts on where Iâ€™m at, and what Iâ€™m about:</p><h3><strong>(1) I love sports.Â </strong></h3><p>No, I donâ€™t think you understand: I <em>love</em> sports. Iâ€™m obsessed with sports. Likeâ€¦.. Iâ€™m not one of these dudes who just had a growth spurt, realized he was 6&#39; 6&#34; or whatever, and then decided to give hooping a try.</p><p>Iâ€™m here, first and foremost, because basketball is what I live and breathe.</p><h3><strong>(2) One play Iâ€™m always proud of, that I think reflects who I am as a player, was in my junior year of high school â€” state semifinals.</strong></h3><p>So weâ€™re one game away from the California state championship, and weâ€™re down late. Itâ€™s all coming down to the final play. And letâ€™s be honest: a lot of people here are probably expecting me to tell a story about how I hit some game-winning shot.Â </p><p>But thatâ€™s not the case.</p><p>Nah. See, we had me on our team, and I was one of our leaders for sure â€” but we also had this guy Duane Washington, whoâ€™s a really good player (heâ€™s at Ohio State now). And my mentality in that moment was, listen: Iâ€™m always ready to take the big shot. But my <em>top</em> priority? Itâ€™s to make the winning play. And the way we figured it, drawing it up, with my athleticism and being able to see over the defense and whatnot, we were going to run a play with me as the full-court inbound passer, and my role was to hit Duane in the perfect spot for him to get in space for a bucket.</p><p>Basically the Grant Hill to Christian Laettner Play, right?? But I actually think ours was harder, because Duane was double-teamed. And I had to basically drop a dime, right in his hands, over two defenders. (You know what, maybe it was more like Kyler to D-Hop.) Anyway â€” I hit that pass, Duane hit his shot, we tied it up, won in 2OT, and went on to a state title.</p><blockquote>Iâ€™m always ready to take the big shot. But my top priority? Itâ€™s to make the winning play.<cite></cite></blockquote><h3><strong>(3) I know my history.Â </strong></h3><p>If you think Iâ€™m too young to be referencing Grant Hill to Christian Laettner â€” youâ€™re right. That play happened seven years before I was born. But at the same time, a classic like that, itâ€™s kind of a good way for me to show you what Iâ€™m about. Because Iâ€™m all about respecting the classics. Iâ€™m all about learning from my OGs.</p><p>I grew up being the type of kid whose idea of a fun night could easily just be watching the replay of an old NBA game â€” and Iâ€™m still that way. The other night, I was watching some random Bulls vs. Hawks matchup from the late 1980sâ€¦. and it blew me away. Of course, real heads, they already know why: late â€™80s Bulls vs. Hawks meansÂ <em>Michael vs. Dominique.</em></p><p>It was unbelievable. Those dudes were at the absolute peak of their powers, and they just <em>went at it,</em> tip to buzzer.</p><p>It was like the type of battles youâ€™d have with your friends in the driveway, growing up â€” when itâ€™s first to 21, youâ€™re going shot for shot, and itâ€™s WAR. Only this was on that NBA stage. Levels and levels to greatness.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-9ffcf575f866a965de5677deea2af059.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Walter Iooss Jr./Sports Illustrated via Getty Images"><figcaption>Walter Iooss Jr./Sports Illustrated via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>(4) Actually, while Iâ€™ve got this platform, I have a hot take for you all.Â </strong></h3><p><em>Last Dance</em> era Mike? He was nice. I mean, he was more than nice â€” late-â€™90s Mike is about as iconic as it gets. But still Iâ€™ll tell you what: late-<em>â€™80s </em>MJ?? Young, wiry Mike?? That might be my favorite version of the man. That might be the GOATâ€™s GOAT era.</p><p>Itâ€™s <em>crazy</em>, the stuff that Michael was pulling off. One thing I noticed is how efficient he was with the ball. Sometimes it would be two dribbles to his spot and then elevation. Or it would be three dribbles, direct to the rim. Maybe one quick in-and-out, or one crossover, max â€” but even those moves, every time, you could tell he was setting up his finish.</p><blockquote>Late-â€™80s MJ?? Young, wiry Mike?? That might be my favorite version of the man.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>And thatâ€™s been a really big lesson for me, from watching Michael in his younger years, that Iâ€™m trying to emulate: A lot of people, they see one scouting report on you, and they write you off as all flash. â€œJust an athlete.â€ But I think Iâ€™m going to be able to show people that athleticism like I have can be a weapon in surprising ways. It can be something that helps with efficiency on both ends of the court.</p><h3><strong>(5) Thereâ€™s this rumor going around that I started dunking in ninth grade â€” but itâ€™s not true.</strong></h3><p>I started dunking in sixth grade.Â </p><p>Well, <em>technically</em> it was the summer before seventh grade. A couple of days before orientation.Â </p><p>I think it was a situation where, like, they needed a few volunteers to pop into school that day to help set things up. So I was hanging around the gym doing my volunteer thing, Iâ€™m in my Sierra Canyon â€œuniformâ€ â€” collared shirt + khaki shorts (no board shorts) + Vans â€” and of course you know thereâ€™s a ball out. And itâ€™s a bunch of us just messing around.</p><p>O.K. so backtrack for one second: I had this <em>thing</em>, I donâ€™t even know how or why it started, where I was just like â€” one of my big goals was to dunk before I started middle school. I wanted that so bad. So for all of sixth grade, and the summer before seventh grade, that had been one of the main things Iâ€™d get up to. Trying and trying to dunk. But pretty much all my tries up to that point were ending the same: <em>clank</em>, in and out, almost like an invisible hand was stuffing me at the rim. Like I was a few inches short, but I might as well have been a few feet short. It was a struggle.</p><p>Until it wasnâ€™t.Â </p><p>I have no idea what was different about that day. Maybe I grew overnight, or I had a little extra cereal for breakfast, orâ€¦.. I donâ€™t know. All I know is, it was this bunch of us in the gym hanging out, I picked up the ball and I hit my stride, and then â€” <em>BAM.</em></p><p>O.K. â€” so it wasnâ€™t Zach LaVine in the Dunk Contest or anything. But in my head?? In my head it was like a 97, easy. Maybe a 98. In my head it was <em>clean</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-c266b9cca6a66deb7b7c53d13f7ce5d2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Cassius Stanley"><figcaption>Courtesy of Cassius Stanley</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™s funny, people are always asking me for advice on how to dunk better. Or jump higher. How to add those inches to their vertical. And itâ€™s just likeâ€¦.. have you ever been in a math class, and the teacher is writing some complex equation on the board, and your brain&#39;s going,Â <em>Excuse me? WHAT?? </em>Like you know you did the homework and everything, and youâ€™re not bad at math, but, <em>nah.</em> No way. That thing on the board canâ€™t be real. It makes zero sense. And then you turn to your right and the kid at the next deskâ€¦.. he hasnâ€™t just already finished it. Heâ€™s obliterated it. And youâ€™re like, â€œBro â€” howâ€™d you <em>do</em> that?? Howâ€™d you solve that equation??â€ And he tells you, like, â€œI canâ€™t really explain it. Honestly I just kind of <em>did it,</em> you know? It was easy.â€</p><p>Alright well thatâ€™s like me and dunking. For most people, with dunking, itâ€™s like they see a bunch of confusing numbers on the board and it will never make sense.</p><p>For me? Itâ€™s easy.</p><p>I just kind of obliterate it.</p><p>I just <em>dunk.</em></p><h3><strong>(6) Oh yeah and then one other funny thing about that.</strong></h3><p>My mom is an insane athlete. Actually, check that â€” she was a <em>heptathlete</em>. For those who donâ€™t know the heptathlon, itâ€™s seven events: hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200m sprint, long jump, javelin, and 800m run. Itâ€™s beyond legit. And like I said, my mom was insane. She was an All-America at UCLA, and competed at a world-class level. Itâ€™s wild. My mom was a legend in the game.</p><p>And then my dad is a sports agent. And I love my dad to death â€” I could spend hours bragging about him, and heâ€™s a legend in his own game, for sure. But I wonâ€™t lie: He couldnâ€™t jump over a piece of paper.</p><p>So itâ€™s just kind of hilarious, because, likeâ€¦.. it doesnâ€™t take a genius to see that I got my jumping ability, and my athleticism in general, from my mom. But for whatever reason, I think because people have all of these gender biases, itâ€™s like they canâ€™t wrap their heads around that. So people are always looking at my dad â€” who is about 6&#39; 1&#34; and dresses like a DAD, if you know what I mean â€” and theyâ€™re always like, â€œHuh. So, what, did your dadâ€¦.. he play in the league? Or he play college ball? Orâ€¦..â€ And itâ€™s like, ha. No!! Canâ€™t jump, canâ€™t hoop. Thanks for asking.</p><p>Meanwhile, my mom was on the damn ALL AMERICA squad â€” and no one ever asks me a thing.</p><p>Check your bias, people!!!!!</p><p>And Mom, thanks for the hops.</p><h3><strong>(7) Iâ€™m proud of my Los Angeles roots.</strong></h3><p>I think at this point in our history, the proof is just in the names.Â </p><p>The LA-area roll call is <em>deep</em>: Russ. Harden. DeMar. Taurasi. Lonzo. The Holiday Bros. Jordin Canada. Zach LaVine. Paul George. OGs like Baron. Cheryl and Reggie. Tyson Chandler. Lisa Leslie. Paul Pierce. Cynthia Cooper. Gil. Nick Young. And then you have new blood like myself, Onyeka, LaMelo, and it goes on. Plus plenty of talent coming up behind us, in the high school and college ranks. (Shoutout to my guy Josh Christopher over at Arizona State. Remember the name.)</p><p>And whether itâ€™s training together, or crossing paths and building relationships in Drew League, or helping out the generation behind you, the bonds that stay holding LA basketball together are real. For example, and I wonâ€™t speak on this too much because I know he doesnâ€™t do it for the attention, but, manâ€¦.. would I be in the spot Iâ€™m in right now, having just gotten drafted to the league, if Russ hadnâ€™t taken me under his wing? If he hadnâ€™t gone out of his way to mentor me, and train with me, and look out for me? I donâ€™t know.</p><p>And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so grateful, and so proud to be a part of this lineage.Â </p><p>And itâ€™s why I expect a lot out of myself â€” both to pay it forward when itâ€™s my turn, and to play a type of basketball that might make me worthy of waving the flag for our city.</p><h3><strong>(8) Probably the thing thatâ€™s helped me most to get through this Draft process â€” itâ€™s a piece of advice I got from Coach K.Â </strong></h3><p>What happened wasâ€¦.. well, itâ€™s interesting.</p><p>After I jumped 44 inches at the combine, thatâ€™s a number thatâ€™s kind of stuck with me.Â </p><p>Everyone wants to bring it up. First thing Iâ€™ll get questions on in any interview. <em>Third-highest combine number since 2000,</em> and so on. And I think for a lot of people, a number like that, it can kind of be this albatross. They canâ€™t get free of that number, and then it sort of messes with their head. It can become this way to almost marginalize them: <em>Youâ€™re just a jumper, </em>or <em>Youâ€™re a one dimensional player,</em> or stuff like that.</p><p>But <em>hereâ€™s</em> why you go to Duke, man.</p><p>Hereâ€™s why you go to Duke: <em>I already went through this once.</em> Kind of insane, but itâ€™s true. Early on last fall at Duke, before Media Day in the preseason, I guess people found out that Iâ€™d broken Zionâ€™s maximum vertical record. I jumped 46 inches as a freshman. And everyoneâ€™s going <em>crazy</em> about it, right? So of course with Media Day coming, itâ€™s all anyone is going to ask me about.</p><p>Coach K, though, knowing that, and knowing I think how it could potentially have these negative effects on me, he took me aside. And the line Iâ€™ll never forget that he said to me is, he just goes â€” â€œCassius, thatâ€™s not an <em>empty</em> number.â€ And basically what Coach meant by that is, â€œ46â€.... thatâ€™s not some piece of trivia. Thatâ€™s not some show number. Itâ€™s not a â€œ12 guys in the gym and youâ€™re touching a stickâ€ number. Thatâ€™s a <em>real</em> number. Itâ€™s a <em>productive</em> number. â€œ46â€ means you can rebound like hell from the guard spot, when the other team thinks youâ€™re boxed out. â€œ46â€ means you can close out on a shooter that much faster, that much higher, that much <em>more</em>. â€œ46â€ means that where other guys are taking low-percentage floaters and tough-angle layups, youâ€™re playing above the rim at a high percentage. Youâ€™re playing the attack angles. Youâ€™re playing to win.</p><p>In other words: â€œ46,â€ â€œ44,â€ those arenâ€™t workout numbers â€” theyâ€™re <em>basketball</em> numbers.</p><p>And I donâ€™t jump to jump.</p><p>I jump to win basketball games.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD7V28UG-67c5304ca5d25890c31b51fd26836c18.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Grant Halverson/Getty Images"><figcaption>Grant Halverson/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>(9) LETâ€™S GO, INDY.</strong></h3><p>Like I said at the top â€” this is an ending for me, but itâ€™s also a beginning.

I canâ€™t even tell you how excited I am to become a part of this community, and to earn my spot on this Pacers roster.</p><p>And as soon as I started hearing from yâ€™all fans last nightâ€¦.. I knew I was in the right place.</p><p>I think thatâ€™s a good note to end this on.</p><p>Thanks for reading â€” and thanks for the opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>Iâ€™m here to work and Iâ€™m here to win.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-e3061b99e46cac9e00b24d1c398daab7.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear 29-year-old Mike,</p><p>I got to let you know something before you go out there for triple overtime in Buffalo.</p><p>I know, I know, youâ€™ve got to be out on the ice with your guys. But youâ€™re going to want to hear this. Because youâ€™re about to go through one of the most amazing, important times in your life. And when it ends, those memories are going to last forever.</p><p>So know this: That feeling you have, deep down, thatâ€™s telling you itâ€™s going to be really, really tough to bounce back if this thing goes seven? That feeling is the truth. Youâ€™ve got a broken wrist that youâ€™re numbing every day and praying that it doesnâ€™t get worse each shift. Hullâ€™s on a bad knee and heâ€™s probably not suiting up for Game 7. The boys in the room are out of gas. This is it. This is <em>really </em>it.</p><p>You could have never dreamed of whatâ€™s on the other side of this period.</p><p>I mean, do you remember clearing off the snow on the lake that you used to live on outside of Detroit?</p><p>Do you remember how this all began?</p><p>Dad taught you how to skate out there when you were six years old and, man, once you got started there was no going back. You knew right away that you just loved to skate. Then you moved off the lake, so Mom built you a little rink in the backyard in the winters and you were out there basically every waking hour. And the funny thing is, you didnâ€™t even know a lick about the sport, really.</p><p>When you were five, and Dad was working his construction job, he had a talk with a few of the boys he hired to help him. They were the Rankin brothers. Jack, Mike and Bobby Rankin. Jack played some semipro hockey in his day and Bobby played in college up at St. Lawrence.</p><p>Dad told them that you had too much energy. Like way too much energy. You were always getting up to no good around the house and bothering Mom. At Kindergarten class, the teachers would complain that youâ€™d never pay attention like the other kids did and you always had to be doing something.</p><p>So Dad and the Rankin boys had an idea to keep you moving.</p><p>Hockey.</p><p>They thought that if they strapped some skates on you, you could make something of all that energy.</p><p>You understood, right away, what they were thinking. Once you got outside, and you skated in the open air on the lake â€¦ you were hooked. That feeling of the cold wind hitting your face harder and harder the faster you go drew you back out there every day.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RhXRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-44ed252a3c2e5edfadfb2b5a0f8e7962.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Mike Modano"><figcaption>Courtesy of Mike Modano</figcaption></figure><p>As you got older, you started to discover that the sport exists outside of your backyard. You and Dad would watch channel nine on Saturday nights to see those great Toronto and Montreal teams play. Sittler, Salming for the Leafs. Lafleur, Robinson for the Habs. These guys lit up on the TV. And since Dad was from Boston, on family vacations up there during the holidays, youâ€™d go to the Garden with him and see the Bruins play. The electricity in the building stayed with you long after you left.</p><p>Back home, it was just a 30-minute drive to the Joe in Detroit, where the Wings played. They were going through a tough stretch back when you were a boy. But the fans in town always had a great passion for their team. Hockey, in that part of our country, meant a lot to everyone. And the Wings gave back to their community in a bunch of different ways. You were part of that when you started going to Little Caesars hockey camps when you were 10. That took the game to a whole new level for you.</p><p>Through those camps, you were able to see more games at the Joe and fall in love with the sport even more. You began to compete against some of the best players in the area, and that led to a tough decision.</p><p>One thing a lot of people donâ€™t know is that you thought about trying to make it in tennis. You were a pretty good player as a boy, and for a bit you considered going to Florida to try and really give it a run in tennis.</p><p>Mike Modano, the tennis pro. Maybe in another life. </p><p>But in this life, you chased that feeling of freedom that only hockey could give you. That led to you, Mom and Dad making another big choice. Going to Canada for juniors was the best option if you were going to try and make it to the NHL. But it was a big choice. Mom was a bit hesitant to send you up there, especially because you were only 16.</p><p>Rick Wilson, the head coach of the Prince Albert Raiders in Saskatchewan called you up in the summer of â€™86, telling you how he wanted you to come up there and what he believed was possible for you. There was no changing your mind after that.</p><blockquote>But in this life, you chased that feeling of freedom that only hockey could give you.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Do you remember how confident you were in the decision?</p><p>Mom and Dad â€” though they wanted a few more years of you at home â€” knew it was the right call, too.</p><p>In Prince Albert, youâ€™d meet two of the most important people youâ€™d ever come across.</p><p>Ralph and Carol Ring, your billet family.</p><p>One of their sons, Martin, had just moved out, but Stephen was still there. They made your transition from Livonia to your new home as easy as you could have ever imagined. Ralph worked as an executive with the Raiders and Carol worked in city hall, but she would sing the anthem before games. They, like everyone in the town, had a deep connection to the team. The Raiders were the heartbeat of Prince Albert.</p><p>Coach Wilson and his wife, who was also named Carol, were such great leaders for that team.</p><p>You know, itâ€™s funny, because when people think of you down the road, a lot of them are going to remember you for your skating. That will be a point of pride for you. But what they wonâ€™t know is that you were a bit of late bloomer when it came to really finding that explosive stride. It wasnâ€™t until Carol Wilson, who was a great figure skater, worked with you that you started to find that next level. She made your stride a bit longer and all of sudden you gained a step on some of the older kids playing in the WHL.</p><p>Thatâ€™s what people in Prince Albert do, they help one another.</p><p>It was a small farm town, but they loved their hockey. I mean, of course, the whole country of Canada did. The word <em>passionate</em> doesnâ€™t quite cover it. So when you got to town, there was definitely some push-back about an American being up there and scoring as many points as you did. I know you remember that part. Some of the other teams always had a few guys in their bottom six that wanted to take a run at you or remind you that you werenâ€™t at home anymore.</p><p>But you got through it. I know how much you loved Prince Albert once you got to know it. You spent summers up there and youâ€™ll keep in touch with those friends you made outside the rink for life.</p><p>In the summer of â€™87, you began to see what could happen when your time with the Raiders was done.</p><p>That year, the draft was at the Joe in Detroit. Even though you werenâ€™t eligible until the next year, you and Dad went to see what it was all about. A few of the guys you played against in the WHL got picked in the first round, including Joe Sakic. You lined up against him a couple of times the year before. He was a great player and you knew if you worked hard in your draft year, you could have a chance to go early in the first round, too.</p><p>That next season, you didnâ€™t hear much about the draft until after the world juniors ended in Moscow in January. You guys didnâ€™t have a great tournament, but when you got back home the NHL released the Central Scouting Bureau draft rankings, and you saw your name up at the top with Trevor Linden. </p><p>Hereâ€™s the thing about the draft, that you might not fully appreciate for some time: Going first overall will mean a lot to you â€” to American hockey â€” as you get older. I know, at the time, you just wanted to be an NHL player. But receiving the honor of being the second American to be selected first â€¦ thatâ€™s a big deal. Trevor was a great junior player, so to battle with him through the end of that â€™88 season will help you grow.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4R9LRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-099b18178146f8d4f036c48c38d7002e.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Bruce Bennett/Getty Images"><figcaption>Bruce Bennett/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The draft was at the forum in Montreal. Your whole family was there with you, including Ralph and Carol.</p><p>I know you knew that it was likely youâ€™d go first or second, to Minnesota or Vancouver. But I also know you looked up and down that draft board and let your mind wander. You saw Pittsburgh had the fourth pick and you wondered, <em>A career playing beside Mario â€¦ what would that be like?</em></p><p>But when Lou Nanne made the call to take you first overall, youâ€™d learn that Minnesota was the place you wanted to be. That passion Michiganders have for hockey is matched by Minnesotans. And you were lucky to join a franchise like the North Stars.</p><p>The TSN interview after the pick, where you were sweaty and more nervous than youâ€™d ever been, wasnâ€™t your best. But at least your braces were off. Did you forget how you got them off a few weeks before? New teeth, new job. Pretty good week, I think.</p><p>After another year in Prince Albert, you finally had to say goodbye to the Rings and the Raiders. You headed to Kalamazoo for training camp with the North Stars in the summer of â€™89 and you learned, real quick, that the NHL was a big step up from the WHL. You walked into the locker room and saw guys like Brian Bellows, Stew Gavins and Basil McRae. You werenâ€™t in Saskatchewan anymore.</p><p>You also realized in your first practice that you werenâ€™t the fastest anymore.</p><p>That shook you a bit. But everyone in the room did a good job of welcoming you and making you feel a part of the team. That made your rookie season a bit easier.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RHiRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAASAAABA-5072c5e0f1be27eb32c6835f62a87074.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Bruce Bennett/Getty Images"><figcaption>Bruce Bennett/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But, Mike, Iâ€™ve got a quick piece of advice for you here.</p><p>Donâ€™t get in another fight. Just donâ€™t do it. I know, I know, when you dropped the gloves with Rod Brindâ€™Amour that year, it made sense in the moment. But, yeah, he handled you pretty good. You did your best â€¦ but just donâ€™t look up the fight on the Internet when youâ€™re older either. That part of the game just isnâ€™t for you, pal.</p><p>In Minnesota, you grew into the player you always wanted to be. The Stanley Cup run in â€™91 taught you a lot about what it takes to win in this league. You guys snuck into the playoffs that year with 68 points, but you learned quickly that it doesnâ€™t matter how you got there â€” what matters is <em>that </em>youâ€™re there.</p><p>The fans in Minnesota packed the arena every night during those playoffs and you only lost one home game before the Cup final. That Pittsburgh team that you ran into, man, they were good, right? Mario, Jagr, Coffeyâ€¦. They could really play. They beat you guys in six, and it stung for a while. </p><p>I know you remember that feeling this year before you played Buffalo.Â </p><p>But, of course, thereâ€™s a big difference with this yearâ€™s team. You arenâ€™t playing for Minnesota anymore. The team moved to Dallas in 1993 and I know it wasnâ€™t easy on you to say goodbye to the people of Minnesota. You were one of the leaders on that team and those last few games at the Met Center were pretty emotional. I know seeing those little boys and girls in their North Stars gear â€” knowing they wonâ€™t have a team the next year â€” that hurt.</p><p>But hockey is a business sometimes, you know that.</p><p>Not many of the guys could really believe that theyâ€™d be heading to Texas, though.</p><p>Remember when they broke the news to the team.</p><p><em>Dallas? Really? Thatâ€™s Cowboy country. </em></p><p>They had won back-to-back Super Bowls the year you headed out there and it was pretty obvious that, no matter what you did, or what they did, they were going to be the front-page story. In a way it took some of the pressure off of you as players. You were able to do your thing and try to help build up a fan base however the team wanted because people were pretty new to the sport. America wasnâ€™t the hockey hotbed it is now. In â€™93 it had only been a couple years since the Gretzky trade so the southern half of the country was still coming around on the game.</p><p>But, you noticed right away how nearly every fan who made it to a game in those first few years left with a smile on their face. And they always wanted to come back for another one. Even though the team struggled a bit those first few years, you were all building something special down there.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SIPRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-47ab79b786de8ccb0de58aa874cd5966.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Darren Carroll/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images"><figcaption>Darren Carroll/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Those Dallas fans are smart when it comes to their sports though, you saw that. After a couple of years of being there they wanted a winner. In â€™96, when things werenâ€™t going so well, Ken Hitchcock came in to coach the team and things began to change, almost immediately. He pushed you hard. There were times when guys in the room would look at each other like, <em>Can this guy just relax for a day?</em></p><p>But that was Hitch.</p><p>That summer after he came in, you sat with him and Bob Gainey, the GM, and you worked out how you could help this team get over the hill and bring a Cup to Dallas. You all decided that it would be best to add some more dimensions to your game, to make you a 200-foot player and those types of responsibilities would be given to all the veterans on the team.</p><p>You know, when you look back on how the â€™99 Cup run came to be, youâ€™ll remember the preseason trips to Vail. When Hitch took over, he made those trips to Colorado mandatory before the season started and it really helped all the guys get to know each other. There was a lot of bonding, training and a bit of golf, too. That trip in â€™99, everyone knew before the season started that the team had to make a deep run that year. The fans in Dallas were hungry and they knew you and the team were capable of getting it done.</p><p>You saw how the team shaped up that year. You knew going into the playoffs that this was going to be special. From the veterans in the room like Brett Hull and Guy Carbonneau, to leaders like Derian Hatcher and Joe Nieuwendyk and all the way through the lineup to Ed Belfour in net â€” this group was built to win big games. You just had to prove it.</p><blockquote>When you look back on how the â€™99 Cup run came to be, youâ€™ll remember the preseason trips to Vail.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>In the Conference Finals you played that great Avalanche team with the guy you saw in â€™87 at the draft, Joe Sakic. They were an excellent group and after they beat you at home in Game 5, you were down 3â€“2. Those next two games, and you know this, they were some of the best hockey youâ€™ve ever been a part of. From top to bottom Hitch had you guys executing in every zone, on every shift. To go back to Colorado and win there, then to survive a Game 7â€¦. Iâ€™m sure it felt like destiny that you would beat Buffalo in the finals.</p><p>But now youâ€™re here. In the locker room of the Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo, and itâ€™s getting late.</p><p>Itâ€™s Game 6. Youâ€™re up 3â€“2 in the series. And youâ€™re about to head out there for triple overtime.</p><p>Look around. You see how beat the guys are?</p><p>Look at Hitch. He even looks tired.</p><p>But, man, this is it.</p><p>When you get out there, just try to get the puck in their zone. Thatâ€™s the first step. Theyâ€™ve got an incredible goalie in Hasek. Heâ€™s on tonight. Youâ€™ve got to get some traffic in front of him and make him work. As the period goes on, just try to cycle it and make them skate as much as possible.</p><p>Late in the frame, when the body is hurting the most, thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll get your chance.</p><p>Youâ€™ll get the puck in the corner, youâ€™ll shake free of Zhitnik and try to play along the wall. The puck will sort of fumble toward the net, so stay with it. Hully will be out there with you and itâ€™ll be one of his first shifts in a while because of his knee. Heâ€™ll be near the crease and then itâ€™s just going to happen.</p><p>Itâ€™ll be a blur. No matter how much detail I describe it to you in, itâ€™s going to be a blur.</p><p>Youâ€™ll be trying to get the puck and next thing you know, Hasek will be on his stomach and Hully will be screaming.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RxQRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-3d5ceb7ca76bd4ab408f4185ab9f2769.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Gene J.

Puskar/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™s not going to take two days or two weeks for it to hit you that you won the Stanley Cup â€”<strong> </strong>itâ€™s going to hit you right then and there. Itâ€™s the best feeling in the world, Mike. It really is. Youâ€™re going to cry for two hours straight that night, I promise.</p><p>The pain in your wrist, in your legs â€”<strong> </strong>itâ€™ll all just fade away in a split second as you wheel into the corner with Hully.</p><p>Youâ€™ll skate around the ice with the Cup over your head, and itâ€™ll feel like it weighs a pound, not 35.</p><p>When you get back to the locker room, before the press and the friends and family can come in, there will be a moment.</p><p>Everyone on the team, from the coaches to the players, will have a chance to huddle in the middle of the room and tell each other what this experience â€” what this night â€”<strong> </strong>means to them. I want you to look around at all those guys and really soak it all. Remember your own journey. From the lake in Livonia, to Saskatchewan, to Minnesota and all the way to Dallas. Think about all the people who made this possible. Know each guy in that room has a story like yours.</p><p>Appreciate those guys and what youâ€™ve all just accomplished.</p><blockquote>Youâ€™re going to cry for two hours straight that night, I promise.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>When you get back home to Dallas, and you see Young Street packed with thousands and thousands of Stars fans, itâ€™s going to blow your mind. There will be hundreds at DFW to welcome you back when you land, too. Itâ€™s going to be incredible, trust me.</p><p>But what will take some time to set in is that your team changed the sport of hockey in the state of Texas â€” forever. Youâ€™ll notice in the few years after the Cup that the atmosphere at your home games is truly the best in the league. The fans will stand all game during the playoffs and every shot, hit and goal will sound like a touchdown at Cowboy Stadium. Dallas will become a hockey destination, because of what that â€™99 team did.</p><p>That to me, Mike, is legacy.</p><p>Be proud of that.</p><hr /><p>The Stanley Cup isnâ€™t everything. But I wanted you to really appreciate the journey you went on with those guys, and know that that team still matters to the people of Texas.</p><p>Thereâ€™s plenty more for you in the game after â€™99.</p><p>But, to be honest here, I donâ€™t want to spoil it all for you.</p><p>Thereâ€™s great things coming. From playing for the Wings, to retirement, to seeing your jersey go to the rafters in Prince Albert, to the Hockey Hall of Fame â€” this game will give you more than you could have imagined.Â You&#39;ll meet Allison, the love of your life. She will be your best friend and with her you&#39;ll find the most fulfilling life after hockey.Â But most importantly, youâ€™ll become a father to Kate, Jack, Reese, Luca and Quinn.Â Your family will be the greatest blessing of all. And thatâ€™ll change the way you see the world forever. I canâ€™t wait for you to experience that.</p><p>There will come a time in your life when youâ€™re not playing hockey anymore. Youâ€™ll go to events, or meet people, and somebody will introduce you as â€œMike Modano, one of the greatest American hockey players of all time.â€</p><p>I know you didnâ€™t grow up thinking about becoming that. All you wanted was to be a good teammate and win a Stanley Cup. But I hope that when that day comes, and you see the impact you had on the game, that it means something to you. Your generation of American players â€” guys like Hully, Tkachuk, Guerin, Roenick and so many others â€” helped pave the way for the game to reach another level here in the U.S. Those world-class players youâ€™ll see on TV when you get older, know that some of them look up to you guys right now.</p><p>You and your family worked hard to reach this point, know that. Youâ€™re one of the lucky ones who gets to play this game for a living.</p><p>So when you head out there for triple overtime, remember to cherish every second of it.</p><p>And make sure Hully gets the puck.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-a763f0463f44efbf6faef46ccf0d8dca.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Every hooper got that <em>one guy </em>from their hometown that made them fall in love with the game.</p><p><em>Everybody</em> got that guy.</p><p>For me? That was Lou Will.</p><p>Lou went to South Gwinnett, so when I was growing up, all I heard was story after story about Lou Williams.</p><p>He was <em>nice, </em>nice. To this day heâ€™s one of my favorite players.</p><p>They used to start off pretty much every game with a lob play to Lou. Heâ€™d get an early look at the rim and score<em>. </em>Right out the gate.Â </p><p>The crowd would already be standing in the bleachers before the ball dropped through the hoop. Everybody had seen it happen enough times to know it was going in. Iâ€™ll never forget how the gym would go crazy<em> </em>for like the whole game.</p><p>And Lou? He would be <em>killing</em>.</p><p>I just wanted that moment, you know? People on they feet, screaming, just going crazy for a <em>high school </em>kid.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-da1eeaafa78c4a3f8352d35b8cf0a305.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Devin Vassell"><figcaption>Courtesy of Devin Vassell</figcaption></figure><p>Back home in the driveway, Iâ€™d be practicing moves. I took pieces out of a lot of peopleâ€™s games. I was skinny â€” I was thin and long â€” so everybody was like, â€œYo, youâ€™re like KD.â€ I always kind of watched KD to see how he came into his shots, trying to analyze some of the moves that he did.</p><p><em>Whatâ€™s KD doing? Oh, howâ€™d he do that spin? Alright. Alright. Let me go try that outside</em>.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s kind of how it was for me. As I got older, I watched more and more people, just trying to study them â€” observe their specific styles. I watched Devin Booker. I watched Paul George. I studied Kawhi on defense. I watched a <em>bunch</em> of Jrue Holiday. And OF COURSE I watched LeBron. Thatâ€™s a given.Â Â </p><p>I probably looked crazy to the people in the cars that would drive down my block, eyes closed, acting like Iâ€™m somebody else, shooting fadeaways.Â </p><p>My dream was that when I got out of Gwinnett, Georgia, people would be saying, â€œMan, back in the day? That Devin Vassell kid was crazy!â€</p><p>My dream was that people would pack out my high school games. Standing room only. And I thought Iâ€™d be one and done, going almost straight to the league. <em>Buuut</em>, if Iâ€™m telling the truth, it wasnâ€™t really like that. Like <em>at all</em>.</p><p>You wanna know how my first big high school game went?</p><p>They were booing me.</p><blockquote>Record scratch, freeze-frame. â€œYouâ€™re probably wondering how I got here.â€<cite></cite></blockquote><p>I donâ€™t mean they were booing the team or our fans or something like that.Â </p><p>They were booing ME, <em>specifically.</em></p><p>It was definitely a movie moment. Just not the one I had imagined.</p><p>It was more like the movies where the hero is in some crazy situation, and itâ€™s like, <em>Record scratch, freeze-frame. </em>â€œYouâ€™re probably wondering how I got here.â€</p><hr /><p>Let me rewind a bit.</p><p>My dad had played college ball back in the day, and my brother was so much older that he was already playing basketball by the time I was born, so it wasnâ€™t long before one of them put a ball in my hands.Â </p><p>I just fell in love with the game, instantly. Really as soon as I can remember.</p><p>Me and my dad spent a lot of time in the gym together when I was growing up. But we started out just going to parks with my ball. I used to go to Collins Hill Park over by the high school over there, and Peachtree Ridge Park, which was part of my high school. Thereâ€™s a lot more parks in Gwinnett, too. Bogan Park. Listen, I could go on and on about some parks.</p><p>But Iâ€™ll never forget being outside with my dad, me running around doing moves in some like entry-level Nikes. I think they were Roshes. Him catching the rebounds and whipping the ball back to me as the sun went down.Â </p><p>And this was all <em>after</em> heâ€™d been at work all day. As soon as he came through the door, Iâ€™d be like, â€œAlright, come on, come on. Letâ€™s go, letâ€™s go.â€ And heâ€™d be all like, â€œIâ€™m tired, but all right. Iâ€™m going to do it. Iâ€™m going to do it.â€</p><p>Didnâ€™t even have no real basketball shoes yet, just out there hooping in the dark with my dad.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RczRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-3661ca39f4e7d300a88fece2daff3437.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Devin Vassell"><figcaption>Courtesy of Devin Vassell</figcaption></figure><p>As early as elementary school, when I told adults what I wanted to be when I grew up, theyâ€™d make sure to tell me that most people donâ€™t make it to the NBA. Theyâ€™d always be like, â€œWhatâ€™s your backup option?â€</p><p>I remember the first time my dream was tested.</p><p>I was in middle school, and it was my seventh-grade year. The middle school is seventh and eighth grade, so I was basically trying out for the eighth grade team.</p><p>Weâ€™re going through the tryouts, and Iâ€™m killing all the drills, killing everybody in front of me.Â </p><p>Iâ€™m like, <em>Oh, Iâ€™m set</em>.Â </p><p>After tryouts, the first roster gets released. I made that cut, so Iâ€™m like, <em>Oh, yeah. I know Iâ€™m straight.</em></p><p>Next day, the second roster gets posted. I went to look, and my name wasnâ€™t on there. My first thought was literally that it was a mistake. I went to talk to the coach thinking,<em> Thereâ€™s no way my nameâ€™s not on there</em>. But sure enough, theyâ€™re like, â€œYeah, sorry. We just donâ€™t think that you have the ability to make the team this year.â€</p><p>And the kicker: â€œBut you can be a manager.â€</p><p>Iâ€™d love to say that I took it really well. But Iâ€™d have to have been some extremely mature seventh grader.</p><p>I said, â€œNah, Iâ€™m straight,â€ and walked out of that gym so quick. I had a rolling chair in my room, and there was probably about three seconds between me storming through the front door of my house and me putting that chair through the wall. I left a <em>huge </em>hole. Then I went stomping around the neighborhood.Â </p><p>I was like, <em>Nah, there is no way. There is no way I didnâ€™t make this team.</em></p><p>Honestly, it brought down my confidence a lot.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-204085e1986c2f47574577b88012619d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Devin Vassell"><figcaption>Courtesy of Devin Vassell</figcaption></figure><p>And if it wasnâ€™t bad enough that I didnâ€™t make the team, the assistant coach was also my social studies teacher. So I had to see this man every day after that!!! Heâ€™s asking the class about British parliament or whatever and Iâ€™m just steaming.</p><p>I finished out the school year, and that summer, I transferred schools. I went to our rival school.</p><p>When I was a sophomore at Peachtree Ridge High, and my first varsity game came against those kids at my old school whoâ€™d made the team ahead of me just a few years before, I was a skinny kid with a point to prove.</p><p>But as soon as I walk in the gym, Iâ€™m already sick to my stomach. Iâ€™m thinking, <em>Iâ€™m finally here. Iâ€™m in front of all these people that knew me at my old middle schools.</em></p><p>And when I came out of the tunnel, everybody started <em>booing</em>.</p><p>Like, â€œBoo, Devin!â€Â </p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>That was my reaction. â€œOh.â€</p><p>Coach says, â€œAlright, Devin, itâ€™s time for you to go in,â€ and my heart starts pounding.</p><p>I get in the game, and Iâ€™m playing my role. Whole time, the crowd straight <em>trashing </em>me. Just talking a whole bunch of mess.</p><p>We come down the court, and I spot up in the corner. They pass the ball to me.</p><p>The <em>clank</em> of a brick means you at least got close. You hit the rim. But I didnâ€™t even do that. I airballed in front of all those people who knew me from before and were waiting for me to fail.</p><p>I said, â€œOh, no. Oh, no.â€</p><blockquote>When I came out of the tunnel, everybody started booing.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>A couple of minutes later, my rotation was still playing. The crowd still talking mess.Â </p><p>I get it again, same corner. Another air ball.</p><p>Iâ€™m thinking, <em>Oh no, get me out of here, Coach.</em></p><p>We ended up winning the game, but I bombed hard. I donâ€™t think I even attempted to shoot the rest of that game.</p><p>But after that year, every single time we played them, it was wraps for them. I was <em>good</em> after that. I just needed to shake off the nerves.</p><hr /><p>I think everybody whoâ€™s ever tried to be really great at something has a story like that. They had a game where they just ... werenâ€™t good. I know I probably have a few more of those moments to look forward to in my NBA career.</p><p>But those moments are learning opportunities. I know that no matter what exactly is ahead of me, there are going to be ups and there are going to be downs, both on and off the court.</p><p>Iâ€™ve already dealt with some of that. Some of the biggest challenges Iâ€™ve faced, people donâ€™t even know about.</p><p>When I was around sixth and seventh grade, my family was going through some things. I donâ€™t like to talk too much about whatâ€™s going on in my private life. I keep everything in-house, especially when it comes to family stuff.</p><p>But one of the greatest challenges Iâ€™ve faced in my life was back then, when my mom had been having severe back issues and had to go through surgeries and stuff like that. She had been a nurse up to that point and used to work long hours, but she couldnâ€™t work anymore and had to go on disability.Â </p><p>Just seeing her sometimes not feeling her best was very tough on me mentally as a kid. Maybe more than I even realized.</p><p>Seeing that it wasnâ€™t as easy for her to do some stuff anymore, like getting out of the car, or just walking around â€” when that kind of thing happens to someone thatâ€™s very important in your life, it can take a toll.</p><p>But my mom is one of the strongest people on the planet, and with her being as strong as she is, it just became motivation for me. It was motivation for us all, as a family.</p><p>Iâ€™m lucky to be close with both of my parents, and theyâ€™ve really tried to prepare me for everything thatâ€™s ahead of me. Weâ€™ve had a lot of talks, but mainly their message has been to stay grounded. They told me, â€œBe who you are, stay humble, and remember where you came from.â€</p><p>Iâ€™ll never forget those lessons.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SlfRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAARAAABA-07585905882adfbb09343672e7eccb2f.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Mark Wallheiser/AP Photo"><figcaption>Mark Wallheiser/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>And I wonâ€™t forget that no matter whether I won or lost, or when I didnâ€™t make the team, they never stopped believing in my dream.</p><p>Thereâ€™s still so much more that I have left to prove. Iâ€™ll always have that mindset. Thatâ€™s not going to go away, no matter the success, no matter whatâ€™s going on in my life.Â </p><p>I think that just growing up my whole life and not being ranked, not getting some of the credit or recognition I feel like I deserved, it definitely stays with me.</p><p>But it also makes this moment â€” right now, as I prepare for draft night â€” that much more of a blessing.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s a blessing to be where Iâ€™m at, and Iâ€™ll never take that for granted.</p><hr /><p>Alright, one last story. March 2019, ACC tournament quarterfinals. FSU vs. Virginia Tech.</p><p>Weâ€™re down three, with about seven seconds left in the game.</p><p>I was on a hot streak and had made three of five three-pointers.Â </p><p>Everybody had been telling me, â€œYouâ€™re hot, youâ€™re hot. Keep shooting if you get open.â€Â </p><p>So now, weâ€™re in the huddle. A play is called. Iâ€™m in the game, but the play isnâ€™t just for me â€” there are options. Trent Forrest was inbounding, and there was somebody wide open, right next to him.Â </p><p>But when we came out the huddle, I said, â€œBro, listen, if you pass it to me, Iâ€™m shooting it.â€Â </p><p>He looked at me. I said, â€œIf you pass it to me, Iâ€™m shooting it. So take it for what you want.â€</p><p>And he was just like, â€œAlright.â€</p><p>So, Trent gets up to the line, and he looks. He sees me come up the screen and just <em>darts</em> it to me.</p><p>I come off of a flare screen to the corner and hit the three, with a hand in the face.Â </p><p>I looked back at Trent and said, â€œWell, I told you.â€</p><p>We ended up winning in overtime. And the craziest thing about it all wasnâ€™t even the hot streak I went on that night. It was that they came to the freshman.</p><p>They came to a freshman for that. Itâ€™s just the fact that they had that much confidence in me. Not only the coaches, but my teammates.Â </p><p>It was huge. It meant everything.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SaTRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADgEAA-536672a47f4f1a595d5259be5991382e.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Tori Lynn Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat"><figcaption>Tori Lynn Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat</figcaption></figure><p>When I was younger, my goal was always to be one and done, always. Elementary school, I was like <em>Yeah, Iâ€™m going to be at the McDonald&#39;s game. One and done. Itâ€™s wraps.Â </em></p><p>Then when I got offered by Florida State they told me that Iâ€™d probably have to redshirt my first year. So all that went out the window. But I just told myself, I said, <em>Iâ€™m going to go to Florida State for two years. Iâ€™ll be there for two years, and then Iâ€™m gone.</em></p><p>I kept that to myself. I told my parents, and my close friends, and that was it.Â </p><p>But I stayed in my role and didnâ€™t step on nobodyâ€™s toes â€” and I just kept working.</p><p>People are gonna tell you that youâ€™re not gonna make it because you might not be the biggest. You might not be the fastest. You might not be the strongest. They might even want you to be the team manager.</p><p>But it doesnâ€™t matter if you put in the work.</p><p>I just put it in the work and stuck to my dream.</p><p>Everything Iâ€™ve ever done, every experience Iâ€™ve ever had, every challenge Iâ€™ve ever faced, has led me to this moment.Â </p><p>And as I sit here writing this, in my blue 2020 NBA Draft Combine polo shirt, I want to remember it all.</p><p>When my sophomore year at FSU finally came around, I said to myself, <em>Well, you said you were only going to be here for two.Â </em></p><p>This is two.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s time.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-c4d86f089a1fb43bae949e7ba350f2df.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><br/>During every pregame skate, I used to look into the crowd and wonder what the fans could see.</p><p>I mean, like, what could they <em>really </em>see?</p><p>Could they see the cuts on my hands â€” and the blood on my laces â€” from obsessively lacing and relacing my skates again and again?</p><p>Could they see the bags under my eyes from having gotten just two hours of sleep for the fifth straight night?</p><p>Could they see the pain I was going through from trying to work up the nerve to tell the coach that tonight was the night when it was just all too much, and I couldnâ€™t play?</p><p>Iâ€™ve been an NHL player for 11 years. And until very recently, Iâ€™ve had untreated obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD as we commonly know it. </p><p>There is simply no way to overstate the impact itâ€™s had on my career, and on my life. It controlled me, it almost broke me for good. And there were times when I thought I might never be able to tell a story like this. But Iâ€™m here, and I am. </p><p>I want to tell this story because, really, itâ€™s not about me. Itâ€™s about what <em>happened</em> to me, yes â€” but itâ€™s not about me. Itâ€™s about, hopefully, getting people help. Even just one person. I know, without a doubt, that there are athletes and people all around the world suffering from the same thing I do, or something similar. Because I understand what OCD, if left untreated for too long, can do to a person. </p><p>The thing is, in the beginning, it seemed harmless. And I remember the beginning. </p><p>I mean the very, very beginning.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RkfRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-81cb2b8b0d7008da3e12e204f93c3f6f.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Colin Wilson"><figcaption>Courtesy of Colin Wilson</figcaption></figure><p>When I was little, maybe seven or eight years old, Iâ€™d count the trees when I would go on car rides with my parents. Iâ€™d be in the back seat of our caravan, and Iâ€™d watch them go by. </p><p><em>One, two, three, four</em>. </p><p>Then Iâ€™d restart. </p><p><em>One, two, three, four</em>. </p><p>The faster we went, the faster the trees would pass and the faster Iâ€™d count.</p><p>It didnâ€™t seem out of the ordinary. It was just â€¦ I donâ€™t know, the way I was.</p><p>My OCD manifested itself in different forms throughout my life. When I was in junior hockey, and even when I played at BU. I worried constantly about injuries. Iâ€™d think about my knees when I was on the ice, despite never having had any knee problems before. I had a chronic groin injury from when I was younger, and when it would be flaring up, Iâ€™d just drop down into a squat while I was doing everyday things to make sure it was O.K.</p><p>It was that feeling of a lack of control that eventually triggered the negative thoughts â€” like the ones I used to have during pregame skates.</p><p>And itâ€™s almost this entirely separate part of your brain that gets activated when this happens. For me, my ability to play hockey never felt threatened when I was young. I grew up in Winnipeg, and like so many kids, I wanted to play in the NHL. And I always knew deep down that I was going to make it. My dad and grandfather had both played in the NHL. Itâ€™s all I ever wanted to do. Itâ€™s all I ever wanted to <em>be</em>. </p><blockquote>My OCD played a role in making me the player I was.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>For a long time, I didnâ€™t have negative thoughts on the ice. I obsessed over my game, but in a positive way. I wanted to be the best player I could be because it was â€¦ it was everything to me.</p><p>My OCD played a role in making me the player I was. And I know there are many athletes out there who have that same connection. They might be afraid to seek help because on the outside theyâ€™re â€œsucceedingâ€ and they wonâ€™t want to change anything. I know I can tell them that that isnâ€™t the case, but I also know they might not believe me.</p><p>Because I probably wouldnâ€™t have believed it, either.</p><hr /><p><br/>When the Nashville Predators took me in the first round of the draft in 2008, it was such an incredible moment to experience with my family. I had no negative thoughts or concerns about any of my OCD tendencies. I was just me. Colin Wilson, NHL player. Thatâ€™s what mattered. And at the time I donâ€™t think the term <em>OCD</em> had ever been brought up to me or had even crossed my mind.</p><p>Iâ€™d always tried to hide anything I did that could have been classified by others as superstitious or odd. But once I reached the NHL, I basically couldnâ€™t anymore.</p><p>I remember in 2010, my rookie year, when Predators GM David Poile sat me down with assistant GM Paul Fenton, team psychologist Gary Solomon, and my parents and told me I had OCD.</p><p>They had noticed after picking up on a preflight routine Iâ€™d go through at airports.</p><p>To be honest, Iâ€™m a bit hesitant to talk about this part, because my tendencies, my experiences, theyâ€™re personal to me. And I donâ€™t want anyone to read this and feel bad for me, or to think Iâ€™m glorifying what I went through. But I feel itâ€™s important because the element of control â€” of having it or not having it â€” is what pushes people with OCD into dark places.</p><p>Before a flight, I had things I needed to do. I had to clean up all the trash around our gate. Every single wrapper, piece of plastic, you name it. Into the trash. Then I had to be the last passenger on the plane, no matter what. Then, finally, I actually had to talk to the pilots. It didnâ€™t have to be about anything specific, but I had to at least talk to them. After I did all that, I felt safe to fly.</p><p>It stemmed from a fear of flying Iâ€™d had ever since I was a kid â€” and had grown into this routine. It all revolved around control of the situation. I needed to feel like I had a hand in what was going on.</p><p>But at the time I completely discounted what David Poile and everyone else was telling me. I was a 20-year-old living his dream in the NHL. I felt fine, I felt healthy.</p><p><em>Thereâ€™s no chance I have that, </em>I thought.</p><p>I donâ€™t know what would have happened if I had taken that talk more seriously. Which is one of the reasons I want to help those who are facing the same things I did, because I know what itâ€™s like being on the other side of the table. It can be hard to accept what youâ€™re hearing. And I didnâ€™t. I just ignored it and told them I would be fine. I hid myself, and my issues, from everyone.</p><p>After that, I basically spent the majority of my career in what Iâ€™d call fight-or-flight mode.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4R1rRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-425150aadb9589930a2b932a3b4ef6d1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Andrew Dieb/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images"><figcaption>Andrew Dieb/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>To this day, I honestly have no damn clue how I scored 20 goals in the 2014â€“15 season. I played each game, for years, in this state of panic because my OCD had begun to take over every element of my life. I went from obsessing over injuries off the ice to thinking I was going to get hurt every time I stepped on it â€” thinking I&#39;d get hurt every shift. Or feeling like my skates werenâ€™t tied properly. Iâ€™d have to stay in the locker room and tie them over and over again, as tight as I could, until my hands bled. And that was just a short-term fix. For years, I felt like I was skating on stilts because my skates never felt right. But I just got into this terrible state, like a petrified animal trapped in a corner. I was almost unconscious on the ice, in a way.</p><p>I was so energized after games that I couldnâ€™t sleep, and the lack of sleep led me down a road that I wouldnâ€™t wish on my worst enemy. I truly mean that.</p><p>Thereâ€™s a version of this story where I tell you what happened next.</p><p>I read those kinds of stories all the time, and I think theyâ€™re very powerful and important. The bravery and honesty of those who have gone through the darkest of moments and can share their experiences with others should be applauded. But what I went through is just for me to know right now, and I hope youâ€™ll respect that.</p><p>All I can say really is that, during the Stanley Cup finals in 2017, when we were playing the Penguins â€” I hit bottom.</p><p>My brain blew up.</p><p>I was a shell of the person I am today.</p><p>For the three or so years leading up to that point, I had been taking Xanax and Seroquel to help me sleep. One is addictive and gets you high, the other I would refer to as a horse tranquilizer, because it would knock me out. One night I would take Xanax, the next Seroquel. During that playoff run, I had started partying more as well, to numb the pain. The combination of those pills, mixed with alcohol, and years of untreated OCD â€¦ I found rock bottom.</p><p>Those had been prescribed to me to <em>help </em>me. But they didnâ€™t do that at all. They made me lose myself. The stressors I had â€” the OCD, the lack of sleep, the pressure of playoff hockey â€” those pills just seemed to amplify all that and drive me to a place I never wanted to get to.Â </p><blockquote>The combination of those pills, mixed with alcohol, and years of untreated OCD â€¦ I found rock bottom.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>It became so bad that I remember when we beat Anaheim to win the Western Conference finals, everyone on the team was, of course, really happy. But all I wanted to do was go home and bawl my eyes out. I was a complete emotional wreck. I felt like I hadnâ€™t been playing my best. I felt like I hadnâ€™t contributed enough to the success of the team and it was driving me insane.</p><p>One of the things about OCD is that you have this internal critic that nags at you â€” that constantly reminds you that, no matter how hard you try, you arenâ€™t ever in control, and because youâ€™re not, you arenâ€™t good enough.</p><p>And in the Cup finals, I was barely able to function. I was running on fumes, my head felt like it was on fire â€” I felt like I was going insane.</p><p>I knew I couldnâ€™t live like this anymore. The team and my family had noticed that I wasnâ€™t myself. When the season ended, after we lost the Cup finals, I realized that the only choice I had was to truly heal myself. I had started talking to a therapist earlier that season when I was really struggling, but what happened in the playoffs pushed me to work on myself even more.</p><p>After Nashville traded me to the Avalanche that summer, I continued to keep my issues from nearly everyone. But one of the most important connections Iâ€™ve ever made in my life was when I was introduced to a trained plant-medicine facilitator after the trade.</p><p>The way in which so many mental health cases are treated with pills and other addictive, unhealthy measures, really didnâ€™t sit well with me. So under the guide of my facilitator, I started taking doses of psychedelics and other similar medicines that may seem unapproachable for many. But it was that sort of alternative help that did so much for me.Â </p><p>The word <em>psychedelics</em> might put people off, I get that â€” but I canâ€™t stress enough how critical they were in my recovery. That experience showed me a completely different side of myself and gave me a deep sense of spirituality. It put me in touch with a part of me that I didnâ€™t even know existed. I felt like what I was experiencing was greater than myself, my journey, if that makes sense.</p><p>Finding this differing approach changed my life, without a doubt.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RK2RXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAATAAABA-03b0a864b8eecdc7e53beacb035c2317.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Michael Martin/NHLI via Getty Images)"><figcaption>Michael Martin/NHLI via Getty Images)</figcaption></figure><p>Alternative medicines are important and should always be considered when treating mental health issues.</p><p>I have a plan for how to help introduce it to others, but it wasnâ€™t just finding myself spiritually that helped, of course.</p><p>In 2019, during my second year in Colorado, I made another really significant breakthrough â€” I contacted the NHLPA, which put me in touch with an OCD specialist. And meeting that person changed my life. It was like meeting with a psychic, in a way.</p><p>He asked me if Iâ€™d ever felt like I was going crazy, if Iâ€™d ever felt like my world was completely out of control. My jaw was on the floor. I couldnâ€™t believe what I was hearing. He was asking me â€” almost telling me â€” about myself and connecting with me like someone who actually got it. He wasnâ€™t just there to prescribe some numbing drug or tell me to just think about something else.</p><p>For the first time in my entire adult life, I felt understood.</p><p>In those sessions, I began to understand that one of the key steps in the healing process is not only acknowledging that whatâ€™s going on in your brain isnâ€™t normal, but also, more importantly, acknowledging that it <em>isnâ€™t</em> your fault.</p><p>Since I started with the specialist, Iâ€™ve learned to develop a sense of self-compassion that I didnâ€™t have before. Itâ€™s so difficult to not blame myself when I feel my mind going to â€¦ <em>that</em> place. So now I do my best to be aware, to tell myself that things like that will happen from time to time, and to just assure myself that itâ€™s going to be O.K.Â </p><hr /><p><br/>I knew my OCD wouldnâ€™t go away just because somebody could see it for what it was. And I wonâ€™t lie to you ... every day since then has been hard. I still have an internal alarm that goes off when I feel like I need to be in control. It can be exhausting to deal with. But every day since that meeting last year, it has also gotten easier.Â </p><p>But this last year has been tough. I had to have double hip surgery in December 2019 because of issues that came from the groin problems Iâ€™ve had since I was a kid. But my hips havenâ€™t healed properly, and I havenâ€™t been able to walk normally all year, so I just had to have it done again. Itâ€™s hard because I havenâ€™t been on the ice in a long, long time. I havenâ€™t had much control.</p><p>I donâ€™t know when I will again, either. </p><p>If Iâ€™m being honest, I think my days of playing hockey are probably over.</p><p>I havenâ€™t quite come to terms with it fully. But that is the truth.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SSARXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAWAAABA-ed619afb4671ac9f0c4ef3acd11e41b5.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Russell Lansford/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images"><figcaption>Russell Lansford/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Iâ€™ve done a lot to prepare for my next step in life. Iâ€™m completely sober. Iâ€™m back at school in Boston working on a psychology major. The last few years Iâ€™ve been working with a new, more traditional talk therapist who has been one of the pillars that I lean on as I transition toward life after hockey. Theyâ€™ve helped me think through everything and see the next chapter of my life in a positive light.</p><p>Iâ€™m also working with a group of people I got connected with over the last three years of getting help, and weâ€™re going to open a space in Austin for alternative medicines and approaches to mental health issues â€” OCD included.</p><blockquote>Mental health, and what we know about it, is evolving and so must the ways we treat it.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>We want to help people, both physiologically and neurologically, through things like neurofeedback, floating, assisted psychotherapy, and other alternative therapies that arenâ€™t widely accessible. Weâ€™ll also have teaching programs to ensure that once you leave, youâ€™ll know how to keep up your routines on your own. Itâ€™s going to be a space that completely strips any stigma away from mental health issues. It will be a place that will be nourishing and safe, for all those who desperately need it.</p><p>Mental health, and what we know about it, is evolving and so must the ways we treat it.</p><p>I want people to know that there are spaces where you can be yourself, where you can feel understood and loved and know that there is help there for you. I want <em>that </em>to be what you take out of this story.</p><p>The human experience includes an incredible amount of suffering, even if youâ€™re living your dream. There are lots of people battling OCD right now. I know how brave they are, how strong they are for fighting it. I know itâ€™s probably taken over their lives, and they feel like thereâ€™s nowhere to turn to, or nobody to help them â€¦ to <em>understand </em>them. But I want them to know that there <em>is</em> someone. And I hope that they know Iâ€™m here to help.</p><p>We canâ€™t get through it alone.</p><p>If it werenâ€™t for the people who truly helped me â€” my spiritual counsel, my alternative medicine facilitator, my OCD therapist and my talk therapist â€” I wouldnâ€™t be the person I am today. Thatâ€™s my team, and they have given me the opportunity to help others.</p><p>Thatâ€™s my focus in life right now. </p><p>And like I said, I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be back out on the ice anytime soon. But I know that, no matter what the future holds for me, <em>I did it</em>. I played in the NHL. I lived my dream. And I fought through hell to make a career for myself. My name might not be on the Stanley Cup, and thatâ€™s fine. Because I know there is an opportunity ahead of me to not just leave my mark on the game of hockey, but also on lives all across the world. </p><p>I donâ€™t want to pretend like I have it all figured out, because I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m still learning as I go. But what I do know comes from what I went through. So if youâ€™re going through it, remember this:</p><p>Be kind to yourself, to your mind.</p><p>Have patience with your soul, your body.</p><p>And know that you donâ€™t have to do it alone.</p><p>â€”Colin</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-1cce4c2788a09699433b3ed72e6b54c7.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>I take 64 pills a day.<br/><br/>Sixty-four pills: Thatâ€™s 25 before breakfast, another 20 after breakfast, another 10 before dinner, and another 9 before bed.<br/><br/>I take 64 pills a day, and I feel like itâ€™s slowly killing me. Or if itâ€™s not killing me, directly, then I at least know one thing for sure: Itâ€™s really bad for me. Longterm, taking that much medicine on that regular of a regimen is just straight-up bad for you. Itâ€™s literally an elaborate trick that you play on yourself â€” a lie that you tell your body so it keeps thinking everything is fine. <br/><br/>Itâ€™s a never-ending, exhausting, miserable cycle.<br/><br/>But I do it anyway.<br/><br/>I do it anyway because I have Lyme disease. (Since Iâ€™m not a doctor, I say I have â€œchronic Lyme.â€ Itâ€™s a shorter way for me to say that this disease is still affecting me after more than a decade â€” I prefer it to the alternative, which is â€œPost-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome with a current active infection with a different strain of borrelia and bartonella as well as other co-infections.â€) Taking 64 pills a day is the only way to keep my condition under any sort of control. Itâ€™s the only way to keep myself healthy enough to play the game that I love â€” healthy enough to do my job and earn the paycheck that supports my family.<br/><br/>Healthy enough to live something approaching a normal life.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRvJkAQBXRUJQVlA4IOZkAQCwDAe-1ed317e0f52b4e2867a3eedfa024a2a6.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Elena Delle Donne"><figcaption>Elena Delle Donne</figcaption></figure><p>I regret not having done more in the past to speak up about Lyme disease. Itâ€™s a terrifying thing to live with, yet not many people know much about it â€” and I take my fair share of responsibility for that. I could have been using my platform to help raise awareness, and to help improve understanding. I could have been helping so much more.<br/><br/>I know that I <em>need to help</em> so much more.<br/><br/>I know that I need to help us get to a place with Lyme disease where what happened to me this past week never happens to anyone else.<br/><br/>Hereâ€™s the gist of what happened.<br/><br/>When news of COVID started spreading, I immediately took it seriously. Thatâ€™s not me bragging; those are just the instincts Iâ€™ve developed after more than a decade of living with Lyme disease. Iâ€™ve been told time and time again over the years that my condition makes me<em> immunocompromised</em> â€” that part of what Lyme does is it debilitates my immune system. Iâ€™ve had a common cold that sent my immune system spiraling into a serious relapse. Iâ€™ve relapsed off of a simple flu shot. Thereâ€™s just been so many instances where Iâ€™ve contracted something that shouldnâ€™t have been that big of a deal, but it blew my immune system out and turned into something scary.</p><blockquote>Itâ€™s a terrifying thing to live with, yet not many people know much about it â€” and I take my fair share of responsibility for that.<cite></cite></blockquote><p><br/>Thatâ€™s just something I deal with. And so when I read that immunocompromised people are at a higher risk with COVID, I took every possible precaution. (Which, by the way, I realize is a huge privilege I have that most people donâ€™t.) I treated COVID like any high-risk person should: as a matter of life and death.</p><p>So when the WNBA started the process of organizing the bubble, I paid careful attention to what measures they were putting in place to make it safe. I <em>know </em>how much work went into this, and I know so many people at the league put in crazy hours to protect the players and make it as safe as possible. But the fact of the matter is, I was told that when it came down to it, it would be impossible to keep COVID-19 out of the bubble entirely. And then Florida cases started rising. And even if the bubble is the safest place in Floridaâ€¦.. if I had to go to a hospital, and the hospital was overwhelmed, then what? <br/><br/>I still wanted to play, but I was <em>scared</em>. I talked to my personal physician about what the league planned to do, and he felt it was still too risky.<br/><br/>When the league began reviewing playersâ€™ cases to see who should be granted a health exemption from the bubble (meaning the league excuses you from playing, but you donâ€™t have to give up your salary), I didnâ€™t even think it was a <em>question </em>whether I would be exempt or not. I didnâ€™t need a panel of league doctors to tell me that my immune system was high-risk â€” Iâ€™ve <em>played my entire career</em> with an immune system thatâ€™s high-risk!!!<br/><br/>I LIVE with an immune system thatâ€™s high-risk.</p><p>But I made sure to follow protocol.<br/><br/>The doctor who treats my Lyme disease wrote up a full report, detailing my medical history and confirming my high-risk status. The Mystics team doctor (who is awesome, but whoâ€™s never treated my Lyme disease) wrote a report essentially deferring to my Lyme disease doctor, and agreeing about my high risk profile. I filed both reports to the league, as required, along with a signed form waiving my right to an appeal.<br/><br/>A few days later, the leagueâ€™s panel of doctors â€” without ever once speaking to me or to either of my doctors â€” informed me that they were denying my request for a health exemption.<br/><br/>Iâ€™m now left with two choices: I can either risk my lifeâ€¦.. or forfeit my paycheck.<br/><br/>Honestly? That <em>hurts</em>.<br/><br/>It hurts a lot. And maybe being hurt just makes me naive. And I know that, as athletes, weâ€™re not really supposed to talk about our feelings. But feelings are pretty much all I have left right now. I donâ€™t have NBA player money. I donâ€™t have the desire to go to war with the league on this. And I canâ€™t appeal.<br/><br/>So really all Iâ€™m left with is how much this hurts. How much it hurts that the W â€” a place thatâ€™s been my one big dream in life for as long as I can remember, and that Iâ€™ve given my blood, sweat and tears to for seven going on eight seasons â€” has basically told me that Iâ€™m wrong about whatâ€™s happening in my own body. What I hear in their decision is that Iâ€™m a fool for believing my doctor. That Iâ€™m faking a disability. That Iâ€™m trying to â€œget outâ€ of work and still collect a paycheck.</p><p>Yupâ€¦.. they caught me.<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s why I played in the finals last year with THREE HERNIATED DISCS IN MY BACK.<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s why I work out during the seven months a year when weâ€™re not in season, when no oneâ€™s watching me, when Iâ€™m not collecting my player salary. </p><blockquote>I donâ€™t have NBA player money. I donâ€™t have the desire to go to war with the league on this. And I canâ€™t appeal.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve crammed my 6â€™5â€ body into so many coach class flights that I almost forget what itâ€™s like to have legs and feet that <em>arenâ€™t </em>dangerously swollen.<br/><br/>Thatâ€™s why I take 64 pills a day.<br/><br/>Because Iâ€™m the type of player who makes up a condition to avoid playing basketball.<br/><br/>They figured me out.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRjSAABXRUJQVlA4ICiAADQcASdA-babd7142f49ff8a27d2c0f109f62b3d8.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Katherine Frey/The Washington Post/Getty"><figcaption>Katherine Frey/The Washington Post/Getty</figcaption></figure><p>For the record: Iâ€™m not writing this letter to announce my plans. Iâ€™m still thinking very carefully and weighing my options.<br/><br/>But I wanted to write this for three main reasons.<br/><br/>First, like I said: I know itâ€™s way past time for me to take a more public role in the battle against Lyme disease â€” a battle that Iâ€™ve been fighting mostly privately for years. Iâ€™m truly sorry that I didnâ€™t do more, sooner. But I have this platform and I want to help. I hope this is a start.<br/><br/>Second, I know that the decision Iâ€™m facing â€” risk my life or forfeit my paycheck â€” is far from a unique one. I know that millions of Americans right now, in situations that are much worse than my own, are facing similar decisions. And of course many are dealing with even worse than that: Millions more are out of work entirely. Many of them â€” especially Black and brown people, and especially Black and brown LGBTQ people â€” are dealing with food insecurity and homelessness. I want to express my deepest solidarity with them.<br/><br/>And then the last thing I wanted to say here â€” and probably the best lesson Iâ€™ve learned through my experience with Lyme disease â€” is this: <em>Thereâ€™s so much in the world that we donâ€™t know. </em><br/><br/>Itâ€™s something that I started to think about around when I first started showing symptoms for Lyme. I had these migraines, and these night sweats. I had extreme fatigue and body aches. I felt awful, all the time. But we still had no idea what it was. For a while we had no clue. One doctor would look and think it was one thing, another doctor would look and think it was another thing, and so on. Even when I went to the right doctor, finally, a Lyme-literate doctor, who properly diagnosed me â€” even <em>then </em>there was still so much that we had no clue about. There were a million different treatments; there was a lot of trial and error; there was a little bit of everything. </p><blockquote>Itâ€™s way past time for me to take a more public role in the battle against Lyme disease â€” a battle that Iâ€™ve been fighting mostly privately for years.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>And in a weird way, going through that became this sort of realization for me. <br/><br/>I think when youâ€™re younger, and growing up, if youâ€™re relatively healthy, you think of the world as very black and white, very solutions-oriented: <em>When this happens, we do that, and then itâ€™s fixed. Or: When I feel sick, I go to the doctor, and then I get better.</em> That was more or less how I viewed things. But then all of the uncertainty with my Lyme diagnosis happened, and I went on that whole journeyâ€¦.. and it really began to hit me, I guess, just how much is out there that we donâ€™t know. <br/><br/>Now, 12 years into that journey, itâ€™s still hitting me how much we donâ€™t know.<br/><br/>And whether itâ€™s these last several months of pandemic that weâ€™ve been dealing with and doing our best to adapt to, or itâ€™s these last several weeks of activism that have inspired the rethinking of so many of our old power structures, or itâ€™s anything elseâ€¦. I feel like this entire year, in some way, has been one long example of that same type of journey â€” of people discovering things that they didnâ€™t know about the world, and realizing how much they still have to learn.<br/><br/>And that can be pretty intimidating, for sure. It can be stressful to think about. <br/><br/>But I also think thereâ€™s a valuable idea in there â€” just in terms of how we treat other people. <br/><br/>I think the idea is something like: We can never fully understand what someone else is going through, or what theyâ€™ve been through â€” in the same way that no one else can ever fully understand what weâ€™re going through, or what weâ€™ve been through.<br/><br/><em>Thereâ€™s so much in the world that we donâ€™t know.</em><br/><br/>Which means the best that we can do is to listen to each other, and to learn from each other â€” with as much humility as possible.<br/><br/>I hope that in the future the WNBA can aspire to do the same.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Elena</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-53b2bf5a9b755239ccf17d348f71a0a1.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>
