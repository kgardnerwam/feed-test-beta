        <![CDATA[<p>Every hooper got that <em>one guy </em>from their hometown that made them fall in love with the game.</p><p><em>Everybody</em> got that guy.</p><p>For me? That was Lou Will.</p><p>Lou went to South Gwinnett, so when I was growing up, all I heard was story after story about Lou Williams.</p><p>He was <em>nice, </em>nice. To this day heâ€™s one of my favorite players.</p><p>They used to start off pretty much every game with a lob play to Lou. Heâ€™d get an early look at the rim and score<em>. </em>Right out the gate.Â </p><p>The crowd would already be standing in the bleachers before the ball dropped through the hoop. Everybody had seen it happen enough times to know it was going in. Iâ€™ll never forget how the gym would go crazy<em> </em>for like the whole game.</p><p>And Lou? He would be <em>killing</em>.</p><p>I just wanted that moment, you know? People on they feet, screaming, just going crazy for a <em>high school </em>kid.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-da1eeaafa78c4a3f8352d35b8cf0a305.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Devin Vassell"><figcaption>Courtesy of Devin Vassell</figcaption></figure><p>Back home in the driveway, Iâ€™d be practicing moves. I took pieces out of a lot of peopleâ€™s games. I was skinny â€” I was thin and long â€” so everybody was like, â€œYo, youâ€™re like KD.â€ I always kind of watched KD to see how he came into his shots, trying to analyze some of the moves that he did.</p><p><em>Whatâ€™s KD doing? Oh, howâ€™d he do that spin? Alright. Alright. Let me go try that outside</em>.Â </p><p>Thatâ€™s kind of how it was for me. As I got older, I watched more and more people, just trying to study them â€” observe their specific styles. I watched Devin Booker. I watched Paul George. I studied Kawhi on defense. I watched a <em>bunch</em> of Jrue Holiday. And OF COURSE I watched LeBron. Thatâ€™s a given.Â Â </p><p>I probably looked crazy to the people in the cars that would drive down my block, eyes closed, acting like Iâ€™m somebody else, shooting fadeaways.Â </p><p>My dream was that when I got out of Gwinnett, Georgia, people would be saying, â€œMan, back in the day? That Devin Vassell kid was crazy!â€</p><p>My dream was that people would pack out my high school games. Standing room only. And I thought Iâ€™d be one and done, going almost straight to the league. <em>Buuut</em>, if Iâ€™m telling the truth, it wasnâ€™t really like that. Like <em>at all</em>.</p><p>You wanna know how my first big high school game went?</p><p>They were booing me.</p><blockquote>Record scratch, freeze-frame. â€œYouâ€™re probably wondering how I got here.â€<cite></cite></blockquote><p>I donâ€™t mean they were booing the team or our fans or something like that.Â </p><p>They were booing ME, <em>specifically.</em></p><p>It was definitely a movie moment. Just not the one I had imagined.</p><p>It was more like the movies where the hero is in some crazy situation, and itâ€™s like, <em>Record scratch, freeze-frame. </em>â€œYouâ€™re probably wondering how I got here.â€</p><hr /><p>Let me rewind a bit.</p><p>My dad had played college ball back in the day, and my brother was so much older that he was already playing basketball by the time I was born, so it wasnâ€™t long before one of them put a ball in my hands.Â </p><p>I just fell in love with the game, instantly. Really as soon as I can remember.</p><p>Me and my dad spent a lot of time in the gym together when I was growing up. But we started out just going to parks with my ball. I used to go to Collins Hill Park over by the high school over there, and Peachtree Ridge Park, which was part of my high school. Thereâ€™s a lot more parks in Gwinnett, too. Bogan Park. Listen, I could go on and on about some parks.</p><p>But Iâ€™ll never forget being outside with my dad, me running around doing moves in some like entry-level Nikes. I think they were Roshes. Him catching the rebounds and whipping the ball back to me as the sun went down.Â </p><p>And this was all <em>after</em> heâ€™d been at work all day. As soon as he came through the door, Iâ€™d be like, â€œAlright, come on, come on. Letâ€™s go, letâ€™s go.â€ And heâ€™d be all like, â€œIâ€™m tired, but all right. Iâ€™m going to do it. Iâ€™m going to do it.â€</p><p>Didnâ€™t even have no real basketball shoes yet, just out there hooping in the dark with my dad.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RczRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-3661ca39f4e7d300a88fece2daff3437.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Devin Vassell"><figcaption>Courtesy of Devin Vassell</figcaption></figure><p>As early as elementary school, when I told adults what I wanted to be when I grew up, theyâ€™d make sure to tell me that most people donâ€™t make it to the NBA. Theyâ€™d always be like, â€œWhatâ€™s your backup option?â€</p><p>I remember the first time my dream was tested.</p><p>I was in middle school, and it was my seventh-grade year. The middle school is seventh and eighth grade, so I was basically trying out for the eighth grade team.</p><p>Weâ€™re going through the tryouts, and Iâ€™m killing all the drills, killing everybody in front of me.Â </p><p>Iâ€™m like, <em>Oh, Iâ€™m set</em>.Â </p><p>After tryouts, the first roster gets released. I made that cut, so Iâ€™m like, <em>Oh, yeah. I know Iâ€™m straight.</em></p><p>Next day, the second roster gets posted. I went to look, and my name wasnâ€™t on there. My first thought was literally that it was a mistake. I went to talk to the coach thinking,<em> Thereâ€™s no way my nameâ€™s not on there</em>. But sure enough, theyâ€™re like, â€œYeah, sorry. We just donâ€™t think that you have the ability to make the team this year.â€</p><p>And the kicker: â€œBut you can be a manager.â€</p><p>Iâ€™d love to say that I took it really well. But Iâ€™d have to have been some extremely mature seventh grader.</p><p>I said, â€œNah, Iâ€™m straight,â€ and walked out of that gym so quick. I had a rolling chair in my room, and there was probably about three seconds between me storming through the front door of my house and me putting that chair through the wall. I left a <em>huge </em>hole. Then I went stomping around the neighborhood.Â </p><p>I was like, <em>Nah, there is no way. There is no way I didnâ€™t make this team.</em></p><p>Honestly, it brought down my confidence a lot.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-204085e1986c2f47574577b88012619d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Devin Vassell"><figcaption>Courtesy of Devin Vassell</figcaption></figure><p>And if it wasnâ€™t bad enough that I didnâ€™t make the team, the assistant coach was also my social studies teacher. So I had to see this man every day after that!!! Heâ€™s asking the class about British parliament or whatever and Iâ€™m just steaming.</p><p>I finished out the school year, and that summer, I transferred schools. I went to our rival school.</p><p>When I was a sophomore at Peachtree Ridge High, and my first varsity game came against those kids at my old school whoâ€™d made the team ahead of me just a few years before, I was a skinny kid with a point to prove.</p><p>But as soon as I walk in the gym, Iâ€™m already sick to my stomach. Iâ€™m thinking, <em>Iâ€™m finally here. Iâ€™m in front of all these people that knew me at my old middle schools.</em></p><p>And when I came out of the tunnel, everybody started <em>booing</em>.</p><p>Like, â€œBoo, Devin!â€Â </p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>That was my reaction. â€œOh.â€</p><p>Coach says, â€œAlright, Devin, itâ€™s time for you to go in,â€ and my heart starts pounding.</p><p>I get in the game, and Iâ€™m playing my role. Whole time, the crowd straight <em>trashing </em>me. Just talking a whole bunch of mess.</p><p>We come down the court, and I spot up in the corner. They pass the ball to me.</p><p>The <em>clank</em> of a brick means you at least got close. You hit the rim. But I didnâ€™t even do that. I airballed in front of all those people who knew me from before and were waiting for me to fail.</p><p>I said, â€œOh, no. Oh, no.â€</p><blockquote>When I came out of the tunnel, everybody started booing.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>A couple of minutes later, my rotation was still playing. The crowd still talking mess.Â </p><p>I get it again, same corner. Another air ball.</p><p>Iâ€™m thinking, <em>Oh no, get me out of here, Coach.</em></p><p>We ended up winning the game, but I bombed hard. I donâ€™t think I even attempted to shoot the rest of that game.</p><p>But after that year, every single time we played them, it was wraps for them. I was <em>good</em> after that. I just needed to shake off the nerves.</p><hr /><p>I think everybody whoâ€™s ever tried to be really great at something has a story like that. They had a game where they just ... werenâ€™t good. I know I probably have a few more of those moments to look forward to in my NBA career.</p><p>But those moments are learning opportunities. I know that no matter what exactly is ahead of me, there are going to be ups and there are going to be downs, both on and off the court.</p><p>Iâ€™ve already dealt with some of that. Some of the biggest challenges Iâ€™ve faced, people donâ€™t even know about.</p><p>When I was around sixth and seventh grade, my family was going through some things. I donâ€™t like to talk too much about whatâ€™s going on in my private life. I keep everything in-house, especially when it comes to family stuff.</p><p>But one of the greatest challenges Iâ€™ve faced in my life was back then, when my mom had been having severe back issues and had to go through surgeries and stuff like that. She had been a nurse up to that point and used to work long hours, but she couldnâ€™t work anymore and had to go on disability.Â </p><p>Just seeing her sometimes not feeling her best was very tough on me mentally as a kid. Maybe more than I even realized.</p><p>Seeing that it wasnâ€™t as easy for her to do some stuff anymore, like getting out of the car, or just walking around â€” when that kind of thing happens to someone thatâ€™s very important in your life, it can take a toll.</p><p>But my mom is one of the strongest people on the planet, and with her being as strong as she is, it just became motivation for me. It was motivation for us all, as a family.</p><p>Iâ€™m lucky to be close with both of my parents, and theyâ€™ve really tried to prepare me for everything thatâ€™s ahead of me. Weâ€™ve had a lot of talks, but mainly their message has been to stay grounded. They told me, â€œBe who you are, stay humble, and remember where you came from.â€</p><p>Iâ€™ll never forget those lessons.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SlfRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAARAAABA-07585905882adfbb09343672e7eccb2f.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Mark Wallheiser/AP Photo"><figcaption>Mark Wallheiser/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>And I wonâ€™t forget that no matter whether I won or lost, or when I didnâ€™t make the team, they never stopped believing in my dream.</p><p>Thereâ€™s still so much more that I have left to prove. Iâ€™ll always have that mindset. Thatâ€™s not going to go away, no matter the success, no matter whatâ€™s going on in my life.Â </p><p>I think that just growing up my whole life and not being ranked, not getting some of the credit or recognition I feel like I deserved, it definitely stays with me.</p><p>But it also makes this moment â€” right now, as I prepare for draft night â€” that much more of a blessing.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s a blessing to be where Iâ€™m at, and Iâ€™ll never take that for granted.</p><hr /><p>Alright, one last story. March 2019, ACC tournament quarterfinals. FSU vs. Virginia Tech.</p><p>Weâ€™re down three, with about seven seconds left in the game.</p><p>I was on a hot streak and had made three of five three-pointers.Â </p><p>Everybody had been telling me, â€œYouâ€™re hot, youâ€™re hot. Keep shooting if you get open.â€Â </p><p>So now, weâ€™re in the huddle. A play is called. Iâ€™m in the game, but the play isnâ€™t just for me â€” there are options. Trent Forrest was inbounding, and there was somebody wide open, right next to him.Â </p><p>But when we came out the huddle, I said, â€œBro, listen, if you pass it to me, Iâ€™m shooting it.â€Â </p><p>He looked at me. I said, â€œIf you pass it to me, Iâ€™m shooting it. So take it for what you want.â€</p><p>And he was just like, â€œAlright.â€</p><p>So, Trent gets up to the line, and he looks. He sees me come up the screen and just <em>darts</em> it to me.</p><p>I come off of a flare screen to the corner and hit the three, with a hand in the face.Â </p><p>I looked back at Trent and said, â€œWell, I told you.â€</p><p>We ended up winning in overtime. And the craziest thing about it all wasnâ€™t even the hot streak I went on that night. It was that they came to the freshman.</p><p>They came to a freshman for that. Itâ€™s just the fact that they had that much confidence in me. Not only the coaches, but my teammates.Â </p><p>It was huge. It meant everything.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SaTRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADgEAA-536672a47f4f1a595d5259be5991382e.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Tori Lynn Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat"><figcaption>Tori Lynn Schneider/Tallahassee Democrat</figcaption></figure><p>When I was younger, my goal was always to be one and done, always. Elementary school, I was like <em>Yeah, Iâ€™m going to be at the McDonald&#39;s game. One and done. Itâ€™s wraps.Â </em></p><p>Then when I got offered by Florida State they told me that Iâ€™d probably have to redshirt my first year. So all that went out the window. But I just told myself, I said, <em>Iâ€™m going to go to Florida State for two years. Iâ€™ll be there for two years, and then Iâ€™m gone.</em></p><p>I kept that to myself. I told my parents, and my close friends, and that was it.Â </p><p>But I stayed in my role and didnâ€™t step on nobodyâ€™s toes â€” and I just kept working.</p><p>People are gonna tell you that youâ€™re not gonna make it because you might not be the biggest. You might not be the fastest. You might not be the strongest. They might even want you to be the team manager.</p><p>But it doesnâ€™t matter if you put in the work.</p><p>I just put it in the work and stuck to my dream.</p><p>Everything Iâ€™ve ever done, every experience Iâ€™ve ever had, every challenge Iâ€™ve ever faced, has led me to this moment.Â </p><p>And as I sit here writing this, in my blue 2020 NBA Draft Combine polo shirt, I want to remember it all.</p><p>When my sophomore year at FSU finally came around, I said to myself, <em>Well, you said you were only going to be here for two.Â </em></p><p>This is two.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s time.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-c4d86f089a1fb43bae949e7ba350f2df.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>To the city of Indianapolis, and to Pacers fans everywhereâ€¦..Â </p><p>Thank you so much for the warm welcome, for real. I read ALL of your messages last night â€” yâ€™all being excited has me excited.</p><p>Itâ€™s been a pretty wild journey for me to get to this pointâ€¦. and it kind of feels like one chapter is coming to a close now, while this other one is just beginning. And so I thought it might be a cool idea to write a few things down â€” just to mark the moment, in a way, and show my gratitude.Â </p><p>And maybe to help you get to know your 2020 Draft Pick a little bit.</p><p>Hereâ€™s a few thoughts on where Iâ€™m at, and what Iâ€™m about:</p><h3><strong>(1) I love sports.Â </strong></h3><p>No, I donâ€™t think you understand: I <em>love</em> sports. Iâ€™m obsessed with sports. Likeâ€¦.. Iâ€™m not one of these dudes who just had a growth spurt, realized he was 6&#39; 6&#34; or whatever, and then decided to give hooping a try.</p><p>Iâ€™m here, first and foremost, because basketball is what I live and breathe.</p><h3><strong>(2) One play Iâ€™m always proud of, that I think reflects who I am as a player, was in my junior year of high school â€” state semifinals.</strong></h3><p>So weâ€™re one game away from the California state championship, and weâ€™re down late. Itâ€™s all coming down to the final play. And letâ€™s be honest: a lot of people here are probably expecting me to tell a story about how I hit some game-winning shot.Â </p><p>But thatâ€™s not the case.</p><p>Nah. See, we had me on our team, and I was one of our leaders for sure â€” but we also had this guy Duane Washington, whoâ€™s a really good player (heâ€™s at Ohio State now). And my mentality in that moment was, listen: Iâ€™m always ready to take the big shot. But my <em>top</em> priority? Itâ€™s to make the winning play. And the way we figured it, drawing it up, with my athleticism and being able to see over the defense and whatnot, we were going to run a play with me as the full-court inbound passer, and my role was to hit Duane in the perfect spot for him to get in space for a bucket.</p><p>Basically the Grant Hill to Christian Laettner Play, right?? But I actually think ours was harder, because Duane was double-teamed. And I had to basically drop a dime, right in his hands, over two defenders. (You know what, maybe it was more like Kyler to D-Hop.) Anyway â€” I hit that pass, Duane hit his shot, we tied it up, won in 2OT, and went on to a state title.</p><blockquote>Iâ€™m always ready to take the big shot. But my top priority? Itâ€™s to make the winning play.<cite></cite></blockquote><h3><strong>(3) I know my history.Â </strong></h3><p>If you think Iâ€™m too young to be referencing Grant Hill to Christian Laettner â€” youâ€™re right. That play happened seven years before I was born. But at the same time, a classic like that, itâ€™s kind of a good way for me to show you what Iâ€™m about. Because Iâ€™m all about respecting the classics. Iâ€™m all about learning from my OGs.</p><p>I grew up being the type of kid whose idea of a fun night could easily just be watching the replay of an old NBA game â€” and Iâ€™m still that way. The other night, I was watching some random Bulls vs. Hawks matchup from the late 1980sâ€¦. and it blew me away. Of course, real heads, they already know why: late â€™80s Bulls vs. Hawks meansÂ <em>Michael vs. Dominique.</em></p><p>It was unbelievable. Those dudes were at the absolute peak of their powers, and they just <em>went at it,</em> tip to buzzer.</p><p>It was like the type of battles youâ€™d have with your friends in the driveway, growing up â€” when itâ€™s first to 21, youâ€™re going shot for shot, and itâ€™s WAR. Only this was on that NBA stage. Levels and levels to greatness.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-9ffcf575f866a965de5677deea2af059.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Walter Iooss Jr./Sports Illustrated via Getty Images"><figcaption>Walter Iooss Jr./Sports Illustrated via Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>(4) Actually, while Iâ€™ve got this platform, I have a hot take for you all.Â </strong></h3><p><em>Last Dance</em> era Mike? He was nice. I mean, he was more than nice â€” late-â€™90s Mike is about as iconic as it gets. But still Iâ€™ll tell you what: late-<em>â€™80s </em>MJ?? Young, wiry Mike?? That might be my favorite version of the man. That might be the GOATâ€™s GOAT era.</p><p>Itâ€™s <em>crazy</em>, the stuff that Michael was pulling off. One thing I noticed is how efficient he was with the ball. Sometimes it would be two dribbles to his spot and then elevation. Or it would be three dribbles, direct to the rim. Maybe one quick in-and-out, or one crossover, max â€” but even those moves, every time, you could tell he was setting up his finish.</p><blockquote>Late-â€™80s MJ?? Young, wiry Mike?? That might be my favorite version of the man.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>And thatâ€™s been a really big lesson for me, from watching Michael in his younger years, that Iâ€™m trying to emulate: A lot of people, they see one scouting report on you, and they write you off as all flash. â€œJust an athlete.â€ But I think Iâ€™m going to be able to show people that athleticism like I have can be a weapon in surprising ways. It can be something that helps with efficiency on both ends of the court.</p><h3><strong>(5) Thereâ€™s this rumor going around that I started dunking in ninth grade â€” but itâ€™s not true.</strong></h3><p>I started dunking in sixth grade.Â </p><p>Well, <em>technically</em> it was the summer before seventh grade. A couple of days before orientation.Â </p><p>I think it was a situation where, like, they needed a few volunteers to pop into school that day to help set things up. So I was hanging around the gym doing my volunteer thing, Iâ€™m in my Sierra Canyon â€œuniformâ€ â€” collared shirt + khaki shorts (no board shorts) + Vans â€” and of course you know thereâ€™s a ball out. And itâ€™s a bunch of us just messing around.</p><p>O.K. so backtrack for one second: I had this <em>thing</em>, I donâ€™t even know how or why it started, where I was just like â€” one of my big goals was to dunk before I started middle school. I wanted that so bad. So for all of sixth grade, and the summer before seventh grade, that had been one of the main things Iâ€™d get up to. Trying and trying to dunk. But pretty much all my tries up to that point were ending the same: <em>clank</em>, in and out, almost like an invisible hand was stuffing me at the rim. Like I was a few inches short, but I might as well have been a few feet short. It was a struggle.</p><p>Until it wasnâ€™t.Â </p><p>I have no idea what was different about that day. Maybe I grew overnight, or I had a little extra cereal for breakfast, orâ€¦.. I donâ€™t know. All I know is, it was this bunch of us in the gym hanging out, I picked up the ball and I hit my stride, and then â€” <em>BAM.</em></p><p>O.K. â€” so it wasnâ€™t Zach LaVine in the Dunk Contest or anything. But in my head?? In my head it was like a 97, easy. Maybe a 98. In my head it was <em>clean</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdwAAAPo-c266b9cca6a66deb7b7c53d13f7ce5d2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Cassius Stanley"><figcaption>Courtesy of Cassius Stanley</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™s funny, people are always asking me for advice on how to dunk better. Or jump higher. How to add those inches to their vertical. And itâ€™s just likeâ€¦.. have you ever been in a math class, and the teacher is writing some complex equation on the board, and your brain&#39;s going,Â <em>Excuse me? WHAT?? </em>Like you know you did the homework and everything, and youâ€™re not bad at math, but, <em>nah.</em> No way. That thing on the board canâ€™t be real. It makes zero sense. And then you turn to your right and the kid at the next deskâ€¦.. he hasnâ€™t just already finished it. Heâ€™s obliterated it. And youâ€™re like, â€œBro â€” howâ€™d you <em>do</em> that?? Howâ€™d you solve that equation??â€ And he tells you, like, â€œI canâ€™t really explain it. Honestly I just kind of <em>did it,</em> you know? It was easy.â€</p><p>Alright well thatâ€™s like me and dunking. For most people, with dunking, itâ€™s like they see a bunch of confusing numbers on the board and it will never make sense.</p><p>For me? Itâ€™s easy.</p><p>I just kind of obliterate it.</p><p>I just <em>dunk.</em></p><h3><strong>(6) Oh yeah and then one other funny thing about that.</strong></h3><p>My mom is an insane athlete. Actually, check that â€” she was a <em>heptathlete</em>. For those who donâ€™t know the heptathlon, itâ€™s seven events: hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200m sprint, long jump, javelin, and 800m run. Itâ€™s beyond legit. And like I said, my mom was insane. She was an All-America at UCLA, and competed at a world-class level. Itâ€™s wild. My mom was a legend in the game.</p><p>And then my dad is a sports agent. And I love my dad to death â€” I could spend hours bragging about him, and heâ€™s a legend in his own game, for sure. But I wonâ€™t lie: He couldnâ€™t jump over a piece of paper.</p><p>So itâ€™s just kind of hilarious, because, likeâ€¦.. it doesnâ€™t take a genius to see that I got my jumping ability, and my athleticism in general, from my mom. But for whatever reason, I think because people have all of these gender biases, itâ€™s like they canâ€™t wrap their heads around that. So people are always looking at my dad â€” who is about 6&#39; 1&#34; and dresses like a DAD, if you know what I mean â€” and theyâ€™re always like, â€œHuh. So, what, did your dadâ€¦.. he play in the league? Or he play college ball? Orâ€¦..â€ And itâ€™s like, ha. No!! Canâ€™t jump, canâ€™t hoop. Thanks for asking.</p><p>Meanwhile, my mom was on the damn ALL AMERICA squad â€” and no one ever asks me a thing.</p><p>Check your bias, people!!!!!</p><p>And Mom, thanks for the hops.</p><h3><strong>(7) Iâ€™m proud of my Los Angeles roots.</strong></h3><p>I think at this point in our history, the proof is just in the names.Â </p><p>The LA-area roll call is <em>deep</em>: Russ. Harden. DeMar. Taurasi. Lonzo. The Holiday Bros. Jordin Canada. Zach LaVine. Paul George. OGs like Baron. Cheryl and Reggie. Tyson Chandler. Lisa Leslie. Paul Pierce. Cynthia Cooper. Gil. Nick Young. And then you have new blood like myself, Onyeka, LaMelo, and it goes on. Plus plenty of talent coming up behind us, in the high school and college ranks. (Shoutout to my guy Josh Christopher over at Arizona State. Remember the name.)</p><p>And whether itâ€™s training together, or crossing paths and building relationships in Drew League, or helping out the generation behind you, the bonds that stay holding LA basketball together are real. For example, and I wonâ€™t speak on this too much because I know he doesnâ€™t do it for the attention, but, manâ€¦.. would I be in the spot Iâ€™m in right now, having just gotten drafted to the league, if Russ hadnâ€™t taken me under his wing? If he hadnâ€™t gone out of his way to mentor me, and train with me, and look out for me? I donâ€™t know.</p><p>And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m so grateful, and so proud to be a part of this lineage.Â </p><p>And itâ€™s why I expect a lot out of myself â€” both to pay it forward when itâ€™s my turn, and to play a type of basketball that might make me worthy of waving the flag for our city.</p><h3><strong>(8) Probably the thing thatâ€™s helped me most to get through this Draft process â€” itâ€™s a piece of advice I got from Coach K.Â </strong></h3><p>What happened wasâ€¦.. well, itâ€™s interesting.</p><p>After I jumped 44 inches at the combine, thatâ€™s a number thatâ€™s kind of stuck with me.Â </p><p>Everyone wants to bring it up. First thing Iâ€™ll get questions on in any interview. <em>Third-highest combine number since 2000,</em> and so on. And I think for a lot of people, a number like that, it can kind of be this albatross. They canâ€™t get free of that number, and then it sort of messes with their head. It can become this way to almost marginalize them: <em>Youâ€™re just a jumper, </em>or <em>Youâ€™re a one dimensional player,</em> or stuff like that.</p><p>But <em>hereâ€™s</em> why you go to Duke, man.</p><p>Hereâ€™s why you go to Duke: <em>I already went through this once.</em> Kind of insane, but itâ€™s true. Early on last fall at Duke, before Media Day in the preseason, I guess people found out that Iâ€™d broken Zionâ€™s maximum vertical record. I jumped 46 inches as a freshman. And everyoneâ€™s going <em>crazy</em> about it, right? So of course with Media Day coming, itâ€™s all anyone is going to ask me about.</p><p>Coach K, though, knowing that, and knowing I think how it could potentially have these negative effects on me, he took me aside. And the line Iâ€™ll never forget that he said to me is, he just goes â€” â€œCassius, thatâ€™s not an <em>empty</em> number.â€ And basically what Coach meant by that is, â€œ46â€.... thatâ€™s not some piece of trivia. Thatâ€™s not some show number. Itâ€™s not a â€œ12 guys in the gym and youâ€™re touching a stickâ€ number. Thatâ€™s a <em>real</em> number. Itâ€™s a <em>productive</em> number. â€œ46â€ means you can rebound like hell from the guard spot, when the other team thinks youâ€™re boxed out. â€œ46â€ means you can close out on a shooter that much faster, that much higher, that much <em>more</em>. â€œ46â€ means that where other guys are taking low-percentage floaters and tough-angle layups, youâ€™re playing above the rim at a high percentage. Youâ€™re playing the attack angles. Youâ€™re playing to win.</p><p>In other words: â€œ46,â€ â€œ44,â€ those arenâ€™t workout numbers â€” theyâ€™re <em>basketball</em> numbers.</p><p>And I donâ€™t jump to jump.</p><p>I jump to win basketball games.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4AAQSkZJRgABAQEASABIAAD7V28UG-67c5304ca5d25890c31b51fd26836c18.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Grant Halverson/Getty Images"><figcaption>Grant Halverson/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>(9) LETâ€™S GO, INDY.</strong></h3><p>Like I said at the top â€” this is an ending for me, but itâ€™s also a beginning. And I canâ€™t even tell you how excited I am for what this beginning represents. I canâ€™t even tell you how excited I am to become a part of this community, and to earn my spot on this Pacers roster.</p><p>And as soon as I started hearing from yâ€™all fans last nightâ€¦.. I knew I was in the right place.</p><p>I think thatâ€™s a good note to end this on.</p><p>Thanks for reading â€” and thanks for the opportunity of a lifetime.</p><p>Iâ€™m here to work and Iâ€™m here to win.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-e3061b99e46cac9e00b24d1c398daab7.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The epitome of consistency, a College Station legend and Harry Potterâ€™s biggest fan, Mike Evans drops by to chat with the fellas on <em>Truss Levelz</em>. We hear how Mike held up during the offseason. TLDR: Just fine. Then we go back to the beginning and hear about how he was supposed to be hooper until football interfered with that whole plan. Youâ€™ll hear who his best opponent in high was and how he chose Texas A&amp;M. Life as an Aggie and the easy decision to go pro. He plays coy about catching passes this offseason with THE GOAT, TB12. But opens up about life and family, and yes, his unabiding love for Harry Potter. #wandlife. Mike reveals what house the Sorting Hat would place him in and how he would fare on the Quidditch pitch. He makes a strong case for why he would not just be a good Seeker, but a Viktor Krum-level Golden Snitch snatcher. (Editorâ€™s note: thatâ€™s a stretch. But Mike Evans would definitely give Maximus Brankovitch III a run for his money.) We hear about his experience on a private jet, food picks in Paris and his pregame playlist. Mike is one of the best in the game right now and this episode is one you canâ€™t miss. Listen up. Big Truss. BIG.Â </p><hr />]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear Marv, Mareon, Murrell and Mya,</p><p>I have something to tell you. Something I want to talk about.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s something Iâ€™ve mostly kept to myself up to now, and you might not fully understand it right at this moment, but I need for you to hear it.</p><p>Itâ€™s tough to talk about even all these months later, but after your little brother Marlo passed away in Decemberâ€¦.</p><p>Daddy was ready to call it quits.</p><p>Not just football, either. Iâ€™m talking just get away from â€¦ <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Leave the country. Move to Spain. Hunker down. Just us and Mommy. That sort of thing. Never talk to anyone ever again, never have to face anyone or discuss anything, just shield us all from the entire outside world. You know what I mean?</p><p>We were all just struggling so much.</p><p>Mom and me was one thing, but hearing Mya ask, â€œWhen is Marlo coming back down from heaven?â€ Seeing that teddy bear that you guys called by his name? It was beyond heartbreaking.</p><p>We always told you guys it was O.K. to cry and to let your feelings out.</p><p>But sometimes thatâ€™s not so easy. Even for Dad.</p><p>Me and Mommy tried our best to stay strong in front of you guys, and to make sure you understood that we were going to get through this no matter what. We knew youâ€™d be watching us â€” looking to us for how we were handling such an unimaginable tragedy. So we did our best. But the reality is.â€¦</p><p>I was really hurting.</p><p>Early on Iâ€™d try to act â€œnormalâ€ all day and not show any hurt, and then Iâ€™d just lie down in bed at night and itâ€™d all come out at once. So, yeah, those first few days, it all just felt like too much.</p><p>But thatâ€™s not what I wanted to tell you.</p><p>I mention all that stuff because I need you to understand the backdrop for what I <em>do</em> want to talk about. And that isâ€¦.</p><p>What happened next.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-58e022ce7f5ed12921e601bba9749d6d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr."><figcaption>Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr.</figcaption></figure><p>A few days after our little angel left us, as sad as we all were â€¦ something truly amazing happened. Something inspiring.</p><p>And thatâ€™s actually what I want to tell you about.</p><p>All of sudden, folks just kept showing up at our front door. And, at first, I gotta be honest ... I didnâ€™t want to answer. But the doorbell just kept ringing.</p><p>Matthew and Kelly Stafford.</p><p>Danny Amendola.</p><p>Kenny Golladay.</p><p>Coach Patricia. Coach Prince. Other members of the organization.Â </p><p>All showing us love. Giving us support. Letting us know that they were there for us.</p><p>I mean, you guys ... it was so moving what they did for our family.</p><p>Iâ€™m getting choked up right now just sitting here writing about it. But back then? In that moment? Iâ€™m not lying when I say that their visits, that supportâ€¦.</p><p>It changed something inside of me.</p><p>I went from wanting to be closed off and isolated from pretty much everyone to realizing beyond a shadow of a doubt that our family needed all the love and support we could get.</p><p>So after those first few visits, our door was wide open. You guys remember it. Everyone in the family flew up to Michigan. Your grandparents, aunts and uncles on both sides. Auntie Leslie even flew in from China.</p><p>Everyone rallied around us.</p><p>And as tough as those first few days were, I always want you guys to remember how our family and friends came together to lift us up and help us all get through the most difficult experience of our lives.</p><p>Local businesses and restaurants sent over food and care packages. Police and firefighters stopped by to lend their support. Friends, sports fans, and just regular folks from all around the world sent us their well-wishes and shared their stories of loss with us to make sure we knew we werenâ€™t alone.Â </p><p>It was powerful. And it goes to show something I want you guys to always rememberâ€¦.Â </p><p>It really does take a community sometimes. Sometimes you canâ€™t do things on your own.</p><p>People need people.</p><blockquote>It really does take a community sometimes. Sometimes you canâ€™t do things on your own. People need people.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>The other big point to remember â€” and this is maybe the most important thing of all in terms of your lives going forward â€” is that the good people in this world outnumber the bad by a wide margin. Those who are kindhearted and eager to lend a hand â€¦ those folks are everywhere.</p><p>Please never doubt that for a second.Â </p><p>I know itâ€™s sometimes easy to get down about the negativity and hatred and pessimism that we see online or on the news, but those people, that mindset? When push comes to shove â€¦ it has no chance against the good people of the world.</p><p>When something like what happened to us takes place, you learn that real quick.</p><p>But the important thing is that <em>you never forget it</em>.</p><p>That you never stop letting it inspire you to show that same love and compassion throughout your own lives. I can tell you for certain that the kindness and support that our family received made a lasting impact on Mommy and me.</p><p>Your mom is in the process of starting up a foundation that will help other families who have gone through what we all experienced over the past year â€” a place for sharing stories, and where families can lend support to one another.</p><p>And the outpouring of support we experienced over this past year definitely inspired us to want to do even more once the pandemic hit. Daddy looked at himself in the mirror and asked, <em>Am I doing enough to help right now?</em> Mommy did the same. And we both agreed that we needed to do all that we could to support first responders and everyone else putting their own health and well-being on the line for the rest of us. We wanted to do our part to let those folks know that <em>they</em> were not alone, and that we all had their backs, and to help them feel the same power of community that had lifted us up over the past year.</p><p>Iâ€™m so proud that you guys were with us for every step of that journey, and the joy and happiness that you each experienced from helping others is something that will be in my heart forever.</p><p>It was inspiring for me.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-6aa0304176b491a6b8abd6fc36fc525d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr."><figcaption>Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr.</figcaption></figure><p>At the same time, while the struggles and suffering of the coronavirus pandemic were going down, we all couldnâ€™t help but look for silver linings wherever we could find them. And as heartbreaking as the pandemic has been on so many levels, I have to say that I am grateful that it has allowed our family to be together for an extended period of time â€” and at a moment when I truly believe that we needed that more than ever.</p><p>After your brotherâ€™s passing, we absolutely needed to be together like that, we really, really did. And for your mom and me, being able to spend so much time with you guys was a blessing.</p><p>Believe me when I tell you, every moment together this year has been cherished.</p><p>To the fullest.</p><p>Often people tend to think that the parents do everything for their kids, and teach all the lessons and set the standard, but in so many ways, it was actually <em>your</em> resilience and strength and positivity that helped <em>us</em> get through this year.Â </p><p>And at the end of the day we all made it through <em>together</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-6335d3ce4f4336c7e5e2ccc464e94627.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr."><figcaption>Courtesy of Marvin Jones Jr.</figcaption></figure><p>I donâ€™t want to go on too long â€” I know for a fact that a few of you have Zoom homework assignments to get to! â€” but before I get out of here, there are just two last things I want to make sure you understand.</p><p>First, please know that during the past year you guys have brought an immense amount of joy into Mommy and Daddyâ€™s lives. Even in the hardest of times, you allowed us to see and experience what real, pure love looks like.</p><p>Sometimes us grown-ups make life so complicated, and get caught up in our jobs, or all the other things that we need to take care of from day to day. But you guys, you brought Mom and me back to our childhoods this year. Just watching you run around and jump and laugh, and then doing all those things right alongside you guys â€¦ it really was the best.</p><p>Everything became so simple and genuine and pure. You guys made it all about love, and appreciating our time together, and that really put everything in perspective for us. I canâ€™t tell you how much that meant to me and Mommy.</p><p>It was like we were both 12 again â€” playing kickball in the house, trying to remember the rules of handball, having epic Barbie doll playdates, doing double Dutch (DOUBLE DUTCH!!!) together. All of a sudden, we were back in the â€™90s.</p><p>And you guys had us laughing and smiling again.</p><p>Heck, Marv even taught me how to make TikToks!</p><p>At one point I remember pulling your mom aside and whispering, â€œAre these our kids or our siblings?â€</p><p>Because we were all having so much fun together.</p><blockquote>You guys, you brought Mom and me back to our childhoods this year.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Of course, weâ€™ll never ever forget Marlo. Weâ€™ll always remember the wonderful times we had together with him. And I know heâ€™s been smiling down on us from heaven while weâ€™ve been doing all that stuff together. I know heâ€™s proud of you guys, and he surely knows how much of a difference you made in helping your parents cope this year.</p><p>So on behalf of both Mom and I, and your baby brother Marlo, I just want to sayâ€¦.</p><p>Thank you.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-13ee366ea591b435f59f3f17bbe9ca80.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Detroit Lions/AP Images"><figcaption>Detroit Lions/AP Images</figcaption></figure><p>And last, but certainly not least, I just want to say that Mommy and me are so excited for you guys to meet the newest member of our family.</p><p>After Marlo was born, your mom and I had decided that there werenâ€™t going to be any additional brothers or sisters joining our family. But after his passing ... you guys let it be known that you had other ideas.Â Â </p><p>And, I mean â€¦ how could we ignore that?</p><p>It was probably the fastest and easiest change of plans in the history of the world.</p><p>And now, when your baby sister arrives in February, you guys can know that she is here because of Marlo, and because of what he meant to you guys. What he <em>still means</em> to all of us.</p><p>Your baby sister will be another of about a million reminders of how special Marlo was.</p><p>And, you know what elseâ€¦? She is going to be joining one heck of a family!</p><p>With all my love,</p><p>Daddy</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACnYAAAXj-a24c6578ed480a409f293e56cf4445e2.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Dear 29-year-old Mike,</p><p>I got to let you know something before you go out there for triple overtime in Buffalo.</p><p>I know, I know, youâ€™ve got to be out on the ice with your guys. But youâ€™re going to want to hear this. Because youâ€™re about to go through one of the most amazing, important times in your life. And when it ends, those memories are going to last forever.</p><p>So know this: That feeling you have, deep down, thatâ€™s telling you itâ€™s going to be really, really tough to bounce back if this thing goes seven? That feeling is the truth. Youâ€™ve got a broken wrist that youâ€™re numbing every day and praying that it doesnâ€™t get worse each shift. Hullâ€™s on a bad knee and heâ€™s probably not suiting up for Game 7. The boys in the room are out of gas. This is it. This is <em>really </em>it.</p><p>You could have never dreamed of whatâ€™s on the other side of this period.</p><p>I mean, do you remember clearing off the snow on the lake that you used to live on outside of Detroit?</p><p>Do you remember how this all began?</p><p>Dad taught you how to skate out there when you were six years old and, man, once you got started there was no going back. You knew right away that you just loved to skate. Then you moved off the lake, so Mom built you a little rink in the backyard in the winters and you were out there basically every waking hour. And the funny thing is, you didnâ€™t even know a lick about the sport, really.</p><p>When you were five, and Dad was working his construction job, he had a talk with a few of the boys he hired to help him. They were the Rankin brothers. Jack, Mike and Bobby Rankin. Jack played some semipro hockey in his day and Bobby played in college up at St. Lawrence.</p><p>Dad told them that you had too much energy. Like way too much energy. You were always getting up to no good around the house and bothering Mom. At Kindergarten class, the teachers would complain that youâ€™d never pay attention like the other kids did and you always had to be doing something.</p><p>So Dad and the Rankin boys had an idea to keep you moving.</p><p>Hockey.</p><p>They thought that if they strapped some skates on you, you could make something of all that energy.</p><p>You understood, right away, what they were thinking. Once you got outside, and you skated in the open air on the lake â€¦ you were hooked. That feeling of the cold wind hitting your face harder and harder the faster you go drew you back out there every day.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RhXRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-44ed252a3c2e5edfadfb2b5a0f8e7962.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Mike Modano"><figcaption>Courtesy of Mike Modano</figcaption></figure><p>As you got older, you started to discover that the sport exists outside of your backyard. You and Dad would watch channel nine on Saturday nights to see those great Toronto and Montreal teams play. Sittler, Salming for the Leafs. Lafleur, Robinson for the Habs. These guys lit up on the TV. And since Dad was from Boston, on family vacations up there during the holidays, youâ€™d go to the Garden with him and see the Bruins play. The electricity in the building stayed with you long after you left.</p><p>Back home, it was just a 30-minute drive to the Joe in Detroit, where the Wings played. They were going through a tough stretch back when you were a boy. But the fans in town always had a great passion for their team. Hockey, in that part of our country, meant a lot to everyone. And the Wings gave back to their community in a bunch of different ways. You were part of that when you started going to Little Caesars hockey camps when you were 10. That took the game to a whole new level for you.</p><p>Through those camps, you were able to see more games at the Joe and fall in love with the sport even more. You began to compete against some of the best players in the area, and that led to a tough decision.</p><p>One thing a lot of people donâ€™t know is that you thought about trying to make it in tennis. You were a pretty good player as a boy, and for a bit you considered going to Florida to try and really give it a run in tennis.</p><p>Mike Modano, the tennis pro. Maybe in another life. </p><p>But in this life, you chased that feeling of freedom that only hockey could give you. That led to you, Mom and Dad making another big choice. Going to Canada for juniors was the best option if you were going to try and make it to the NHL. But it was a big choice. Mom was a bit hesitant to send you up there, especially because you were only 16.</p><p>Rick Wilson, the head coach of the Prince Albert Raiders in Saskatchewan called you up in the summer of â€™86, telling you how he wanted you to come up there and what he believed was possible for you. There was no changing your mind after that.</p><blockquote>But in this life, you chased that feeling of freedom that only hockey could give you.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Do you remember how confident you were in the decision?</p><p>Mom and Dad â€” though they wanted a few more years of you at home â€” knew it was the right call, too.</p><p>In Prince Albert, youâ€™d meet two of the most important people youâ€™d ever come across.</p><p>Ralph and Carol Ring, your billet family.</p><p>One of their sons, Martin, had just moved out, but Stephen was still there. They made your transition from Livonia to your new home as easy as you could have ever imagined. Ralph worked as an executive with the Raiders and Carol worked in city hall, but she would sing the anthem before games. They, like everyone in the town, had a deep connection to the team. The Raiders were the heartbeat of Prince Albert.</p><p>Coach Wilson and his wife, who was also named Carol, were such great leaders for that team.</p><p>You know, itâ€™s funny, because when people think of you down the road, a lot of them are going to remember you for your skating. That will be a point of pride for you. But what they wonâ€™t know is that you were a bit of late bloomer when it came to really finding that explosive stride. It wasnâ€™t until Carol Wilson, who was a great figure skater, worked with you that you started to find that next level. She made your stride a bit longer and all of sudden you gained a step on some of the older kids playing in the WHL.</p><p>Thatâ€™s what people in Prince Albert do, they help one another.</p><p>It was a small farm town, but they loved their hockey. I mean, of course, the whole country of Canada did. The word <em>passionate</em> doesnâ€™t quite cover it. So when you got to town, there was definitely some push-back about an American being up there and scoring as many points as you did. I know you remember that part. Some of the other teams always had a few guys in their bottom six that wanted to take a run at you or remind you that you werenâ€™t at home anymore.</p><p>But you got through it. I know how much you loved Prince Albert once you got to know it. You spent summers up there and youâ€™ll keep in touch with those friends you made outside the rink for life.</p><p>In the summer of â€™87, you began to see what could happen when your time with the Raiders was done.</p><p>That year, the draft was at the Joe in Detroit. Even though you werenâ€™t eligible until the next year, you and Dad went to see what it was all about. A few of the guys you played against in the WHL got picked in the first round, including Joe Sakic. You lined up against him a couple of times the year before. He was a great player and you knew if you worked hard in your draft year, you could have a chance to go early in the first round, too.</p><p>That next season, you didnâ€™t hear much about the draft until after the world juniors ended in Moscow in January. You guys didnâ€™t have a great tournament, but when you got back home the NHL released the Central Scouting Bureau draft rankings, and you saw your name up at the top with Trevor Linden. </p><p>Hereâ€™s the thing about the draft, that you might not fully appreciate for some time: Going first overall will mean a lot to you â€” to American hockey â€” as you get older. I know, at the time, you just wanted to be an NHL player. But receiving the honor of being the second American to be selected first â€¦ thatâ€™s a big deal. Trevor was a great junior player, so to battle with him through the end of that â€™88 season will help you grow.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4R9LRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-099b18178146f8d4f036c48c38d7002e.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Bruce Bennett/Getty Images"><figcaption>Bruce Bennett/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>The draft was at the forum in Montreal. Your whole family was there with you, including Ralph and Carol.</p><p>I know you knew that it was likely youâ€™d go first or second, to Minnesota or Vancouver. But I also know you looked up and down that draft board and let your mind wander. You saw Pittsburgh had the fourth pick and you wondered, <em>A career playing beside Mario â€¦ what would that be like?</em></p><p>But when Lou Nanne made the call to take you first overall, youâ€™d learn that Minnesota was the place you wanted to be. That passion Michiganders have for hockey is matched by Minnesotans. And you were lucky to join a franchise like the North Stars.</p><p>The TSN interview after the pick, where you were sweaty and more nervous than youâ€™d ever been, wasnâ€™t your best. But at least your braces were off. Did you forget how you got them off a few weeks before? New teeth, new job. Pretty good week, I think.</p><p>After another year in Prince Albert, you finally had to say goodbye to the Rings and the Raiders. You headed to Kalamazoo for training camp with the North Stars in the summer of â€™89 and you learned, real quick, that the NHL was a big step up from the WHL. You walked into the locker room and saw guys like Brian Bellows, Stew Gavins and Basil McRae. You werenâ€™t in Saskatchewan anymore.</p><p>You also realized in your first practice that you werenâ€™t the fastest anymore.</p><p>That shook you a bit. But everyone in the room did a good job of welcoming you and making you feel a part of the team. That made your rookie season a bit easier.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RHiRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAASAAABA-5072c5e0f1be27eb32c6835f62a87074.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Bruce Bennett/Getty Images"><figcaption>Bruce Bennett/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>But, Mike, Iâ€™ve got a quick piece of advice for you here.</p><p>Donâ€™t get in another fight. Just donâ€™t do it. I know, I know, when you dropped the gloves with Rod Brindâ€™Amour that year, it made sense in the moment. But, yeah, he handled you pretty good. You did your best â€¦ but just donâ€™t look up the fight on the Internet when youâ€™re older either. That part of the game just isnâ€™t for you, pal.</p><p>In Minnesota, you grew into the player you always wanted to be. The Stanley Cup run in â€™91 taught you a lot about what it takes to win in this league. You guys snuck into the playoffs that year with 68 points, but you learned quickly that it doesnâ€™t matter how you got there â€” what matters is <em>that </em>youâ€™re there.</p><p>The fans in Minnesota packed the arena every night during those playoffs and you only lost one home game before the Cup final. That Pittsburgh team that you ran into, man, they were good, right? Mario, Jagr, Coffeyâ€¦. They could really play. They beat you guys in six, and it stung for a while. </p><p>I know you remember that feeling this year before you played Buffalo.Â </p><p>But, of course, thereâ€™s a big difference with this yearâ€™s team. You arenâ€™t playing for Minnesota anymore. The team moved to Dallas in 1993 and I know it wasnâ€™t easy on you to say goodbye to the people of Minnesota. You were one of the leaders on that team and those last few games at the Met Center were pretty emotional. I know seeing those little boys and girls in their North Stars gear â€” knowing they wonâ€™t have a team the next year â€” that hurt.</p><p>But hockey is a business sometimes, you know that.</p><p>Not many of the guys could really believe that theyâ€™d be heading to Texas, though.</p><p>Remember when they broke the news to the team.</p><p><em>Dallas? Really? Thatâ€™s Cowboy country. </em></p><p>They had won back-to-back Super Bowls the year you headed out there and it was pretty obvious that, no matter what you did, or what they did, they were going to be the front-page story. In a way it took some of the pressure off of you as players. You were able to do your thing and try to help build up a fan base however the team wanted because people were pretty new to the sport. America wasnâ€™t the hockey hotbed it is now. In â€™93 it had only been a couple years since the Gretzky trade so the southern half of the country was still coming around on the game.</p><p>But, you noticed right away how nearly every fan who made it to a game in those first few years left with a smile on their face. And they always wanted to come back for another one. Even though the team struggled a bit those first few years, you were all building something special down there.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4SIPRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgABwESA-47ab79b786de8ccb0de58aa874cd5966.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Darren Carroll/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images"><figcaption>Darren Carroll/Sports Illustrated/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Those Dallas fans are smart when it comes to their sports though, you saw that. After a couple of years of being there they wanted a winner. In â€™96, when things werenâ€™t going so well, Ken Hitchcock came in to coach the team and things began to change, almost immediately. He pushed you hard. There were times when guys in the room would look at each other like, <em>Can this guy just relax for a day?</em></p><p>But that was Hitch.</p><p>That summer after he came in, you sat with him and Bob Gainey, the GM, and you worked out how you could help this team get over the hill and bring a Cup to Dallas. You all decided that it would be best to add some more dimensions to your game, to make you a 200-foot player and those types of responsibilities would be given to all the veterans on the team.</p><p>You know, when you look back on how the â€™99 Cup run came to be, youâ€™ll remember the preseason trips to Vail. When Hitch took over, he made those trips to Colorado mandatory before the season started and it really helped all the guys get to know each other. There was a lot of bonding, training and a bit of golf, too. That trip in â€™99, everyone knew before the season started that the team had to make a deep run that year. The fans in Dallas were hungry and they knew you and the team were capable of getting it done.</p><p>You saw how the team shaped up that year. You knew going into the playoffs that this was going to be special. From the veterans in the room like Brett Hull and Guy Carbonneau, to leaders like Derian Hatcher and Joe Nieuwendyk and all the way through the lineup to Ed Belfour in net â€” this group was built to win big games. You just had to prove it.</p><blockquote>When you look back on how the â€™99 Cup run came to be, youâ€™ll remember the preseason trips to Vail.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>In the Conference Finals you played that great Avalanche team with the guy you saw in â€™87 at the draft, Joe Sakic. They were an excellent group and after they beat you at home in Game 5, you were down 3â€“2. Those next two games, and you know this, they were some of the best hockey youâ€™ve ever been a part of. From top to bottom Hitch had you guys executing in every zone, on every shift. To go back to Colorado and win there, then to survive a Game 7â€¦. Iâ€™m sure it felt like destiny that you would beat Buffalo in the finals.</p><p>But now youâ€™re here. In the locker room of the Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo, and itâ€™s getting late.</p><p>Itâ€™s Game 6. Youâ€™re up 3â€“2 in the series. And youâ€™re about to head out there for triple overtime.</p><p>Look around. You see how beat the guys are?</p><p>Look at Hitch. He even looks tired.</p><p>But, man, this is it.</p><p>When you get out there, just try to get the puck in their zone. Thatâ€™s the first step. Theyâ€™ve got an incredible goalie in Hasek. Heâ€™s on tonight. Youâ€™ve got to get some traffic in front of him and make him work. As the period goes on, just try to cycle it and make them skate as much as possible.</p><p>Late in the frame, when the body is hurting the most, thatâ€™s when youâ€™ll get your chance.</p><p>Youâ€™ll get the puck in the corner, youâ€™ll shake free of Zhitnik and try to play along the wall. The puck will sort of fumble toward the net, so stay with it. Hully will be out there with you and itâ€™ll be one of his first shifts in a while because of his knee. Heâ€™ll be near the crease and then itâ€™s just going to happen.</p><p>Itâ€™ll be a blur. No matter how much detail I describe it to you in, itâ€™s going to be a blur.</p><p>Youâ€™ll be trying to get the puck and next thing you know, Hasek will be on his stomach and Hully will be screaming.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4RxQRXhpZgAATU0AKgAAAAgADwEAA-3d5ceb7ca76bd4ab408f4185ab9f2769.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Gene J. Puskar/AP Photo"><figcaption>Gene J. Puskar/AP Photo</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™s not going to take two days or two weeks for it to hit you that you won the Stanley Cup â€”<strong> </strong>itâ€™s going to hit you right then and there. Itâ€™s the best feeling in the world, Mike. It really is. Youâ€™re going to cry for two hours straight that night, I promise.</p><p>The pain in your wrist, in your legs â€”<strong> </strong>itâ€™ll all just fade away in a split second as you wheel into the corner with Hully.</p><p>Youâ€™ll skate around the ice with the Cup over your head, and itâ€™ll feel like it weighs a pound, not 35.</p><p>When you get back to the locker room, before the press and the friends and family can come in, there will be a moment.</p><p>Everyone on the team, from the coaches to the players, will have a chance to huddle in the middle of the room and tell each other what this experience â€” what this night â€”<strong> </strong>means to them. I want you to look around at all those guys and really soak it all. Remember your own journey. From the lake in Livonia, to Saskatchewan, to Minnesota and all the way to Dallas. Think about all the people who made this possible. Know each guy in that room has a story like yours.</p><p>Appreciate those guys and what youâ€™ve all just accomplished.</p><blockquote>Youâ€™re going to cry for two hours straight that night, I promise.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>When you get back home to Dallas, and you see Young Street packed with thousands and thousands of Stars fans, itâ€™s going to blow your mind. There will be hundreds at DFW to welcome you back when you land, too. Itâ€™s going to be incredible, trust me.</p><p>But what will take some time to set in is that your team changed the sport of hockey in the state of Texas â€” forever. Youâ€™ll notice in the few years after the Cup that the atmosphere at your home games is truly the best in the league. The fans will stand all game during the playoffs and every shot, hit and goal will sound like a touchdown at Cowboy Stadium. Dallas will become a hockey destination, because of what that â€™99 team did.</p><p>That to me, Mike, is legacy.</p><p>Be proud of that.</p><hr /><p>The Stanley Cup isnâ€™t everything. But I wanted you to really appreciate the journey you went on with those guys, and know that that team still matters to the people of Texas.</p><p>Thereâ€™s plenty more for you in the game after â€™99.</p><p>But, to be honest here, I donâ€™t want to spoil it all for you.</p><p>Thereâ€™s great things coming. From playing for the Wings, to retirement, to seeing your jersey go to the rafters in Prince Albert, to the Hockey Hall of Fame â€” this game will give you more than you could have imagined.Â You&#39;ll meet Allison, the love of your life. She will be your best friend and with her you&#39;ll find the most fulfilling life after hockey.Â But most importantly, youâ€™ll become a father to Kate, Jack, Reese, Luca and Quinn.Â Your family will be the greatest blessing of all. And thatâ€™ll change the way you see the world forever. I canâ€™t wait for you to experience that.</p><p>There will come a time in your life when youâ€™re not playing hockey anymore. Youâ€™ll go to events, or meet people, and somebody will introduce you as â€œMike Modano, one of the greatest American hockey players of all time.â€</p><p>I know you didnâ€™t grow up thinking about becoming that. All you wanted was to be a good teammate and win a Stanley Cup. But I hope that when that day comes, and you see the impact you had on the game, that it means something to you. Your generation of American players â€” guys like Hully, Tkachuk, Guerin, Roenick and so many others â€” helped pave the way for the game to reach another level here in the U.S. Those world-class players youâ€™ll see on TV when you get older, know that some of them look up to you guys right now.</p><p>You and your family worked hard to reach this point, know that. Youâ€™re one of the lucky ones who gets to play this game for a living.</p><p>So when you head out there for triple overtime, remember to cherish every second of it.</p><p>And make sure Hully gets the puck.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-a763f0463f44efbf6faef46ccf0d8dca.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The thing about streetball is that thereâ€™s no hiding.</p><p>I grew up in New York City, and my earliest childhood memories involve places like Dyckman court in Inwood, West 4th Street and, of course, Rucker Park.Â </p><p>When youâ€™re on those courts, thereâ€™s no faking it. You either ball or youâ€™re gonna hear about it.Â </p><p>And when I say â€œhear about it,â€ I donâ€™t mean a coach pulling you aside. I mean the announcer on the mic, the other team, everybody in the bleachers, and the people hanging out of windows â€” or 30 floors up on a roof â€” letting you <em>hear</em> about it.Â </p><p>When you have that level of pressure and the atmosphere it creates â€” thereâ€™s just nothing like it.</p><p>I grew up getting to watch some of the greatest playground legends ever, but my favorite player of all time goes by â€œDunkerâ€™s Delight.â€Â </p><p>Let me tell you about Dunkerâ€™s Delight.</p><p>It doesnâ€™t take a lot of imagination to figure out how he got his nickname. My man could throw it down from anywhere. Cradle-reverse dunk? Easy. 360 windmill? Might as well be a layup. He could fly<em>.</em>Â </p><p>He was on the Court Kingz, a streetball team that traveled around the country, kind of like the Harlem Globetrotters. He got his nickname for his dunking, of course, but what made him truly stand out was that there was so much more to his game. He could shoot from anywhere, make no-look passes, had unreal handle, and could get to the basket whenever he wanted. But make no mistake, if you thought of yourself as a rim protector, Dunkerâ€™s Delight was ready to put you on a poster.Â </p><p>There were so many young ballers who were inspired by his game, who dreamed of being able to play like him. Dreaming of one day maybe having that level of respect and legend status that he had every time he rolled up to a court.</p><p>Dunkerâ€™s Delight is my hero â€¦ and he also happens to be my dad, Obadiah Toppin.</p><p>Thatâ€™s actually how I ended up getting a nickname of my own: â€œthe Next Generation.â€Â </p><blockquote>Dunkerâ€™s Delight is my hero â€¦ and he also happens to be my dad, Obadiah Toppin.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>Thatâ€™s what they called me when my dad started letting me play in games with him when I was 12. Oh my God, you want to talk about <em>nerves</em>. I was just a scrawny kid out there, and because of my dad I was running with the most amazing players as theyâ€™re putting on a show. You know, just the other day, I was watching a YouTube highlight of me throwing him an off-the-backboard alley-oop. I still pull those videos up every now and then just to kind of take me back to those times.Â </p><p>Back then, the idea of playing in the NBA â€” or even in college â€” seemed far off. I wasnâ€™t any kind of standout. As far as I knew, those games I played with the Court Kingz might have been my basketball peak. And honestly? That would have been O.K., because sharing the court with my dad is always going to be one of the coolest things Iâ€™ve ever done. My dad didnâ€™t have to give me those experiences â€” it wasnâ€™t like there were a lot of kids running around when the Court Kingz played â€” but he did.Â </p><p>Over the years my family really struggled while my dad attempted to live out his basketball dream. I canâ€™t tell you how many times I moved growing up. Seriously, I canâ€™t even begin to count. There was nobody who believed in my dadâ€™s abilities more than I did, and seeing him struggle made me realize just what a grind it truly was to make a living playing this game.Â </p><p>We struggled a lot. We moved around to a lot of different apartments, and most of them werenâ€™t places I want to remember. Itâ€™s easy to lose focus and fall down the wrong path in that situation. And thatâ€™s why I was lucky that my dad wasnâ€™t the only hero in my family. My mom? Sheâ€™s a real legend, too. Not necessarily for her game â€” although she did coach a little bit â€” but because she was the one who gave my family stability growing up. No matter where we were, she always held us together.Â </p><p>When it came to my own basketball dreams, I knew I just needed to be good enough for someone to give me a scholarship to play basketball in order to take the financial burden off my parents.Â </p><p>But just getting to play after high school actually seemed like kind of a long shot. Usually top prospects follow a schedule where theyâ€™re basically on track for big things by the time theyâ€™re sophomores. But I was a late bloomer. Didnâ€™t dunk for the first time until the beginning of my senior year â€” and that one barely grazed the rim. (Still counts!) And by the time I finished high school, basketball still hadnâ€™t really clicked for me. I wasnâ€™t at the level I knew I had to be at to play in college. But I still believed that I could get there. Maybe not the NBA, but I could get that scholarship and maybe even play overseas, like my dad had.Â </p><p>Ultimately, I decided to go to prep school â€” to take one year to prove myself â€” and that was when my mindset changed. I began to have higher expectations and ambitions for myself, and I stopped letting other distractions get in the way. For the first time in my life, I truly focused all of my energy on my game. Just like at Dyckman or Rucker, I knew being average wasnâ€™t an option.Â </p><p>During that year, I learned a lot about myself, my game matured, and my dunks werenâ€™t just grazing over the rim anymore. Now I could do all the same dunks as my dad (and a few new ones of my own). And for the first time I started getting some recognition for more than being the son of a famous streetball player. College programs actually began to show real interest in me.Â </p><p>The opportunity to play college ball and really try to take basketball as far as I could was about more than me. I was living out this dream for my dad, too. Heâ€™d made a name for himself, and I was the next generation. That honor has never been lost on me.</p><p>I visited a few different college programs, and they all had certain things I liked. But then I went to this place Iâ€™d never been before in Ohio. It was called Dayton.Â </p><p>And I never wanted to leave.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-8c20982d49f2e58a42db349c086f46bc.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Couresy of the Toppin Family"><figcaption>Couresy of the Toppin Family</figcaption></figure><p>Itâ€™s not an exaggeration to say that I was home the moment I set foot in Dayton.</p><p>As soon as I landed at the airport, I had random people somehow recognizing who I was and telling me to come play there. And it wasnâ€™t just at the airport â€” when we walked around campus, everyone seemed to be in on it. Everyone we passed had huge smiles, and theyâ€™d be chatting up my mom about what a great school it was and how tight-knit the community was.Â </p><p>You have to understand, having moved around to so many places growing up, I wasnâ€™t accustomed to really walking around somewhere and having people say hi and ask how I was doing. And like,<em> really mean it.</em>Â </p><p>Everywhere you looked, there were flags and signs supporting the team. It was clear that basketball at Dayton was a very, very big deal.Â </p><p>Coach Grant knew that I wanted to play at the next level, and the only thing he promised me on that very first recruiting visit was that heâ€™d do everything he could to prepare me. And he also told me that if I ever was ready to make that jump, heâ€™d let me know. He didnâ€™t promise me the moon, but he also didnâ€™t tell me it would be impossible to get there. It was on me.Â </p><p>The outside world might see Dayton and think of it as just a mid-major program that makes some noise from time to time â€” but they donâ€™t really get it. Dayton is a town that <em>lives</em> basketball. Itâ€™s the thing that really brings everyone together, and only when youâ€™re part of that do you feel how important it is.Â </p><p>Everybody in Dayton loves the basketball team â€” and I just happened to play for it. It really wasnâ€™t hard to put your whole heart into the game because <em>everyone</em> <em>else</em> did, too â€” the players, the coaches and definitely the fans. That was just the culture. Not surprisingly, the more time I spent there, the more I started growing as a person and a player.Â </p><p>At the end of my second year on campus, I met with Coach Grant. Iâ€™d been named to the All-Conference team and gotten a few other awards, too. He told me that I wasnâ€™t ready for the NBA, but that I should test out the draft process to get a feel for it, and so I could get feedback from teams. Then he said something else, something that I still remember vividly, â€œAfter that, come back here, put on a show and leave a legacy.â€</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-81dcab2a24ce674396bad4a057b9e943.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Obi Toppin"><figcaption>Courtesy of Obi Toppin</figcaption></figure><p>As my fatherâ€™s son, the word <em>legacy</em> means a lot to me. I had a belief that the NBA would be there for me later, but I knew that I still had another dream to chase.Â </p><p>Everybody else in the college basketball world might have been sleeping on us, but Coach knew we were building something. It wasnâ€™t just because of me â€” we had Jalen Crutcher, and seniors like Trey Landers and Ryan Mikesell, just so many guys who could ball. We knew we had a team that could play with anybody. We just needed to prove it.Â </p><p>Our opportunity came in Maui.Â </p><p>The Maui Invitational usually attracts some of the biggest programs in college basketball. It wasnâ€™t even that we werenâ€™t the favorites there â€” we werenâ€™t even a team most people looked twice at. We were basically expected to just be a warmup for the bigger schools.</p><p>But that expectation changed pretty quickly after our first game.Â </p><p>We played Georgia, which was led by Anthony Edwards, a name familiar to anybody keeping up with the NBA draft. We went into that game with zero expectations from anybody, and we didnâ€™t just win, we dominated. Then we did the same thing to Virginia Tech, and at that point right there, we knew, <em>O.K., this is the team we are.</em></p><p>That championship game against Kansas, well â€¦ I still think about it a lot. What I never appreciated when I was watching those Maui games on ESPN growing up, is just how <em>tiny </em>the arena in Lahaina is. Youâ€™re basically in a high school gymnasium, playing these super high-stakes games. And against Kansas â€” I donâ€™t know how they got so many fans in there, but it was <em>loud</em>. I still remember Jalen trying to say something to me during the game and just seeing his mouth move but not hearing any noise come out.Â </p><p>We ultimately took them to overtime before losing. It was a great game, but we knew that if we saw them again, it was going to be different. We wouldnâ€™t drop the next one.</p><p>The season after that point, man, itâ€™s like a blur to be honest â€” just like ... too many good times.Â </p><p>Look, we won 20 games in a row heading into March. If Iâ€™m lucky Iâ€™ll get to experience a lot of great things during my basketball career. But I know for certain, that 20-game run with my best friends is something Iâ€™m always going to treasure. It was difficult to really describe what the excitement and hype around Dayton was. The town had gone through multiple tragedies leading up to the season, so for us to serve as this positive thing to be excited about â€” and all the energy the fans there gave us â€” it was amazing.Â </p><p>By the time we made it to the Atlantic 10 tournament, our ambitions were huge. We wanted to win it. We wanted a No. 1 seed. And we wanted another shot at Kansas.Â </p><p>I was really excited about the conference tournament because it was played in Brooklyn, so it felt like a kind of homecoming. Leading up to it, weâ€™d heard some rumors about games maybe being postponed because of a virus or something, but my focus was on what we had to prove there.Â </p><p>I remember the night we arrived, the plan was to watch the end of the Fordham-Duquesne game and then go to bed because we had an early workout at the Netsâ€™ facility.Â </p><p>As halftime was ending, I noticed the teams werenâ€™t coming out of their locker rooms to warm up for the second half. At first I thought, <em>Oh, thatâ€™s weird. Where are they?</em> Then it clicked in my head what was actually going on. It was at that moment that my stomach just dropped.Â </p><p>I knew it was over.Â </p><p>The season was going to get canceled.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-15137d12ca1cfabe9e9fe2f28589cd41.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Michael Hickey/Getty Images"><figcaption>Michael Hickey/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>Not long after that, Coach called us in for a meeting and made it official â€” there wouldnâ€™t be a conference tournament or an NCAA tournament. It was over.Â </p><p>And like that we were on a bus back to Dayton. The 20 wins, the No. 3 ranking, the legacy we were building â€” they were all gone.Â </p><p>There were a lot of tears on that bus ride. It just didnâ€™t feel real. Like, <em>How could this be how the story ends?</em>Â </p><p>We were hurting not just for us, but also for the community. We knew how much our team meant to it, how weâ€™d become this source of hope. Our fans deserved to enjoy watching us play, and to get their moment in the national spotlight.Â </p><p>And I just felt terrible for my teammates. Iâ€™d built up a name for myself throughout the season, but the tournament was when I knew Jalen, Trey and Ryan would get their chance to show what they could do. And on that huge stage, the world would finally see what I saw in every game and every practice â€” that we had a team good enough to beat anybody. A team that expected to beat anybody.Â </p><p>My heart still hurts over us not getting that chance to truly prove ourselves. But with time, Iâ€™ve gotten a little more perspective.Â </p><p>If youâ€™d told me three years ago â€” when I was trying to figure out some way to keep playing basketball â€” that one day Iâ€™d be on a D-I team that won 20 games in a row? I probably wouldnâ€™t have believed you. If you told me that six years ago, I <em>for sure </em>wouldnâ€™t have believed you.Â </p><p>And while I didnâ€™t get to end my career at Dayton the way I wanted to, that doesnâ€™t take away from what we did accomplish. I donâ€™t think anybody who was part of what we did will ever forget it.Â </p><p>Not long after we got back to campus, Coach Grant pulled me into his office. Weâ€™d had a lot of meetings over the years, but this one was really short. He just looked me in the eyes and said, â€œItâ€™s time to leave. Youâ€™re ready.â€Â </p><p>I didnâ€™t get to experience a lot of things that I hoped I would last year, but that one moment of validation is one that I know will always stay with me.Â </p><blockquote>My heart still hurts over us not getting that chance to truly prove ourselves.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>We all have dreams, ones maybe we just keep in the back of our minds but never really express. You work toward it and work toward it for a long time, usually never knowing if youâ€™ll ever get anywhere. Most of my life, I didnâ€™t know if Iâ€™d ever be ready for the NBA. Such a small fraction of people are. Me and my family appreciate as much as anybody how hard it is to pursue this life, the sacrifices it takes.</p><p>Being pulled aside for a â€œYouâ€™re readyâ€ from someone like Coach Grant â€” someone I just respect so much â€” and knowing he meant it, I just started crying. No, it wasnâ€™t how I thought my career at Dayton would end. I never got to cut down those nets with my teammates, or run around the court celebrating on national TV.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s easy to get swept up in the things you canâ€™t control â€” particularly in the time weâ€™re living in now. But this whole experience has taught me just how important it is to maximize what I <em>can</em> control â€” to put my focus on building up myself and my relationships so that Iâ€™m ready for whatever happens.Â </p><p>Like right now, did I expect to be thinking about the NBA draft in November? With everything done remotely? Uh, no. That wasnâ€™t how I quite dreamed it up.</p><p>But that doesnâ€™t take away from the big picture. To be on the brink of being drafted into the NBA, having the chance to represent my dad, and feel like I truly earned that name the Next Generation? Well, that means everything. Thatâ€™s what matters.</p><p>I didnâ€™t get to this moment the way I imagined, but at the same time, Iâ€™ve never really taken the traditional path to anywhere. Iâ€™ve just always been really lucky to have the right people in my life to guide me along.</p><p>I still get asked all the time: <em>How do you think you guys would have done in the NCAA tournament?Â </em></p><p>And speaking as a soon-to-be-professional who handles things very professionally, I donâ€™t like dwelling on the past and talking in hypotheticals.Â </p><p>O.K., thatâ€™s out of the way.</p><p>Now, in my heart, as a Flyer, do I truly believe we would have been the last team standing at the end of March Madness?</p><p><em>Hell </em>yeah<em>.Â </em></p><p>No doubt.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA10AAAHk-62982735982c2c14408cd1199b4573d8.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The first martial arts movie I ever watched was this old Chinese film calledÂ <em>Five Deadly Venoms.Â </em>I was seven years old. My dad and I were sitting in front of the TV on the floor in our living room.</p><p>It starts out with this old kung fu master and his student. Theyâ€™re in a temple or a cave somewhere in China and thereâ€™s smoke rising from a fire. The student is heating water for the masterâ€™s bath. The master is old and dying. He has one last wish. He instructs his student to go on a mission to defeat the masterâ€™s five former pupils, who have turned evil. Each of the bad guys has a unique fighting style named for an animal: the Centipede, the Lizard, the Scorpion, the Snake, and the Toad. To take down each one, the master explains, the student will have to learn all five styles.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRlxXAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-dafe62c46710c7420ad99087920acc5a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>As a kid, a lot of these movies went over my head. I couldnâ€™t really follow the dialogue all the time. But that didnâ€™t matter. I just loved them. Even the fact that they were dubbed was cool to me. I wanted to know more about this foreign world, where guys knew how to run up the sides of walls and break down wooden doors with their foreheads. Iâ€™d never seen anything like it. They just had so much â€¦ control.</p><p>I grew up in a kung fu house. It wasnâ€™t until I got older that I discovered that most families didnâ€™t talk about the Shaolin Temple or Jackie Chan at the dinner table.</p><p>The best part of watching kung fu movies with my dad was the conversations they sparked. We never watched them just for fun.</p><p>â€œDo you see how good his balance is?â€ My dad would always zero in on really specific stuff like that. Everything had a potential lesson.</p><p>I liked the fighting scenes the best. We would talk about Bruce Lee a lot. I would ask my dad to rewind a Bruce Lee scene so we could watch it again in slo-mo. Bruce would twirl two nunchakus like they were literally an extension of his body.</p><p>My dad encouraged me to notice more than just the fighting.</p><p>â€œLook at his footwork,â€ he would say. â€œLook at his patience.â€</p><p>He would get up really close to the TV, pointing at Bruce Lee on the screen.</p><p>â€œWatch how he uses his mind to defeat his enemy.â€</p><p>My dad liked to point out that Bruce Lee was small. He was strong, for sure, but he didnâ€™t overpower people with muscle. The mental side of martial arts is what got my dad fired up.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRgrNAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-909c88c7805750910ab010e618d480d5.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Learning to meditate is one of my earliest memories. I started when I was maybe three or four. I mean, I didnâ€™tÂ <em>know</em>Â I was meditating. I just thought it was a weird game my dad had invented. I would sit on the couch and try to remain as still as possible. That wasnâ€™t too hard. Then my dad would try to make me laugh. Heâ€™d make funny faces and think of all kinds of ways to distract me. I was supposed to stay in control and not react â€” to pretend he wasnâ€™t there. But the goal wasnâ€™t to pretend heÂ <em>wasnâ€™t</em>Â there. It was to clear my mind and notice everything that was going on around me.</p><p>As I got older, I got better at it. We would increase the difficulty by meditating in public, on a park bench or in a busy restaurant. Even if I was just quieting my mind for two minutes, I felt like I was building a special muscle that no one could see. Without really knowing it, I was training.</p><p>Basketball is my first love. I grew up in Kitchener, Ont., a small town about an hourâ€™s drive from Toronto. Some people know Kitchener as the home of former heavyweight champ Lennox Lewis. And of course, hockey is big there. Itâ€™s Canada. I could never really skate, but I used to offer to play goalie when we played hockey in school. (I was pretty good.) But for me, it was always basketball that called my name. I became known for being the kid who always had a ball in his hands. In grade school I used to take a ball with me to the school and bounce it between my legs the whole way. Then Iâ€™d do it all the way home. I even slept with a ball at times. I remember when I learned to spin a ball on my finger â€” my mom loves this story â€” because I broke several glasses in our kitchen in the process.</p><p>My dad would always put a little kung fu into our basketball workouts. â€œPut on this blindfold,â€ my dad would say. Weâ€™d be out on the outdoor court in our backyard.</p><p>The court was really just a patch of grass with a hoop. I played out there so much that it became hard dirt. I even made my own three-point line, measuring it out and marking it with sticks. I loved that court.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRqK9AABXRUJQVlA4IJa9AABwrAO-b652e2a4cbd0a2d047fac8b045d5d966.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>At first, I really didnâ€™t like the blindfold drill.</p><p>â€œWhy are we doing this, Dad?â€ Iâ€™d complain. No one else had to do these drills with their dad, I would tell him.</p><p>â€œThis is what it feels like when you arenâ€™t in control,â€ he would respond. â€œYouâ€™re playing blind.â€ It sounded like a kung fu movie. I couldnâ€™t see how this drill was better than just taking a lot of shots.</p><p>So Iâ€™d shoot these blind free throws while my dad rebounded. One after another. My dad would get right in my ear, doing his best to get in my head.</p><p>â€œMaybe youâ€™re not ready!â€</p><p>â€œTime to quit!â€</p><p>â€œYouâ€™ve gone fishinâ€™. Youâ€™re done.â€</p><p>Sometimes Iâ€™d airball it, but most of the time Iâ€™d hit rim. Not very many went in.</p><p><em>Clank. Clank. Clank.</em></p><p>Sometimes my dad would hold the ball for a minute at a time, making me wait.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRjYlAQBXRUJQVlA4IColAQBQugS-fe4f03ae078041f9053b4bf7e809a476.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Heâ€™d tell me to take off the blindfold and shoot a few with my eyes open. Then heâ€™d have me put the blindfold back on, and again it would feel weird. I tried to feel all the muscles that went into the mechanics of my shot. The more we did it, the more comfortable it was to not have to rely on my eyes. By high school, we had done the blindfold drill hundreds of times. By that time, when my dad tried to distract me, he was just wasting his time. I could see the hoop in my head.</p><p><em>Swish.</em>Â <em>Swish. Swish.</em></p><p>As I got older, my dadâ€™s ideas about mental discipline seemed less and less weird. I remember driving to my city semifinal game in Grade 10. My dad was driving a sprinter van full of my teammates, and I was in the backseat. Music was blasting and guys were fooling around, making jokes and all of that. Our nerves were bouncing off the walls inside that van.</p><p>About halfway there, my dad turned around and gave me a stare.</p><p>â€œSettle down and focus.â€</p><p>He said it loud enough so only I heard him.</p><p>I closed my eyes. The van was bumping along the road. My teammates were still singing, yelling, doing their thing. I tried my best to concentrate. I thought about lacing my shoes, putting on my uniform, listening to my coachâ€™s pregame speech. I imagined walking out onto the court and how bright the lights would be. I imagined someone yelling at me from the crowd. I tried to envision how the ball would feel on my first jump shot. I could see their best player, a guy we had scouted, and I went over his go-to moves in my head.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRqTjAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-ac6372108c49e3dcdc6e10b4bbbc275d.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When the van jolted to a stop, I realized we were at the arena. I was ready to go.</p><p>It was a close game all the way. With about 40 seconds left, I tied it with a three. The other team came down and missed two free throws. But on our next trip down, we missed and they got the ball back. They called a timeout with five seconds left. Tie game.</p><p>Looking back, I think about how calm I was. My mind wasnâ€™t racing. I felt focused. When they took the ball out, I got a jump on the passing lane and stole the ball. With just a few seconds left, I had to pull up from half court. Somehow, some way, the ball went in at the buzzer. We went on to the city finals.</p><p>The reason I think of that game isnâ€™t really because of my game-winning shot. Making the shot was nice, but I was more proud of the steal. I was locked in at just the right time.</p><p>I used to quiet my mind before games at Rupp Arena. I wanted to savor everything: The crazy student section, the alumni, the season ticket holders, blue and white everywhere. Kentucky fans are next level. Basketball is getting popular in Canada, but thereâ€™s a special type of Wildcat blue running through the veins of Kentucky fans. Itâ€™s not always easy quieting your mind with all that going on.</p><p>Coach Cal and Coach Payne are big reasons why I came to Kentucky. Their openness made it really easy to communicate with the coaching staff. A lot of people only know the guys they see on TV. As coaches, they can be fun and serious at the same time. Theyâ€™reÂ upbeat and animated, but also all business when they need to be. Above everything else, they treated us as family.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRsCyAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-631fe25b909801995145f5335c531594.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Lexington became my second home this year. The program is great about making us all feel part of the same family. To all the Kentucky fans that supported me, I loved playing in front of you. I fed off of your energy. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p><p>Iâ€™m really going to miss my teammates and our traditions. During the Ohio State game this year, I hit a three and I was running back on D. I looked over at the bench and my teammate EJ was pretending to shoot a bow and arrow. The next time I hit a three, I copied what he did. You wind your right arm back like youâ€™re pulling back an arrow, then you let it go. Our whole bench started to do it whenever we hit a three. A tradition, and a new nickname, had been born.</p><p>Next year Iâ€™ll definitely be watching the team and following their success. I know theyâ€™ll do big things and create new traditions of their own.</p><p>As I move on to the NBA draft, itâ€™s a big unknown out there. I know I canâ€™t control everything, but I will remain just as focused on my mental game as on my physical game. In crunch time, I want to guard the other teamâ€™s best player. I want the ball for the last shot.</p><p>Iâ€™m looking forward to seeing what bullseye I can hit next, blindfolded or not.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>The first time I played football, I pretty much hated it.</p><p>I was nine years old and my best friend, Sebastian Moore, and I joined the Mighty Men, the local youth team that practiced at Dunbar High School on the corner of 29th and King on the South Side of Chicago. Sebastianâ€™s momÂ told us that going out for football would be a good way to keep busy and stay out of trouble. And so there we were on the first day of practice, standing in lines as we waited to perform mundane drills in the hot sun.</p><p>And these lines wereÂ <em>long</em>. There must have been 50 kids out there. We were standing around for what seemed like forever, then we would only get to carry the ball once or twice. It was boring. It was hot. And the coaches kept yelling at us. I wanted to quit.</p><p>When I got home, I told my mother I was done. Even though going out for football wasnâ€™t even her idea, she wasnâ€™t going to let me give up after just one practice. My mother is one of the toughest people I know â€” and Iâ€™ve come across a lot of actual drill sergeants. I donâ€™t think sheâ€™s ever quit anything halfway through in her life. So she just gave me this look like,Â <em>No, child</em>. And then she said, â€œYouâ€™re going to practice tomorrow.â€</p><p>So I went every day for the rest of the summer. And man, I was miserable.</p><p>But I stuck with it, and three years later, when I was in the seventh grade, I realized that I actually kind of liked football. Now that didnâ€™t mean I was great at it. In fact, I was a pretty selfish player, only concerned about my own performance. I couldnâ€™t stand it when my teammates would fumble the ball. One day at practice I decided Iâ€™d had enough. I got up in their faces and yelled, â€œHow do you fumble the ball? All you gotta do is hold it! Stop letting people take it from you!â€</p><p>And then on the next play â€¦ I fumbled. I was so mad at myself that I punched the ground, which was hard packed dirt. It hurt a little bit, but I didnâ€™t think much of it. Luckily, my team recovered the ball. I was still fuming. But when we broke the huddle before our next play, I went to clap and a pain shot through my right hand. I took a handoff and couldnâ€™t hold on to the ball. When I went to show my coach my hand after the play, the knuckle on my little finger was floating by my wrist. It was a boxerâ€™s fracture.</p><p>Coach called my mom and she came to pick me up. She had been at the grocery store, and instead of taking me straight to the hospital, she went back to the store so she could finish shopping. She had me carrying water cases around behind the cart â€” she didnâ€™t have much sympathy for my broken knuckle, especially after she found out how it had happened.</p><p>At the hospital the doctor made me look away while he pulled my finger out and popped it back into place â€” but I was still peeking. That really left an impression on me. Iâ€™m generally pretty calm, but as I watched my hand contort, I realized there werenâ€™t many other things in life where making a mistake made me mad enough to punch the ground. It showed me just how much I cared â€” I was almost surprised by how much the game meant to me. That was the moment when I knew I would be a football player.</p><p>As I write this now, Iâ€™m so grateful that my mother made me stick with football. I never asked her why she didnâ€™t just take me straight to the hospital after I broke my knuckle, but Iâ€™m pretty sure she was trying to teach me her kind of lesson: In order to be great at football, or anything else, you have to be able to persevere when the going gets tough.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRhhMAgBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-e84d2e4a50fc8d57befd600707ed3f1e.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><hr /><p>If you want to understand me you have to start with my mother. Her name is Kizzy Collins. Sheâ€™s one of the toughest people Iâ€™ve ever met.</p><p>She raised me as a single mom in Chicagoâ€™s Bronzeville neighborhood. It was rough. When I was a senior in high school, a friend of mine was shot and killed on his birthday. Too many kids that age from my neighborhood met the same fate. I could have easily gone down the wrong path, but there was no way my mom would let that happen.</p><p>She worked in the marketing department of theÂ <em>Chicago Tribune</em>Â from eight to five every day. Then she would go to school to study marketing in the evenings and not come home until 10. We had a pitbull, Mecca, and it actually didnâ€™t know her because she was never home. He barked at her one day because he didnâ€™t recognize her, and she gave him away. Just like that. He was a nice dog, but like I said: My mom is a tough lady.</p><p>She came to all of my games on the weekends when I was in middle school and high school. And if I had a game on Saturday sheâ€™d cook food beforehand for the kids to eat after they were done playing â€” just like all the other parents. I never thought about it when I was little, but now I appreciate what it took for her to do that after having worked so hard all week. Did she ever sleep?</p><p>Growing up, I lived in a two-bedroom apartment with my mother, my grandmother, Mona Collins, and my aunt, Nina Collins. My other aunt, Deneen Collins, and my two cousins lived in the apartment upstairs. Since my mom was at work all the time I spent a lot of my free time with them. My grandmother is the one who taught me how to play pretty much every sport â€” football, baseball, basketball and volleyball. She didnâ€™t really know the rules of football, but she would toss the ball around with me in the yard and let me run circles around her.</p><p>The four women who raised me are the reason I came to West Point (Kizzy Collins, Mona Collins, Nina Collins and Deneen Collins). For a long time I thought I would go to Wisconsin and play football, but I wanted to go to a school where I had a clear picture of what Iâ€™d be doing after graduation. I wanted to be able to take care of my family and help others. My mom helped me so much by working hard every day. Now itâ€™s my turn to do the same for her. Thatâ€™s my main goal in life.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRvC5AABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-3467f5a8dac709f4ee289881d59fbfb5.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Guillermo Hernandez Martinez/The Players"><figcaption>Guillermo Hernandez Martinez/The Players</figcaption></figure><p>I went to the U.S. Military Academy Prep School before I got to West Point. I was 18 years old, and my goal was to play football for Army. I knew it would be a challenge â€” that it would test me in ways Iâ€™d never been tested before â€” but I still wasnâ€™t fully prepared for what I experienced early on. I think thatâ€™s true of just about everyone who enrolls here, and it starts on Day One.</p><p>New cadets go to Cadet Basic Training at West Point in the summer before their freshman year. The first day is called R-Day, and itâ€™sÂ <em>intense</em>. One minute youâ€™re hugging your mom goodbye, and the next youâ€™re getting yelled at by upperclassmen. They tell you youâ€™re moving too slow, but then they yell at you if you start running, so you have to walk everywhere really fast. By the end of the day your head is bald, your face is shaved and youâ€™re marching in a parade in your dress uniform in front of your parents. Youâ€™re a completely different person. R-Day didnâ€™t really freak me out â€” Iâ€™d been getting screamed at by football coaches since the fourth grade â€” but there were some kids who were so scared that they started crying and got right back in the car with their parents and went home.</p><p>The moment where I wanted to quit didnâ€™t come until the next morning. At about 4:30, this group of cadets came running into our barracks yelling, â€œYouâ€™ve got two minutes to get on the wall!â€ I was so shaken. We were supposed to make our beds, get dressed and get on the wall inÂ <em>two minutes.</em>Â We were all outside in T-shirts and shorts. I thought that would be O.K. because it was summertime. But at 4:30 in the morning it was freezing. We stood there for 15 minutes in formation, just shivering. There was still dew on the grass when we started doing push-ups and sit-ups for our morning physical training, so now we were not only freezing, but also wet. It was so uncomfortable.</p><p>Playing Division I football is incredibly tough, but nothing compares to the challenge of making it as a cadet at West Point. Whenever I find myself struggling, I try to compare what Iâ€™m experiencing to a harder time that somebody I know has gone through. I have thought a lot lately about a family member of mine in Chicago. He was homeless and has since passed away. He stayed with us at our house for a while when I was a kid, but his pride was so big that he wouldnâ€™t stay for long â€” even though he didnâ€™t know where he was going to sleep the next night or when his next meal would be. I think of my friends from the South Side who lost their lives to gun violence. An early morning drill isnâ€™t much compared to those kinds of things.</p><p>During my time at the academy, the way I analyze situations has changed. Iâ€™ve learned to speak up when I see something wrong, no matter how big or small. I see it as my professional responsibility to fix issues. As a team captain, a lot of my teammates come to me for advice, and I owe it to them to be honest. I value these relationships and feel that I am in a better position to help them based on my development at the academy. I think speaking up and giving honest feedback are the keys to growth. West Point created an environment where I could develop into the sort of leader that the Army expects and deserves.</p><p>When I was just a kid on the South Side I knew I wanted to surround myself with friends, mentors and peers that have good character and high expectations for me. I found that at the academy and for that I am so thankful.</p><p>Iâ€™m so lucky to be here. To be at this school, to be on this team, to be coached by someone as smart and talented as Coach Monken. He is the main reason Army went from winning two games in 2015 to going undefeated at home this year and being in a position to win the Commander-in-Chiefâ€™s Trophy for the first time in 21 years. All weâ€™ve got left to do is beat Navy on Saturday â€” something weâ€™ve only done once in the last 15 years.</p><p>But beating them twice is another one of my goals.</p><hr /><p>We almost lost to the Midshipmen last year. They had scored early in the fourth quarter to go up 17â€“14. We got the ball with about 13 minutes to go. What I remember most is our determination. In past years, our team might have gotten down and concluded it just wasnâ€™t our year. But this was different. We looked at each other in the huddle and all the guys on the offensive line started grabbing each other and saying, â€œAll right, letâ€™s tighten up! We got this!â€</p><p>When our offense is working, itâ€™s because every single person on the field is doing their specific job well. Itâ€™s kind of beautiful when everything comes together and pretty much impossible to stop. When we walk up to the line of scrimmage, we know weâ€™re gonna run the ball, and the other team knows weâ€™re gonna run the ball, but we do it anyway. Our receivers are some of the most selfless teammates Iâ€™ve ever had. They know weâ€™re not going to throw the ball 15 to 30 times a game. But theyâ€™re still out there making blocks and playing just as hard as anybody else, with or without the ball.</p><p>On that drive against Navy, we held the ball for almost seven minutes. On second-and-eight from Navyâ€™s 12-yard line, I kept the ball and was running around the right edge, behind Andy Davidson, who was my lead blocker. I saw tackle Brett Toth seal the edge and in a split second I made a decision: I wasnâ€™t just gonna go for the first down, I was going all the way. Right before I got to the goal line I saw this guy from Navy waiting for me. I ran full speed and lowered my shoulder. I could feel guys kind of pushing me from the back to get those last few inches. I couldnâ€™t tell if I had made it into the end zone, but then I saw the referee signal a touchdown. Thatâ€™s when everything erupted. I couldnâ€™t even see faces. Just pure noise and excitement. We won 21â€“17.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRowKAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-bc0fed0eb71864a79e32230e380fc9f3.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Rob Carr/Getty Images"><figcaption>Rob Carr/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>That play was the play that broke Armyâ€™s 14-year losing streak against Navy. That was also the play that started a movement for Army football. It was a breakthrough. Ever since our team has had a different mind-set. Weâ€™re more confident, we know who we are, and we know what we need to do to win.</p><p>A big part of that, like I said, comes from Coach Monken. Heâ€™s gotten everybody to work together in a way only cadets could understand.Â Itâ€™s easy to be an individual in football. Like if I was a receiver and I just ran my routes and didnâ€™t worry about what the other receiver was doing on the other side of the field. But in the military, if I donâ€™t get a certain part of my mission done, it can have serious consequences. Everybody has to do their job, but everybody also has to be molded together.</p><p>This Saturday, Iâ€™m going to be playing in my final Army-Navy game. Itâ€™s the biggest game of my life and I know how big the stakes are. Honestly, thatâ€™s the coolest part about it. Everybody from Navy is watching, everybody from Army is watching, and soldiers all over the world are watching, too. Army-Navy is so much bigger than just two teams on a field.</p><p>One win isnâ€™t a streak, but itâ€™s a start. The mission is clear, and the objective is in our sights:</p><p>Beat Navy.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Donâ€™t believe everything you hear. Thatâ€™s my advice to the NBA Draft Class of 2015. In this day and age, thereâ€™s a lot of chatter about guys being â€œlocksâ€ for certain teams. A lot of that stuff isnâ€™t just coming out of thin air. Teams will literally tell you to your face in the days before the Draft, â€œIf youâ€™re there, weâ€™re taking you.â€ But the reality is that crazy things can happen when the dominos start falling on Thursday night.</p><p>I was sitting in the green room during the 2013 Draft, and I was pretty much chillinâ€™ because I had a couple teams in the Top 10 who said they would take me. But at the same time, itâ€™s kind of a weird situation because you have your entire life packed up in a few suitcases back at the hotel room, and depending on what happens over the course of a few hours, you could be taking those bags on a flight anywhere. Your whole life is genuinely hanging in the balance. So itâ€™s super exciting, but also surreal.</p><p>When the Draft started and David Stern walked up to podium, I thought for sure I was going to Sacramento. They had the No. 7 pick, and asked me to fly back to Sac for a second workout to take a closer look. But then when I saw Nerlens Noel slide to Philadelphia, I immediately started seeing the puzzle pieces shift in my head. Sure enough, Sacramento took Ben McLemore at 7. Apparently, he was No. 1 on their Draft board, but they didnâ€™t think he was going to be there. So itâ€™s a good thing I didnâ€™t show up to the draft in a purple suit. Detroit and Minnesota were up next, and my name wasnâ€™t called. Over the course of 15 minutes, youâ€™re envisioning yourself in all these different jerseys and all these different cities.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRqZHAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-81934a50738f5021cc0b9378f5a4c054.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>My phone was blowing up with all kinds of texts but there was only one that I knew was for real â€” it was from Damian Lillard. It just said, â€œUh oh.â€</p><p>Dame and I had been Internet Friends through Twitter for, like, two years. We were both scorers from small schools, and Dame was leading the country in scoring at Weber State for most of the 2011-2012 season. I was third or fourth. So somehow we connected through a mutual friend. Then, when he got picked by Portland that year, it was really encouraging to me. Thatâ€™s when I knew I could be a lottery pick coming out of Lehigh. So we would text one another about basketball stuff all throughout my senior year, but we had never met in person up until the NBA Draft Lottery event in New York City. I saw him standing there, and it was super funny because it felt like some online dating thing where you finally meet the person for real. Itâ€™s like, â€œHey, bro, weâ€™ve been talking forÂ <em>years</em>. Nice to meet you.â€</p><p>So when he texted me â€œUh oh,â€ I got excited because I knew exactly what he meant. We had been talking about how cool it would be to play together for months. When I was taking my meetings with teams around the country, I posted three cities on my Instagram that I really liked. I didnâ€™t tell anybody what it meant â€” it was just kind of an inside thing. Portland was one of those cities. Actually, I remember getting to Portland, and being introduced to all kinds of organic food and shopping at New Seasons Market. I was a No. 2 guy at Lehigh. Get home from practice and hit the No. 2 meal at McDonaldâ€™s with no pickle. Now, Iâ€™m out here eating meals I struggle to pronounce.</p><p>The next couple minutes were a blur. David Stern walked up to the podium and announced my name, and I mean,Â <em>damn</em>. To be able to hug my mom, dad, my brother, GMA, and walk up on that stage and put on the hat, it was really a dream come true.</p><p>Now, you have to remember, Iâ€™m coming from Lehigh, so I didnâ€™t have some crazy advance. Iâ€™m still broke, for real. So that night I just remember enjoying as many free drinks (non-alcoholic, of course) as I possibly could. Thatâ€™s the crazy thing about the NBA Draft parties â€” everything is comped! Thatâ€™s a real savior for the mid-major guys who have all their boys coming to celebrate with them. So I actually have two pieces of advice for NBA Draftees: Donâ€™t believe everything you hear, and be sure to take advantage of the free drinks. New York is expensive.</p><p>After that night, everything moves really fast, depending on whether or not your team wants you in town the following day for a press conference. You grab your bags and youâ€™re on a plane to your team. When I got to Portland, and they gave me my jersey and my first pair of real NBA socks with the Jerry West logo, that was crazy. I donâ€™t know why but Iâ€™ve been thinking about getting those thick-ass NBA socks since I was a little kid. Theyâ€™re like walking on clouds.</p><p>                                                                                                   *</p><p>I didnâ€™t have too much time to watch NCAA ball this season but Iâ€™ve hit YouTube pretty hard over the last few days to research some of these rookies, and here are a few under-the-radar and or small school guys that I like. (Yes, Iâ€™m biased towards guards.)</p><p><strong>Cameron Payne</strong><br/><strong>School:Â </strong>Murray State<br/><strong>Reminds me of:Â </strong>Damon Stoudamire</p><p>One of the knocks on Payne is quality of competition. All I can say to that is, look at who just won the NBA MVP. Steph Curry went to Davidson. One of the advantages of going to a small school is that youâ€™re expected to be the man. They have to give you the ball, and thereâ€™s more room for error in a situation where you can play your way through mistakes (and no matter how good you are, this is a valuable coping skill at the NBA level). Payne was the guy circled on the scouting report every single night. When youâ€™re coming from a mid-major program, a lot of teams donâ€™t want to schedule you for out-of-conference games if you have an NBA caliber player on your roster, because they essentially have to pay your school for the opportunity to come in and whoop their ass.</p><p>I started following Payne after I heard about this smooth lefty who had led Murray State to 25 wins in a row. Yes, he can shoot. But what I like about him is that heâ€™s got a good hesitation move, nice change of speed and a floater, which I think is going to be key for him at 6â€™2â€ in the NBA. If Iâ€™m Payne, Iâ€™m watching a lot of film on Mike Conley, another lefty. Conley can finish with both hands and he has theÂ <a href="http://www.grizzlybearblues.com/features/2015/1/15/7541653/mike-conley-floater-shot-analysis-ambidextrous" target="_blank">best righty floater</a>Â Iâ€™ve ever seen for a left-handed guy.</p><p>Everything in the NBA is sped up. Lanes close much faster than college. So itâ€™s about having a very balanced skill set as a guard, and Payne has that package of shooting, passing and slashing. Heâ€™s also 180, so heâ€™s going to need to put on some pounds, but the facilities and weight rooms in the NBA are going to be so far beyond what he had at Murray State, so I wouldnâ€™t worry about it. You can transform your body pretty quickly with 24/7 nutrition and trainers.</p><p>I also like Payne because he wasnâ€™t even ranked by any scouting services in high school. I remember my junior year, before I was getting any hype, I used to tell scouts that I was being recruited by random mid-majors. â€œOh yeah, Iâ€™m talking to uh â€¦ Youngstown State.â€ I figured they would never actually call and check. And even if they did, the Youngstown State coach might be afraid to get beat to the punch and be like, â€œHmm â€¦ whoâ€™s this McCollum kid? I better check him out.â€</p><p>You gotta hustle.</p><p><strong>R.J. Hunter</strong><br/><strong>School:</strong>Â Georgia State<br/><strong>Reminds me of:Â </strong>Rip Hamilton</p><p>Similar to Payne, heâ€™s a lean guy from a small school who can really ball. With Hunter, what I notice is his ability to pull up and hit big-time shots from anywhere on the floor. With what he did to Baylor in the NCAA Tournament, heâ€™s proven that he has the clutch gene. Some of the threes he hit were very, very deep, and off the dribble.</p><p>You look at the team who just won the NBA title and you see a bunch of guys who have a very quick release who can shoot from anywhere. The NBA is evolving into a league where you have to be able to get up-and-down, shoot threes and play multiple positions. This is the kind of guy that players want on their team. Â Hunter is only a 6â€™5â€ two-guard, but he has almost a 6â€™10â€ wingspan. Quick release + long wingspan = a guy who can contribute right away.</p><p>Shooting is the one thing that always translates seamlessly to the NBA level, but I will say that R.J. is going to find that itâ€™s a lot harder to shoot from deep when youâ€™re tired. In college, the line is so close that you can kind of half-heartedly shoot the ball off-balance and fading away. To shoot an NBA three, because the arc of your shot has to be a little higher, you have to be squared up and get your legs into it more, which can be tough in the fourth quarter.</p><p>With R.J., itâ€™s not just that he can shoot, he canÂ <em>move,Â </em>which is why I see some Rip Hamilton in him. He can curl into the lane and finish with the floater, which is essential for an undersized guard. At 180 or 190, youâ€™re not going to be able to get to the hoop and dunk in the NBA. Itâ€™s just impossible to take that beating night in, night out. Bigs hate the floater because they canâ€™t contest it â€” itâ€™s too quick and itâ€™s all about touch. R.J. should watch how Steph Curry has implemented an overhand and underhand floater into his repertoire. I donâ€™t care how many pounds he puts on, R.J. is going to need to pull that out of the bag of tricks when he sees Dwight Howard in the lane.</p><p><strong>Anthony Brown</strong><br/><strong>School:Â </strong>Stanford<br/><strong>Reminds me of:</strong>Â DeMarre Carroll</p><p>I got some inside info here because I worked out with him last year when I was in L.A. (we use the same trainer, AJ Diggs). Heâ€™s a 6â€™7â€ small forward with a great wingspan who might be one of the best shooters in the draft (44% from three in his last two seasons). Heâ€™s also a senior who went to Stanford, so you know youâ€™re going to get a smart, mature guy in your locker room right away.</p><p>Heâ€™s a classic three-and-D player. Right now it looks like heâ€™ll be a fringe first rounder, but with the new deal coming in â€™16, itâ€™s almost sometimes better to go second round than late first. Second rounders get fewer guaranteed years, which means you can hit the market faster. Of course, we can project all we want, but you never know whatâ€™s gonna happen in the NBA with some of these guys. A lot of times, whether a player fits with a team is as big a factor in determining their fate at their skill level. If Brown finds the right spot, I think heâ€™ll stick around in this league a long time. When you have an almost seven-foot wingspan and can guard multiple positions, youâ€™re going to get minutes. The long wingspan combined with good lateral quickness will allow him to sag off screens and still be able to contest shots. (Fighting over screens in the NBA is tough. Remind me to tell you all my horror stories about guarding Lou Williams some day.)</p><p>I like his game and his attitude, and I can see him becoming a big X-factor for a winning team on both ends of the floor â€” similar to DeMarre Carroll in Atlanta. Thatâ€™s whatâ€™s always so interesting about the NBA Draft â€” all the hype is about the franchise guys at the top, but I can just see Brown going to the Warriors at 30 and everyone kind of ignoring it. But then, in three years, heâ€™ll be making a huge difference guarding a superstar and hitting big spot-up threes in the Finals.</p><p>                                                                                                  *</p><p>Letâ€™s do a few more quick ones. I havenâ€™t seen as much of these guys.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRthkAQBXRUJQVlA4IMxkAQDwTga-65daf52d4fa9230f767f1113ae39b9cc.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Tyler Harvey</strong><br/><strong>School:Â </strong>Eastern Washington<br/><strong>Reminds me of:</strong>Â Gary Neal</p><p>Tyler led the country in scoring last season, which is always worth a look. Recent NBA players that led the NCAA in scoring include Doug McDermott, Reggie Williams and Steph Curry. One of the things about Harvey that impressed me is that he had a true shooting percentage of over 60 percent, so heâ€™s efficient. He also shot over 40 percent from three. He just has a great scoring sense and can get up shots in a hurry, and catch fire just as quickly. At 6â€™4â€, 180 lbs., I think itâ€™s going to be interesting to see how his game translates to the NBA, but I like what he did in college. Heâ€™s definitely someone to keep an eye on during the summer league. His ability to score is something that could translate.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRvLjAQBXRUJQVlA4IObjAQBQpAm-9e6142ac30e76e3c5cd8d99c554ee2c6.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Olivier Hanlan</strong><br/><strong>School:Â </strong>Boston College<br/><strong>Reminds me of:Â </strong>Marcus Thornton</p><p>Like Tyler, Olivier is a guy who specializes in scoring and could be some instant offense in the NBA. He went to Boston College for three years, and showed improvement every season. He also averaged 19.5 points against tough competition in the ACC. The best way to describe his style of play is smooth. He looks natural out there. He did well at the combine with his ability to create in the pick and rolls, and for that reason as much as anything else I think heâ€™ll stick on someoneâ€™s roster.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRrqPAQBXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAgAAA-6efd481d92aa49ac164883769de7d17a.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Richaun Holmes</strong><br/><strong>School:</strong>Â Bowling Green<br/><strong>Reminds me of:Â </strong>Too early to say at this point</p><p>Iâ€™m throwing this in here as my super sleeper. I saw Richaun work out for the Blazers last week, and came away impressed. Heâ€™s a late-blooming, athletic power forward. He started out at a community college when he was a freshman but showed noticeable improvement every year at Bowling Green, and was named the defensive player of the year in the MAC this past season. He had a pretty good PER too.</p><p>The thing that will have teams intrigued is his great footwork and timing. He can contest shots very well, but what also caught my eye was his ability to knock down shots. He shot over 40 percent from three last season, but heâ€™s 6â€™10â€ so he didnâ€™t take a lot of threes because they needed him in the paint. Heâ€™s very skilled, a little raw, but heâ€™s an NBA-level athlete. I think heâ€™s a sleeper guy who can surprise some people.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABDgAAAJg-ed0dec260235b3497185aaf4111c88d3.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>Para ler em PortuguÃªs, </em><a href="richarlison-soccer-everton-brazil-portuguese" target="_blank"><em><strong>clique aqui.</strong></em></a></p><p>I want to tell you a fishing story.Â </p><p>When I was 17 years old and living in Brazil, I went to visit my dad for the weekend with my two brothers and my cousins. My dad, AntÃ´nio, was not having an easy time. He had been separated from my mum, Vera Lucia, for 10 years, and was living on a farm on his own. Worse, he was suffering from depression.Â </p><p>I was very attached to him, in part because he had always believed in my dream to become a footballer. He would go anywhere to watch me play. Of course I wanted to be a pro.Â </p><p>Yet the only thing I had achieved was a long list of rejections.Â </p><p>In fact I was running out of time to get my big break. I was training with the youth team of AmÃ©rica-MG, one of the biggest clubs in the state of Minas Gerais. Even though I was already old by youth academy standards, I was still trying to get a contract.</p><p>So I knew this was my last chance.Â </p><p>Anyway, on this particular weekend the team had been given some time off, and since I was living with my mum, it was only natural to spend some time with Dad. While we were at his place, my brothers and cousins and I grabbed our fishing rods and headed out to these three ponds near the house. They must have been on the same piece of land, because the landlord had said that we were only allowed to fish in two of them. The third pond was forbidden.Â </p><p>So we spent the entire day fishing in the two ponds. And we got nothing.Â </p><p>To be honest, we didnâ€™t really care. We were only there to have fun. But on the way back to the house, we walked past the Forbidden Pond. We looked at each other. We looked at the pond. Nobody else seemed to be watching. We still had some bait leftâ€¦.Â </p><p>And so I hooked on a piece and tossed it into the water.Â </p><p>Two seconds laterâ€¦.Â </p><p>SNAP!</p><p>Fish on.Â </p><p>Iâ€™m still not sure why I did it. Anyway, it was stupid, because the landlord eventually found out about it. He went to my dad and shouted at him in front of a group of people, saying he could kick him out of his house any time he wanted.Â </p><p>It was the last thing my dad needed. He was humiliated.</p><p>And in that moment, something clicked inside my head. I remember telling my Uncle Elton, â€œI will do <em>anything </em>to get a contract at AmÃ©rica. Iâ€™m gonna get my dad out of there.â€Â </p><p>Before that, helping my family through football had been just an <em>idea</em>.Â </p><p>Suddenly it was an obsession.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-e80468b5e62dfd804a936d08a705f8d5.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Richarlison"><figcaption>Courtesy of Richarlison</figcaption></figure><p>Looking back, I guess I was bound to grow attached to my dad the moment he gave me a bunch of footballs for my birthday. There is no better way to win the loyalty of a Brazilian kid. At the time, my family was living together in a wooden house in Todos os Santos, a little village in the state of EspÃ­rito Santo, near the Brazilian coast. There was a football pitch close to our home where I used to play with my friends. When I was not there, Iâ€™d be out watching my dad play for his local team. Wherever my dad went â€” whether he was playing cards or seeing his friends in the town square â€” he would take me with him.Â </p><p>When I was seven, my parents broke up. Dad was going to Minas Gerais to work, and the rest of us â€” me, Mum and my two brothers and my two sisters â€” were going to Nova VenÃ©cia. That was where I started my dream, really, because I enrolled at a football school there. On the first day I turned up with butterflies in my stomach. I was already fantasising about playing for the <em>SeleÃ§Ã£o</em>. I owned a Brazil shirt. I would watch all the World Cups and the qualifiers. I had no bigger dream than to put on the yellow jersey.Â </p><p>On that morning we were playing on a clay pitch. It was so much fun, and the coach liked me. Over the next few months I trained harder and harder. I also realised that football was not just a career path for me. It could also help my family. We were five people living in a house with two rooms in total, and my mum was working every day to make sure we had enough to eat. She is such a fighter. But she couldnâ€™t do it all on her own, and pretty soon she began asking us to help her out.Â </p><p>So when I was 11, I got a job. I began selling ice pops.</p><p>Look, I know it sounds random. But for me it was a natural thing to do. My great-granddad was famous in the town for selling them. For years he had been sitting in the square with his cart. Now he was running his little business with my cousin, so during the summers I would join him. Iâ€™d get up at 6 a.m., wheel the cart downtown and spend the day shouting like one of those match-day programme sellers you see outside the football stadiums. â€œIce pops! Ice pops! Get yer ice pops here!â€</p><p>I always made sure to walk past the houses that had the most children. What kid doesnâ€™t like an ice pop? But even though I sold a lot, I didnâ€™t earn much. So I had to do other jobs, too, to help my mum. I sold chocolate candies that my aunt had made.Â </p><p>And then there was the car wash.Â </p><p>Oh man, the car washâ€¦.Â </p><p>Look, I thought it was going to be an easy job. How hard could it be, right? Well, it turned out to be brutal. I was spending entire days soaping up muddy tires and scrubbing dirty windshields. By the time my shift was over my body was aching. It was killing me!Â </p><p>At one point my boss actually wanted to give me the job full-time. I was like, â€œSorry man, this isnâ€™t for me!â€ I never came back.Â </p><p>I also helped out my granddad on the farm. We would stay out all day in what felt like 50Â°C, harvesting coffee. I used to sweat and toil so much I was nearly crying! Then I would look over at my granddad and he was having the time of his life. I was like, <em>How is it possible?!Â </em></p><p>But seriously, I admired his work ethic. It was inspiring. He, too, was a fighter.Â </p><p>He taught me other stuff as well. Sometimes I would hide from him, because I knew heâ€™d tell me off for hanging out with â€¦ well, letâ€™s just say they were the wrong kind of people. There was a lot of crime and drugs in my area, and I had some friends who were involved in it. When my mum was out working, I would go with one of my brothers out in the streets. We saw guns, bags full of money â€¦ we saw it all. Thank God, I never went looking for anything in that world. But one time that world came looking for me.</p><p>It happened when I was 14. I was walking home with a friend after having played football. It was about 8 p.m., so it was dark. Suddenly these two crazy guys came out of nowhere and pointed guns at us.</p><p>We were scared as hell. If one had pulled the trigger, even accidentally, weâ€™d have been dead.Â </p><p>We tried to explain the situation. Basically they thought we were trying to sell things in their spot. We showed them the ball we were carrying and said that we were just on our way home. Perhaps they had mistaken us for someone else. Anyway, after a very tense spell, they let us go.</p><p>Afterwards we tried to make light of it saying things like, â€œDude, you nearly s**t your pants back there.â€ We were still just kids, making fun of everything.</p><p>In any case, after all my experiences in Nova VenÃ©cia, I realised I had no choice. I wanted nothing to do with drugs. I wasnâ€™t a farmer. Selling ice pops wasnâ€™t my thing. And I sure as hell wasnâ€™t gonna go back to the car wash.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-042e88f840d9fde0ff8502eef9519f12.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Richarlison"><figcaption>Courtesy of Richarlison</figcaption></figure><p>Basically, I couldn&#39;t see myself doing anything other than playing football.Â </p><p>Not that I needed to tell my friends that. They understood it once they saw my football shirt collection. I was walking around with the colours of Chelsea and Milan, I had the jerseys of Drogba and IbrahimoviÄ‡.Â </p><p>And Neymar, of course. Neymar was my idol. I had his Santos shirt. On the pitch I tried to pull off his moves. I played in his position. I even copied his hairstyle.Â </p><p>You know the yellow mohawk? I had that one!Â </p><p>But wanting to be Neymar is one thing, another is to actually play as a pro. So in 2013, when I was 15, I began looking for a contract.Â </p><p>I first spent a month on trial with AvaÃ­, a team in FlorianÃ³polis, some 1,800 kilometres down the coast from Nova VenÃ©cia. The way these things work is that you stay at the academy full-time, train hard and hope that theyâ€™ll give you a deal. The competition is so intense. At AvaÃ­ I went to bed with bruised shins almost every day. Then, after four weeks, a guy from the club told us that they werenâ€™t going to be taking in any new players after all. So, yeah â€¦ thanks. All that work for nothing.Â </p><p>What can you say? It was just a huge injustice.</p><p>I had a second trial lined up with Figueirense, in the same city. I had so little money left that I had to borrow boots from someone at the club. Again, I put my life on the line in training. Even though I was supposed to be there for only a week, the coach invited me for a second week. I was competing with nine other kids for one of two spots. In the end I spent another month running and fighting to get noticed.</p><p>And then Figueirense rejected me, too.Â </p><p>And when did I get the news?</p><p>On my 16th birthday.Â Â </p><p>I was devastated. I felt as if nothing was working out. I remember receiving all these jolly greetings from friends and family â€” â€œHappy birthday! :-Dâ€ â€” and yet all I could think about was that I had to go back to my mum in Nova VenÃ©cia. The trials were over.</p><p>I had to go looking for another job.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-cecd109570a14de445b818afab5d1656.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="James Williamson/AMA/Getty Images"><figcaption>James Williamson/AMA/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>To be honest, I might have thrown in the towel if I hadnâ€™t had people around to support me. My dad was one of them. My granddad was another. Then there was Fidel â€” a police officer and a football coach â€” who I had played a lot of futsal with. â€œNever give up,â€ he said. Another one was Regis, who ran the football school. He had some good contacts, and one day he found a new team for me: Real Noroeste, a club close to Nova VenÃ©cia that was playing in the EspÃ­rito Santo state championship.Â </p><p>So I played for them for a year, and I evolved a lot.Â </p><p>But then they treated me very badly.Â </p><p>I had developed so much that year that AmÃ©rica-MG wanted to sign me. They were a bigger club and I wanted to go there. The guys from Real Noroeste told my dad that there would be no problem with my transfer. But then they demanded half of the fee. They were saying one thing and doing another. It was a huge issue for my dad. We both knew AmÃ©rica would be my last chance to make it, and their youth team had only four matches left of the season. For him to have to sort that out under that sort of pressure, at a time when he was struggling with depression â€¦ it hurt me a lot. I made some good friends at Real Noroeste, but to this day I donâ€™t like to talk too much about that club.Â </p><p>In any case, I went to AmÃ©rica for a final shot at a contract. I guess the trial could have ended with another rejection. I donâ€™t know. One thing I am sure of, though, is that after we went on that fishing trip and my dad was humiliated, I got another source of motivation. I found a gear I didnâ€™t know I had.Â </p><p>So I began training even harder. The goals started to fly in. The coaches took notice.Â </p><p>And in December 2014, I was offered a contract by AmÃ©rica.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s hard to describe the feeling when you finally get something you have chased for so long. I had been through so much pain and so many setbacks. Now I was finally able to help my family. My mum no longer had to worry. My dad could quit his job.Â </p><p>And I could play and train without worrying so much. First I made the AmÃ©rica first team. Then in 2016 I signed for Fluminense, one of the biggest clubs in Brazil. That enabled me to buy my first house, in Nova VenÃ©cia.</p><p>Thanks to God, it all worked out.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-eefdb9dd720e75a4374a07525dd021c8.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>After that break my motivation shifted. The fishing story had driven me for a long time. Now I was focusing more on what had initially motivated me as a kid: playing for Brazil.Â </p><p>Moving to Europe was important. In 2017, when I was 20, I signed for Watford. Many people doubted that I could make it in the Premier League because a lot of Brazilians struggle when they first come over. But I never felt that pressure. I was just happy to be there.Â </p><p>Instead, the real issues took place off the pitch.Â </p><p>The language was one; I spoke no English. The weather was another. When I arrived it was sunny, so it felt like Brazil, but in November I could no longer feel my toes when I was playing, and by Christmas I had lost contact with my hands. That was tough, especially for someone who had never seen snow before.</p><p>Then there was the food. For the first two weeks I stayed in a hotel with my agent and his wife. In the morning we went downstairs to eat and ... well, letâ€™s just say that in Brazil, weâ€™re not used to fries for breakfast. In fact, the food was so strange to me that I skipped breakfast altogether. I started a diet of two meals a day. The menu? Burgers and Coca-Cola. They were the only things I was familiar with.</p><p>I ate like that for two weeks. I lost five kilos.Â </p><p>Thankfully I eventually adapted, and I want to give a big thank you to Heurelho Gomes, my best friend at Watford, who helped me so much. <em>Obrigado</em>. I still remember the first time I played against Manchester City, and not just because we lost 6â€“0 at home! I was so special to stand next to their players in the tunnel before the game â€” stars like Sergio AgÃ¼ero and Kevin De Bruyne. They were players I had met only in video games, and now I was about to play against them. Honestly, I felt like a little kid again.Â </p><p>Anyway, I did well enough in one season at Watford to get a move to Everton. And then, just a month later, I got my first call-up for Brazil.Â </p><p>I had been hoping for a call because I had started off well at Everton. I remember watching the squad announcement on TV. My name was not there, but I was like, <em>Thatâ€™s O.K, Iâ€™ll keep trying. My chance will come. </em>Then Pedro, the winger, unfortunately got injured. Suddenly Professor Tite called me. I felt a strange sensation in my body. Iâ€™m not sure how to explain it. My heart was thumping. He asked me if I was ready. I was like, â€œProfessor, Iâ€™m ready! When do you need me??â€Â </p><p>When I turned up to join the squad, I felt like I had arrived on another planet. I thanked God for the opportunity. I couldnâ€™t believe I was about to put on the yellow shirt.Â </p><p>For my first two games, which were friendlies against the U.S. and El Salvador, I got the number 9 shirt. It felt twice as heavy as any other shirt I had worn because, you know, it used to belong to the main man, Ronaldo. Obviously thatâ€™s a little bit, I donâ€™t know â€¦ <em>crazy</em>.Â </p><p>Both games were special. The first because it was my debut, and I got to play the last 15 minutes. The second because I started up front next to Neymar â€” and I scored two goals.</p><p>Playing with Neymar was incredible. I had met him once before, in his house in Paris, but I had only had time to take a picture with him. This time we were sharing the pitch. I had already told him that Iâ€™d once copied his yellow mohawk.Â </p><p>He just burst into laughter.Â </p><p>Now we are great friends. He always looks for me when he has the ball, and I feel we can become a great duo. It was a shame that he could not take part when we won the Copa AmÃ©rica last year. But the next World Cup will be another for us to win a trophy together. I just want to make sure we keep winning in the qualifiers and get there in good shape.</p><p>Until that happens, I just want to do my best for Everton. Sometimes my friends ask me if I miss Brazil and my family. Even though my life is great on Merseyside, of course I do.Â </p><p>But I came a long way to get here, and I donâ€™t want to stop now. There are millions of Brazilian kids who are trying to go the same way.</p><p>To those kids I just want to repeat the advice that I got five years ago.Â </p><p>Never give up.Â </p><p>Itâ€™s the fighters who make it.Â </p><h2>Save Pantanal</h2><p>Now that I have told you one story, you might as well hear another.Â Â </p><p>After I had finished the season with Watford in 2018, I went straight on holiday with some friends. We went camping and fishing in Brazil.Â </p><p>One of the areas we visited was Pantanal, in the southwestern state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Pantanal is famous for being the biggest tropical wetland in the world â€” a beautiful place, full of rare plants and animals. At one point during the trip, we drove past a village, and when we spotted a group of kids playing football there, we stopped the car and asked if we could join them. I feel fortunate that I got to play with them. Before we left I gave a football shirt to the village chief.</p><p>I spent nearly a week in Pantanal and had so much fun. I would recommend that place to anyone.Â </p><p>That is, whatever is left of it nowâ€¦.Â </p><p>I want to speak about something that matters a lot to me, and that should matter a lot to you, too. Iâ€™m sad and worried about what has happened to Pantanal. About a quarter of the whole region has been on fire this year. In the beginning I was seeing it on the news all the time, which made sense â€” itâ€™s an area we should all fight to protect.Â </p><p>But I didnâ€™t see anyone doing anything about it.Â </p><p>Which raises the question: Why?Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-fd298a2fbc991187a2a80fe746304afb.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune"><figcaption>Sam Robles/The Players' Tribune</figcaption></figure><p>Look, Iâ€™m not a politician. I canâ€™t stop the fires on my own. But as a player for Brazil and Everton, I can show people whatâ€™s going on. So I have posted a few pictures on social media in support of Pantanal. Not just to show sympathy, but to make the authorities wake up.Â </p><p>Right now there is way too much greed in politics. Some people do whatever they can to win elections, but once they have power they just exploit it for their own gain. And that ends up harming Brazil. I want the authorities to know that we are concerned about our country and its natural resources.Â Â </p><p>Some of my Everton teammates asked me about Pantanal when they saw the posts. I showed them some more pictures of the fires and they were shocked. They all knew about the wildlife in Brazil, but they didnâ€™t know about the dangers it was facing.Â </p><p>Guys, let me be clear here: It <em>is </em>very bad.<em>Â </em></p><p>So I hope, through posts and campaigns, that we can all mobilise enough people to make the authorities wake up and do more to save the wetlands. People with many followers need to speak out. People who have authority need to use it.Â </p><p>The earth is our greatest treasure. Letâ€™s make sure we take care of it.Â </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAA9AAAAIk-3cd8aa3126afd8d13fd5c3da96b078d7.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>At the Universal CityWalk in Orlando, there used to be an NBA store. It might as well have been heaven when I was six years old. There was a LeBron statue out front. It was huge. On the inside there were rows and rows of NBA jerseys, and balls stacked from the floor to the ceiling â€” and I wanted to touch them all. I remember just going from aisle to aisle, grabbing each jersey and turning it around to see the name on the back.</p><p>JAMES </p><p>BRYANT</p><p>NOWITZKI</p><p>Iâ€™d call my dad over to show him my favorite ones. I could have spent all day there. That place was special because we didnâ€™t have anything like it back home in France. My parents and I came to America every summer during my dadâ€™s off-season. He played pro basketball for Cholet, just outside of Nantes. When his season would end weâ€™d head back to where Dad grew up, in the Central Florida area, and Iâ€™d get to live for a few months as an American kid. </p><p>I was born in Florida, yes, but I was raised in France. </p><p>In Cholet, the NBA felt like it was a million miles away. </p><p>Every day, when I got out of elementary school, Mum would come pick me up at four oâ€™clock and take me home. Iâ€™d rush through my homework and then wait until nobody was using our family computer, and then Iâ€™d get on the Internet. Thatâ€™s how I used to learn about the NBA. On YouTube, Iâ€™d watch hours and hours of And1 mixtapes and highlight videos of my guys, like Dwyane Wade and Bron. If I could go back and check my Internet history from back then, Iâ€™m sure it would be just pages and pages of links like, â€œBEST CROSSOVERS 2008/09â€ and â€œJUMPER COMPILATION NBA.â€</p><p>I rarely, if ever, saw a full game. So to me, those players were literal human highlight reels who were capable of doing anything on the court. </p><p>Thatâ€™s why, when we walked into the NBA store in Orlando, seeing their jerseys was like touching Supermanâ€™s cape, or something like that.</p><p>My favorite part, though, was the hand imprints they had on the wall. They had Kobe and Bron on there, but the wildest one was Shaq â€” no doubt. I think I could have fit five of my hands inside his palm. He was a big deal in Orlando, too, of course. There were pictures of him all over the store, and his jersey was everywhere. </p><p>NBA basketball made me proud to have been born there. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-4e27fcb3035c565d023d8cac3d6e94aa.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Killian Hayes"><figcaption>Courtesy of Killian Hayes</figcaption></figure><p>Because I had been born in the States, and my dad was from there, I felt like I was a part of American basketball. Like I was closer to it than all the kids I played with back in France. Even as a seven- or eight-year-old boy, I was always proud to introduce myself in class as Killian Hayes, from Lakeland, Florida. </p><p>Cholet isnâ€™t that big of a place. My elementary school was near our house, and most of the kids lived in the same neighborhood. When I wasnâ€™t watching NBA highlights after school, Iâ€™d be out at the field playing soccer with my friends. I never played on any organized teams â€” because once I put my hand inside Shaqâ€™s, I knew I wanted to play basketball forever â€” but everyone in town played soccer, so thatâ€™s what I did. And in class, all the kids would talk about Ronaldo and Messi, not Bron and Kobe. </p><p>But one thing I want to make clear is this: France is absolutely a basketball country, too. </p><p>We might not have the international pedigree of other European countries, and certainly not the U.S., but there is a great basketball culture in France. </p><p>I learned that from going to my dadâ€™s games in Cholet. </p><p>The atmosphere at those games was more like a Champions League soccer match than it was an NBA game. The crowds were loud, and they were smart. They respected the crisp, dagger bounce pass just as much as they loved the dunk.</p><blockquote>The atmosphere at those games was more like a Champions League soccer match than it was an NBA game.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>When Mum was busy, Iâ€™d go to my dadâ€™s practices from time to time after school, and I learned a lot there. Dad would lower the hoop for me and pick me up and let me dunk. As I got a bit older, heâ€™d run me through drills. Heâ€™s a big guy, 6 &#39;6&#34; and 230 pounds. So for a long time he was pretty stiff competition. I couldnâ€™t post him up until a few years ago. </p><p>He pushed me hard, but he never forced me to play basketball. </p><p>Dad had played college ball in the States, and I knew his journey hadnâ€™t been straightforward. He never made it to the league and he had to grind really hard in Europe to make a name for himself. He knows the game of basketball â€” and the world of basketball â€” more than most people. </p><p>I think he knew that if I wanted to do this, like if I <em>really </em>wanted to try to be a basketball player, then I had to love it. I had to love coming to the gym each day. I had to love the process. And when I got to be 11 or 12 years old, he saw that in me. I was a determined boy. When Iâ€™d come back to America in the summers, and weâ€™d go down to the rec center and Iâ€™d play against some really good players who were older than me, thatâ€™s when I knew I could play this game. </p><p>My dream wasnâ€™t just to play basketball forever. </p><p>All those YouTube videos and trips to the CityWalk had left a mark on me.</p><p>My dream was to play in the NBA. </p><p>But the road from Cholet to the NBA draft was hard to navigate. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4QAYRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAAAAAAAA-fa36fd1d2781a02e27a4dcfe889da491.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Courtesy of Killian Hayes"><figcaption>Courtesy of Killian Hayes</figcaption></figure><p>When I was 14, my dad was considering coming back to Florida to try to play professionally. So we also talked about me going to one of the big high schools in the States to get myself ready for college ball. </p><p>And I wanted that, real bad. I had seen so many videos online of the McDonaldâ€™s All American games and the big AAU tournaments and all those different youth basketball events. There was so much hype, and all those guys were choosing between different colleges to go to â€” it just seemed like the dream. But my parents and I did a lot of talking about the best route to take going forward, and it didnâ€™t include going to America. </p><p>A part of me was a bit disappointed when we came to the decision, but I understood. I trusted my dad and his experience with the high school and college system in America. Itâ€™s not that itâ€™s bad or canâ€™t produce great players â€” lots of superstar players go through it â€” but he just felt that for me, the most important thing was to learn how to be a great <em>pro</em>. </p><p>Heâ€™d say, â€œAll the five-star ratings, all the hype videos â€” they donâ€™t mean anything if you get to the NBA and canâ€™t make it work as a professional basketball player.â€</p><p>But at the end of the day, the decision was still mine. And with all of the options laid out in front of me, I decided to stay in France and become a professional player at Cholet. </p><p>I played my first game as a pro at 16 years old. Most kids that age are juniors in high school, but there I was going up against grown men â€” playing for their livelihoods, in games that truly mattered to the clubs. The teams in France rely on the prize money for making the playoffs and the gate proceeds to stick around, so each game really matters. It made me see the game a bit differently. </p><p>There wasnâ€™t time to make mistakes, there wasnâ€™t time to play like a rookie. </p><blockquote>There wasnâ€™t time to make mistakes, there wasnâ€™t time to play like a rookie.<cite></cite></blockquote><p>When Iâ€™d hold on to the ball for too long, or try to make a play on my own, the coach would always yell at me. I had grown up being one of the better players on my junior teams, and Iâ€™d gotten used to forcing plays from time to time because I knew I had the ability to do it. But at the pro level, I couldnâ€™t do that. </p><p>Being on edge like that ... it made me uncomfortable. But I learned quickly that the best way to grow was to <em>be</em> uncomfortable. I got better as a player because I had to, because there was no other choice. I knew I wouldnâ€™t play much if I couldnâ€™t get into the lineup. My dad knew that, and I also think he knew that I would rise to the challenge. </p><p>I had to mature quickly. No time to complain about playing time, or who gets the ball when. We were in the business of winning games. That was what mattered.Â </p><p>My older teammates helped me out, on and off the court. I couldnâ€™t get my drivers license in France until I was 18, so my first few years with Cholet my parents and teammates used to have to drive me to and from practices and games. People always offered to help because they knew I cared so much about Cholet. I had been going to the arena since before I can remember. I knew the club really well. Itâ€™s one big family. </p><p>When I think of Cholet, I think of guys like Abdoulaye Ndoye and Warren Woghiren â€” who started their pro careers around the same time I did. They helped me so much in the weight room and on the court, and also helped me grow as a player and a professional. They showed me that I could do this, that I could be a pro. That was when the NBA changed for me from a dream to an objective. </p><p>That might sound the same to you, but itâ€™s not. A dream is something that you imagine, something you donâ€™t expect to happen. An objective is something you cross off a list â€” something you <em>know</em> you can do. </p><p>You just gotta go do it. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagejpegbase649j4R4VRXhpZgAASUkqAAgAAAATAAABA-99432cfb65d8d7a53a90a66e55f07373.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="TF-Images/Getty Images"><figcaption>TF-Images/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>So in 2019, I took the next step in my career and decided to move away from home. I went to Germany to play for ratiopharm Ulm in the Basketball Bundesliga. It was a chance to test my game even more, to make myself more uncomfortable. We played in the EuroCup against some of the best teams from all over the continent. It was an incredible experience, a chance to see the game in different parts of the world â€” it was just really rewarding. </p><p>I used to watch March Madness highlights as a boy. The sold-out football stadiums going crazy for Duke and North Carolina â€¦ I thought it was just the coolest thing ever. Thatâ€™s why the decision to stay in Europe was tough. I wanted that college experience. But if I could go back in time and tell myself to have confidence in the choice, to keep the faith, I would talk about the places the game can take you. </p><p>I was 18 years old and playing pro basketball in Germany. I was travelling to Italy, Spain and all these other places to play a <em>game</em>. I learned more than I ever could have imagined and I have zero regrets about the path I was fortunate enough to take.</p><p>All of those experiences have prepared me for whatâ€™s next. </p><p>Iâ€™m ready to cross an objective off my list. </p><p>Iâ€™m ready to be a professional basketball player in the NBA. </p><p>Everything Iâ€™ve done in my life has been leading to this moment. </p><blockquote>Everything Iâ€™ve done in my life has been leading to this moment. <cite></cite></blockquote><p>Itâ€™s funny, I got a DM from Tony Parker the other day on Instagram. He was just saying hello and that he wanted to talk sometime, give me some advice. Heâ€™s obviously a legend and I was shocked to see it. But it made me realize something â€” or at least it made me think about something I used to dream about. </p><p>During all the interviews with the NBA teams before the draft, they would ask me about what type of player I wanted to be. I told them the truth â€” about the dream that had been with me since I was a little kid: I want to be a great pro, just like my dad taught me to be. I want to be a teammate who guys in the room can rely on. And I want to be a leader on the court.</p><p>But I also told them that I am incredibly proud of where I was raised. </p><p>I want to be one of the best players to come out of France, just like Tony. </p><p>Right now, itâ€™s a dream, too. But I know I can turn it into an objective. </p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagepngbase64iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAACFUAAASw-d75fef05e8de692a968b2af6037dc66c.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Youâ€™d like my workouts. Iâ€™ve always got the music blasting.</p><p>When Iâ€™m on the court, reggae helps me get into the right zone. All reggae. Only reggae.</p><p>Reggae reminds me of home. The Bahamas. Eight Mile Rock. Thatâ€™s my home and Iâ€™ll never forget it. Back there, weâ€™ve got our own reggae music. You might never have heard these tracks but if you spent a week with me, itâ€™d become your favorite music, too. I guarantee you.</p><p>Eight Mile Rock taught me about a lot of things in life, and one of those things is the energy you can get from music. Reggae has great beats, but more than anything it tells stories. It talks to me. It talks to me about my home and reminds me of the struggles that my six brothers and sisters all went through. It talks to me about the guys on the corners dealing drugs who never bothered me because they knew my mom (everyone knew my mom). It tells my story in a way that movies and books and other stories canâ€™t.</p><p>When Iâ€™m working out, my music reminds me that Iâ€™m happy and free to pursue my dreams. It makes me want to work that much harder because Iâ€™ve learned not to take anything for granted. Going through the draft process feels unreal to me. I used to watch the draft when I was a kid and it seemed so far away. I know how much work I have put in to get to the point where Iâ€™m have the opportunity to go to the NBA. I couldnâ€™t have done it without my family and God and a bunch of good people at my side.</p><p>I donâ€™t talk about my childhood so that you should feel sorry for me, but I do want to show people how motivated I am. I know how hard I work and how much I love this game.</p><p>Whatever situation I find myself in next year, Iâ€™m going to go as hard as I can. I want to compete with the best in the world.</p><p>But first, I want to enjoy this process. After I shake the commissionerâ€™s hand, Iâ€™ll be thinking about everybody from Eight Mile Rock whoâ€™s rooting and cheering for me. I see you guys. I know what type of music youâ€™ll be playing back home tonight. Turn it up for me.</p><p>                                                                                                 ***</p><figure><img

        <![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, when I was going back and forth about whether to make the jump to the NBA after one season at Duke, I took a walk over to Coach Kâ€™s office.<br/><br/>I didnâ€™t know what to expect when I got there.<br/><br/>One of the things I knew about Coach from back in the day was that he wasnâ€™t a fan of the whole one-and-done thing. He wanted players to come to Duke and stay â€” ideally for a full four years. Then, when I got to campus in the fall of 2017, I talked to some guys whoâ€™d played at Duke before I got there and they told me about how Coach K would be fuming whenever players would leave early. So all that was the backdrop.<br/><br/>Anyway, I walk in, and sit down, andâ€¦.<br/><br/>It was like I was talking to a totally different person from the guy in those stories.</p><p>The first thing out of Coachâ€™s mouth was how he thought Iâ€™d had a great season. He told me Iâ€™d performed really well, and that he was proud of me for how consistent Iâ€™d been all year long. It was one of the nicest conversations Iâ€™ve ever had, especially because it was coming from someone I have so much respect and admiration for.<br/><br/>When I mentioned what was on my mind, Coach K told me that he felt like I would make a great pro, and gave a few reasons why. At one point he just said, â€œIâ€™d obviously love to have you back, but I think you gotta go for it.â€</p><p>Coach knew that I was someone who took academics very seriously, and he made it a point to say Duke University wasnâ€™t going anywhere. â€œYouâ€™ll be able to come back and get your degree later,â€ he told me. â€œYou will always be welcome here. But this is your time to show what you can do against the best in the world.â€<br/><br/>Coach K â€¦ he encouraged me to leave.<br/><br/>At a time when I was on the fence as to what I was going to do, it was actually Coach K who convinced me to make the leap.<br/><br/>And that right there showed me so much about Coach. It shows heâ€™s adapted. He gets it. He understands that times change. And you know what? On that day he gave me some of the best professional advice Iâ€™ve ever received.</p><figure><img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/upload/c_fill,w_1440,ar_16:9,f_auto,q_auto,g_auto/shape/cover/sport/dataimagewebpbase64UklGRjafAQBXRUJQVlA4ICqfAQBwxQa-0123354e57649469c441dc410b6c7017.jpg" data-has-syndication-rights=0 HasImageSyndicationRights=0 data-license-id="UserUpload" data-licensor-name="UserUpload" data-portal-copyright="Rob Carr/Getty Images"><figcaption>Rob Carr/Getty Images</figcaption></figure><p>With the 2020 draft coming up, and the deadline for underclassmen to declare right on the horizon, I felt like I wanted to try to pay it forward a bit by sharing some advice with those who are currently going through the decision-making process. And my very first tip has to do with that story I told above. Itâ€™s this: Rely heavily on the people you respect and trust most, and those who you know have your best interests in mind. Coach K was definitely one of those people for me. You need to find your inner circle and stick with those folks.<br/><br/>Beyond that, you have to think about your familyâ€™s economic situation, about whether your game would benefit from more college ball, and about the one thing everyone always mentions: the risk of injury. As for the rest of my thoughts and tips on the decision to leave school early, check them out below.</p><ul><li>The 2020 draft is going to be unlike any other in history: Have to mention this one pretty high up, right? I mean, weâ€™re living through unprecedented times right now. Obviously basketball stuff isnâ€™t anywhere near the most important issue at this point, right in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, but whatâ€™s going on has meant that current draft prospects are in a tough situation that players like me didnâ€™t have to deal with. No individual workouts? No combine? No predraft camps? No in-person meetings? Basically your game tape is going to have to be good enough. So if youâ€™re someone who maybe didnâ€™t put up huge numbers last season, but who kills it when it comes to measurables and workouts, this honestly might not be your year.</li></ul><ul><li>Donâ€™t let something that just happened, or your emotions, dictate your decision: After we lost to Kansas in the 2018 NCAA tournament, I remember my mom and a few of my aunties came to campus to see me. We started talking about my decision, and at that point â€¦ I was totally ready to come back. I wanted to play for my school again. And win a title. But, I mean, that was literally one day after being bounced from the tourney. That was my competitive side taking over, my emotional side. You canâ€™t make a good decision that way.</li></ul><ul><li>You have to be cool with a lot of downtime: College and the NBA couldnâ€™t be more different. In college, when you wake up youâ€™ve got a roommate or housemates. Thereâ€™s almost always someone you can talk to and hang out with. In the league â€¦ some younger guys do live with someone, but for the most part a lot of people are living alone. And not everyoneâ€™s built for that. We practice maybe two hours a day, max. So there are 22 hours or so left to fill. You have to take care of your home, and find some hobbies, as well. You have to be mature. With me, I definitely underestimated the whole free time thing. At Duke, our days were scheduled from sunup to sundown. Then that all disappeared.</li></ul><ul><li>Listen to the people who know: If you know people who have direct experience with what itâ€™s like to be a professional athlete â€¦ talk to them. Learn as much as you can from those people. With me, my dad played pro ball down in the Dominican Republic. While thatâ€™s not the same as the NBA, he knew all about what being a professional athlete is like. My dad did everything in his power to make sure I knew what to expect, be it physically, emotionally â€¦ everything. He talked to me about money management, about friends, women â€” just everything imaginable that sometimes trips guys up. Those lessons have been invaluable.</li></ul><ul><li>Donâ€™t go crazy with mock drafts: I definitely looked at the online mock drafts. Itâ€™s almost impossible not to. I really tried not to fixate on them, though. More than anything, I used them to motivate me. Iâ€™d see a mock that had me going 12th or 13th, and Iâ€™d take it as a challenge. But overall I didnâ€™t get too caught up in people online guessing where I might get picked. At the end of the day, whether they have you going first or 51st â€¦ <em>itâ€™s just a mock.</em> Itâ€™s not real life. Beyond that, the one other thing Iâ€™ll add is that it is a bit of a different situation if youâ€™re looking at the mocks and â€¦ youâ€™re not seeing your name at all. Trying to put myself in those shoes, especially now â€” in a year when there are no individual workouts to improve your draft stock â€” youâ€™re really going to have to bet on yourself and take a leap. At the same time, though, no oneâ€™s going to believe in you unless you believe in yourself. And there are lots of guys who thought they were going to get picked, but who didnâ€™t, and who then worked their way to the NBA and had long careers anyway. But, yeah, not seeing your name at all? Thatâ€™s gotta give you something to think about for sure.</li></ul><ul><li>Donâ€™t get caught up listening to students at your school or superfans: This is a simple one. A lot of people are going to try to influence your decision, and deciding who to listen to can sometimes be tough. Other times, though, itâ€™s â€¦ not so tough. Donâ€™t let students at your school or superfans of the college influence you. Theyâ€™re not looking out for you. Period. Moving onâ€¦.</li></ul><ul><li>Prepare for people coming out of the woodwork and asking for stuff: The money that goes along with playing in the league is a blessing. Donâ€™t get me wrong. But once you declare for the draft, and people know youâ€™re heading to the NBA, youâ€™re going to start hearing from folks hoping to cash in. So be ready to deal with it. My advice is going to be the same advice that I got from veteran teammates on the Bulls when I was a rookie: â€œFind a nice way to tell people no.â€ Everyoneâ€™s way of getting that message across to folks is going to be a little bit different, but itâ€™s a must. You just have to find the way that works best for you.</li></ul><ul><li>Before making a decision, sit down for an hour or two with the people you trust the most and go through everything again: For me, this was my mom and dad, but it doesnâ€™t necessarily have to be family. Just gather the people who you count on most, and who you know will always have your back no matter what â€¦ and have a conversation where everything is laid out on the table. It may seem like youâ€™ve already gone over everything a million times. But trust me, you wonâ€™t regret having that one last conversation about it. And youâ€™ll probably remember that talk for the rest of your life.</li></ul><ul><li>After you decide, try not to second-guess yourself: This one is easier said than done, I admit. I can tell you that after I made my decision, I definitely had some regrets creep in, some second-guessing. I found myself thinking: <em>What if I had stayed? Maybe we would have won it all? Would I have improved my draft stock?</em> And even after I got to the league, when Duke was on TV battling it out at Cameron Indoor against UNC â€¦ Iâ€™d still be sitting there thinking, What if? But after a while you realize thereâ€™s nothing positive that can come from those thoughts. You just have to make a decision, believe in yourself, and then put all your energy into becoming the very best player you can. For me, that meant working hard so I could make my family proud. But it also amounted to me telling myself: <em>Trust Coach K, and go prove him right.</em></li></ul>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>North Carolina&#39;s finest, aka TG3, the Georgia Bulldog himself, Todd Gurley, stops in to chat with the guys on this episode of <em>Truss Levelz.</em> Did you know that TG3 started off as a track phenom? Well, he did. Our man has <em>speed</em> speed. Youâ€™ll hear about him traveling the world to race. Why he nearly went to Princeton instead of Georgia â€” a move that couldâ€™ve turned him into a podcaster instead of an NFL star. The crazy time at Georgia. His ACL tear and entry to the league. And when he realized he could play his game at the highest level. We should probably mention how he drops hints at what itâ€™s like as a member of Roc Nation. Along with food and travel spots. I mean, what more do you need? TG3, now TG33 for the Atlanta Falcons, is the former Offensive Player of the Year, three-time Pro-Bowler, two-time All Pro First Team selection. Just call him Mr. Accolade. His dreads are pretty fire, too. Turn the volume up. You donâ€™t want to miss out on this one.Â </p><hr />]]>

The pride of Kitchener, Canada, joins <em>Knuckleheads with Quentin Richardson and Darius Miles </em>to go over everything, including his jump to stardom. They start off with Canada, what it was like playing ball there, how hard it was to get attention from the big-time schools and why Jamal is so proud that Canadian players are finally getting respect. Then he talks about going to Kentucky and what it was like playing under Coach Cal for a year. It was one and done and on to the draft. Jamal reveals that he didnâ€™t even work out for Denver and explains why he thought he couldâ€™ve been teamed up with Devin Booker in Phoenix. He then talks about his quiet-yet-effective start in the NBA, and what changed when he entered the Bubble this past summer. Then itâ€™s to the moon â€” Jamal discusses dropping 50 points again and again and again, what it was like going back and forth against Donovan Mitchell, and why the Nuggets felt confident even when they were down 3â€“1 â€¦ twice! Lastly, you wonâ€™t want to miss Jamal ranking his greatest Canadian players and explaining why he <em>still</em> doesnâ€™t own a car despite being in his fifth year in the league. A young superstar on the rise, Jamal Murray starts off Season 5 with a bang.Â </p><hr />]]>
